I have a question about np-complete problems this problem is left as an exercise by the reader : ) seriously , most of them are probably np-complete , some are n't -- -- what exactly is going on on the floor of the new york stock exchange ? stock exchange and new york stock exchange do not yet contain an answer does n't that happen every day ? i 've added a little more of a description of the trading floor to new york stock exchange it 'd be nice if someone could clarify some other things , though , e.g : 1 ) what powers the nyse employee has over the stock she 's managing , and 2 ) how the traders actually on the nyse floor connect back to people that invest without physically going to nyse -- Ryguasu 08:56 dec 26 , 2002 ( utc ) -- -- i would like to know what kind of work the prisonsers in Auschwitz ii Birkenau ( those that were not gassed on arrival ) had to do on a daily basis as an exercise to the reader ( writer ! ) : you must find an appropriate place to answer this question in the encyclopedia since a voltage can only be measured across two points , the statement that '' the voltage of point x is y volts '' is meaningless unless you know what point the measurement was relative to if somebody one day replaced the si system with another , then the volt would become obsolete , and '' potential difference '' would be measured in fnuts or whatever in the case of a water circuit , you could measure it by connecting the two points with a pipe which has an elastic membrane in its middle , so that no water can actually flow through as the battery runs down and its internal resistance increases , the proportion of its internal voltage that gets through the internal resistance to appear at the load gets smaller , so the battery 's ability to deliver power to the load decreases measuring the voltage of a battery with no load ( called its open-circuit voltage ) tells you very little about its state of charge at this point the voltage will appear to drop suddenly , because the battery is no longer able to drive the tiny current that your voltmeter needs to make its measurement
