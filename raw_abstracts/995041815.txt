A perfect game in Major League Baseball is a game in which a pitcher (or combination of pitchers) pitches a victory that lasts a minimum of nine innings and no opposing batter reaches base.<ref name="MLB-perfect-game"></ref> To achieve a perfect game, a team must not allow any opposing player to reach base by any means, including hits, walks, hit batsmen, uncaught third strike, interference (baseball), or fielding errors; in short, "27 up, 27 down" (for a nine-inning game). The feat has been achieved 23 times in MLB history&nbsp;– 21 times since the modern era began in 1901, most recently by Félix Hernández of the Seattle Mariners on August 15, 2012. A perfect game, by logical necessity, is also a no-hitter and a shutout. A fielding error that does not allow a batter to reach base, such as a misplayed foul ball, does not spoil a perfect game.<ref name="MLB-rules"></ref> Weather-shortened contests in which a team has no baserunners and games in which a team reaches first base only in extra innings do not qualify as perfect games under the present definition.
The first confirmed use of the term perfect game was in ; the term's current definition was formalized in . Although it is theoretically possible for several pitchers to combine for a perfect game (as has happened 11 times at the major league level for a no-hitter), to date, every major league perfect game has been thrown by a single pitcher.<ref></ref>
