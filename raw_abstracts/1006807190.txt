Baker's yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used in baking bread and bakery products, serving as a leavening agent which causes the bread to rise (expand and become lighter and softer) by converting the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,<ref name="isbn0-387-38563-0-cite4"></ref> and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.<ref></ref> Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body.
The use of steamed or boiled potatoes,<ref name="urlReport on Vienna bread - Google Books"></ref> water from potato boiling,<ref name="urlA hand-book of industrial organic . - Google Books"></ref> or sugar in a bread dough provides food for the growth of yeasts; however, too much sugar will dehydrate them.<ref name="isbn0-306-47363-1"></ref> Yeast growth is inhibited by both salt and sugar, but more so by salt than sugar.<ref name="isbn0-387-38563-0-cite2"></ref> Some sources say fats, such as butter and eggs, slow down yeast growth;<ref name="isbn1-58816-398-9"></ref> others say the effect of fat on dough remains unclear, presenting evidence that small amounts of fat are beneficial for baked bread volume.<ref name="isbn0-387-38563-0-cite3"></ref>
Saccharomyces exiguus (also known as S. minor) is a wild yeast found on plants, grains, and fruits that is occasionally used for baking; however, in general, it is not used in a pure form but comes from being propagated in a sourdough starter.
