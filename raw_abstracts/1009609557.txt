Heteronormativity is the belief that heterosexuality is the default, preferred, or normal mode of sexual orientation.<ref name="Harris"></ref> It assumes the gender binary (i.e., that there are only two distinct, opposite Gender) and that sexual and marital relations are most fitting between people of opposite sex. A heteronormative view therefore involves alignment of biological sex, sexuality, gender identity and gender roles. Heteronormativity is often linked to heterosexism and homophobia.<ref name="Harris"/><ref name="Gorski"></ref> The effects of societal heteronormativity on lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals can be examined as heterosexual or "straight" privilege.<ref></ref>
