Carl Auer von Welsbach, who received the hereditary title Freiherr von Welsbach (1 September 1858&nbsp;â€“ 4 August 1929)<ref name="NYT"></ref> 
was an Austrian scientist and inventor, who separated didymium into the elements neodymium and praseodymium in 1885. He was also one of three scientists to independently discover the element lutetium (which he named cassiopeium), separating it from ytterbium in 1907, setting off the longest priority dispute in the history of chemistry.<ref name="Lebenswerk"/>
He had a talent not only for making scientific advances, but also for turning them into commercially successful products. 
His work on rare-earth elements led to the development of the ferrocerium "flints" used in modern lighters, the gas mantle, which brought light to the streets of Europe in the late 19th century, and the metal-filament light bulb.<ref name="Fame"/><ref name="Iles"></ref>
