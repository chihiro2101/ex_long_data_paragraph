The United States Constitution provides that each "House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings,"<ref>U.S. Const. Art. I, Sec. V, Clause II</ref> therefore each United States Congress, upon convening, approves its own governing rules of procedure. This clause has been interpreted by the courts to mean that a new Congress is not bound by the rules of proceedings of the previous Congress.<ref>United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 5 (1892)</ref>
Currently the procedures of the United States House of Representatives are governed by the Constitution, the House Rules, and Jefferson's Manual.
