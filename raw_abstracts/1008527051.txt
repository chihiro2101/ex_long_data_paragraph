Erwin Chargaff (11 August 1905 â€“ 20 June 2002) was an Austro-Hungarian-born American biochemist, writer, Bucovinian Jew, who emigrated to the United States during the Nazi era and was a professor of biochemistry at Columbia University medical school.<ref></ref> Through careful experimentation, Chargaff discovered two rules, called Chargaff's rules, that helped lead to the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA.
The first parity rule was that in DNA the number of guanine units is equal to the number of cytosine units, and the number of adenine units is equal to the number of thymine units. This hinted at the base pair makeup of DNA.
 
The second parity rule was discovered in 1968.<ref></ref> It states that, in single-stranded DNA, the number of adenine units is approximately equal to that of thymine, and the number of cytosine units is approximately equal to that of guanine. 
He also observed that the relative amounts of guanine, cytosine, adenine and thymine bases vary from one species to another. This hinted that DNA rather than protein could be the genetic material.
Chargaff was also a great writer. He left behind an important humanistic opus. His memoirs, Heraclitean Fire,<ref></ref> is arguably<ref> </ref><ref> </ref> one of the best autobiographies written by a scientist and should be read by anyone who is interested in Science and in Humanities. The book is freely available at the Rockefeller University Press.<ref name="site"></ref>
