Traffic congestion is a condition in transport that is characterised by slower speeds, longer trip times, and increased vehicular queueing. Traffic congestion on urban road networks has increased substantially, since the 1950s.<ref></ref> When traffic demand is great enough that the interaction between vehicles slows the speed of the traffic stream, this results in some congestion. While congestion is a possibility for any mode of transportation, this article will focus on automobile congestion on public roads.
As demand approaches the capacity of a road (or of the intersections along the road), extreme traffic congestion sets in. When vehicles are fully stopped for periods of time, this is known as a traffic jam<ref></ref><ref></ref> or (informally) a traffic snarl-up.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Traffic congestion can lead to drivers becoming frustrated and engaging in road rage.
Mathematically, traffic is modeled as a flow through a fixed point on the route, analogously to fluid dynamics.
