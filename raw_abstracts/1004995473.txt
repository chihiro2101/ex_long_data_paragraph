There are various names of Korea in use today, all derived from ancient kingdoms and dynasties. The modern English name "Korea" is an exonym derived from the name Goryeo, also spelled Koryŏ, and is used by both North Korea and South Korea in international contexts. In the Korean language, the two Koreas use different terms to refer to the nominally unified nation: Chosŏn , in North Korea and Hanguk , in South Korea. Ethnic Koreans living in China and Japan also use the term Chosŏn to refer to Korea.
