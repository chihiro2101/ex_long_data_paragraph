Edward was the first member of the royal family to live in North America for more than a short visit (1791&ndash;1800) and, in 1794, the first prince to enter the United States (travelling to Boston on foot from Lower Canada) after independence. He is credited with the first use, on 27 June 1792, of the term "Canadian" to mean both French and English settlers in Upper and Lower Canada. The Prince used the term in an effort to quell a riot between the two groups at a polling station in Charlesbourg, Lower Canada.<ref>Nathan Tidridge, "Prince Edward, Duke of Kent: Father of the Canadian Crown (Toronto, Dundurn Press, 2013), 90.</ref> In the 21st century, he has been styled the "Father of the Canadian Crown" for his impact on the development of Canada.<ref>Michael Taube, "A Neglected Royal" (Toronto: Literary Review of Canada, 2013), 43.</ref>
