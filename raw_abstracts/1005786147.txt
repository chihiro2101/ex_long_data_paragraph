Nubians are an ethnolinguistics group of people who are indigenous to the region which is now present-day Northern Sudan and southern Egypt. They originate from the early inhabitants of the central Nile valley, believed to be one of the earliest cradle of civilization.<ref>Charles Keith Maisels (1993).

Early Neolithic settlements have been found in the central Nubian region dating back to 7000 BC, with Wadi Halfa believed to be the oldest settlement in the central Nile valley.<ref></ref> Parts of Nubia, particularly Lower Nubia, were at times a part of ancient Pharaonic Egypt and at other times a rival state representing parts of Meroë or the Kingdom of Kush. By the Twenty-fifth Dynasty (744 BC–656 BC), all of Egypt was united with Nubia, extending down to what is now Khartoum.<ref name="britannica.com"></ref> However, In 656 BC the native Twenty-sixth Dynasty regained control of Egypt. As warriors, the ancient Nubians were famous for their skill and precision with the bow and arrow.<ref></ref>Nubia was not fully dominated by the Romans, but in Augustan times there was possibly a "client state" of Rome in northern Nubia.
In the Middle Ages, the Nubians converted to Christianity and established three kingdoms: Nobatia in the north, Makuria in the center, and Alodia in the south.
Today, Nubians in Egypt primarily live in southern Egypt, especially in Kom Ombo and Nasr al-nuba north of Aswan,<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> and large cities such as Cairo, while Sudanese Nubians live in northern Sudan, particularly in the region between the city of Wadi Halfa on the Egypt–Sudan border and al Dabbah.Some Nubians migrated to Khashm el Girba and New Halfa.
Additionally, several groups known as the Hill Nubians live in the northern Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan state, Sudan.<ref></ref> The main Nubian groups from north to south are the Kenzi, Faadicha (Halfawi), Sukkot, Mahas, and Danagla.<ref name="Lobban"></ref>There also exists two large tribes of fully arabized Nubians who inhabit Northern Sudan - these groups are known as the Shaigiya and Ja'alin.
