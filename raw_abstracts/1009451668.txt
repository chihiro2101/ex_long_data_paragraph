A T-shirt, or tee shirt, is a style of fabric shirt named after the T shape of its body and sleeves. Traditionally, it has short sleeves and a round neckline, known as a crew neck, which lacks a collar. T-shirts are generally made of a stretchy, light and inexpensive fabric and are easy to clean. The T-shirt evolved from undergarments used in the 19th century and, in the mid-20th century, transitioned from undergarment to general-use casual clothing.
Typically made of cotton textile in a Jersey (fabric), it has a distinctively pliable texture compared to shirts made of woven cloth. Some modern versions have a body made from a continuously knitted tube, produced on a knitting machine, such that the torso has no side seams. The manufacture of T-shirts has become highly automated and may include cutting fabric with a laser or a water jet. 
T-shirts are very economically cheap to produce and are often part of fast fashion, leading to outsized sale of t-shirts compared to other attire.<ref></ref> For example, 2 billion t-shirts are sold a year in the United States,<ref></ref> or the average person from Sweden buys nine t-shirts a year.<ref></ref> Production processes, vary but can be environmentally intensive, and include the environmental impact caused by their materials, such as cotton which is both pesticide and water intensive.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
