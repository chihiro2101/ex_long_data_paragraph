Walter Richard Sickert (31 May 1860 â€“ 22 January 1942) was a British painter and printmaker who was a member of the Camden Town Group of Post-Impressionism artists in early 20th-century London. He was an important influence on distinctively British styles of avant-garde art in the mid- and late 20th century.
Sickert was a cosmopolitan and eccentric who often favoured ordinary people and urban scenes as his subjects. His work includes portraits of well-known personalities and images derived from press photographs. He is considered a prominent figure in the transition from Impressionism to Modernism.
