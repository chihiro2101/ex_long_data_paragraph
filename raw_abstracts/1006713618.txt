Artificial consciousness<ref name="gunn"></ref> (AC), also known as machine consciousness (MC) or synthetic consciousness ; , is a field related to artificial intelligence and cognitive robotics. The aim of the theory of artificial consciousness is to "Define that which would have to be synthesized were consciousness to be found in an engineered artifact" .
Neuroscience hypothesizes that consciousness is generated by the interoperation of various parts of the brain, called the neural correlates of consciousness or NCC, though there are challenges to that perspective. Proponents of AC believe it is possible to construct systems (e.g., computer systems) that can emulate this NCC interoperation.<ref name="Graziano Consciousness and the Social Brain"></ref>
Artificial consciousness concepts are also pondered in the philosophy of artificial intelligence through questions about mind, consciousness, and mental states.<ref>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach includes the Philosophy foundations of AI including the questions of consciousness urltoken Russell, Stuart J., Norvig, Peter, 2003, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, </ref>
