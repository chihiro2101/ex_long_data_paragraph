Self-esteem is an individual's subjective evaluation of their own worth. Self-esteem encompasses beliefs about oneself (for example, "I am unloved", "I am worthy") as well as emotional states, such as triumph, despair, pride, and shame.<ref></ref> Smith and Mackie (2007) defined it by saying "The self-concept is what we think about the self; self-esteem, is the positive or negative evaluations of the self, as in how we feel about it."<ref name="SmithMackie"></ref>
Self-esteem is an attractive psychological construct because it predicts certain outcomes, such as academic achievement,<ref></ref><ref name="ecuador"></ref> happiness,<ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /> satisfaction in marriage and relationships,<ref name="Orth 2014"></ref> and criminal behavior.<ref name="Orth 2014"/> Self-esteem can apply to a specific attribute (for example, "I believe I am a good writer and I feel happy about that") or globally (for example, "I believe I am a bad person, and I feel bad about myself in general"). Psychologists usually regard self-esteem as an enduring personality characteristic (trait self-esteem), though normal, short-term variations (state self-esteem) also exist.
