The MSN web app provide users information from sources that publish to MSN.
Microsoft launched these apps along with the 2014 redesign of the MSN web portal, rebranding many of the Bing apps that originally shipped with Windows and Windows Phone. News, Weather, Sports, Money, and Travel first shipped with Windows 8, while Health & Fitness and Food & Drink first appeared in Windows 8.1.<ref name=WMPowerUser></ref><ref name=PhoneArena1></ref> In December 2014, the apps became available across all the other major mobile device platforms as well: iOS, Android, and Fire OS.<ref name=WinBetamsnapps></ref><ref></ref><ref name=msnappsdroidlife></ref><ref name=AndroidAndMe></ref><ref name=msnappsAndroidCentral></ref>
The apps allow users a reasonable amount of freedom to decide which sources provide information. Each app has its own color code that is used on the live tile and internally. Originally, each app brought a unified experience with the MSN website and synchronized preferences across devices; for example, setting a list of stocks to watch on MSN.com would show the same data on the MSN Money app on all devices where the user was signed in with a Microsoft account. The synchronization was dropped when the apps were rebuilt for Windows 10.
There are currently four apps in the suite: News, Weather, Sports, and Money.<ref name=cnetrebrandapps></ref> In July 2015, Microsoft announced the discontinuation of the Food & Drink, Health & Fitness, and Travel apps on all platforms, and that they will not be bundled with Windows 10; those three apps are no longer offered.<ref name=pcw-appsdiscontinued></ref>
