East Turkestan, also East Turkistan ; , varies in meaning by context and usage. The term was coined in the 19th century by Russian Turkology including Nikita Bichurin to replace another Western term, Chinese Turkestan, which referred to the Tarim Basin in the southwestern part of Xinjiang during the Qing dynasty. The medieval Persian toponym "Turkestan" and its derivatives were not, however, used by the local population. The Uyghur name for the Tarim Basin is Altishahr, which means "Six Cities" in Uyghur. Besides, China had since the Han dynasty had its own name for an overlapping area: the "Western Regions." The parts of this area controlled by China were termed "Xinjiang" starting in the 18th century. 
From the 20th century on, Uyghur separatists and their supporters used East Turkestan (or Uyghurstan) as an appellation for the whole of Xinjiang or for a future independent state in present-day Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (presumably with Ürümqi as its capital). They reject the name of Xinjiang (meaning "New Frontier" in Chinese) because of the Chinese perspective reflected in the name and prefer East Turkestan to emphasize connection to other, westerly, Turkic groups. However, even in nationalist writing, East Turkestan retained its older, more narrow geographical meaning.
