Frank Donald Goodish (June 18, 1946 – July 17, 1988) was an American professional wrestler who earned his greatest fame under the ring name Bruiser Brody. He also worked as King Kong Brody, The Masked Marauder, and Red River Jack. Over the years Brody became synonymous with the hardcore wrestling brawling style that often saw one or more of the participants bleeding by the time the match was over. In his prime he worked as a "special attraction" wrestler in North America, making select appearances for various promotions such as World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW), WWE (WWF), Central States Wrestling (CSW), Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWFF), and the American Wrestling Association (AWA) among others. He worked regularly in Japan for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW).
Behind the scenes Goodish was very protective of his "in-ring" image, hardly ever agreeing to lose matches and building a reputation of being volatile; he would on occasion intentionally hit or hurt opponents during a match contrary to the pre-determined nature of professional wrestling. His in-ring work and wrestling persona earned him an induction in the professional wrestling hall of fame, St. Louis Wrestling Hall of Fame, Southern Wrestling Hall of Fame, Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame and the WWE Hall of Fame.
Goodish died in 1988 from stab wounds suffered backstage in a shower during a wrestling event in Puerto Rico. The killer was José Huertas González, the wrestler known as Invader I. A jury acquitted González of murder, ruling that González killed Goodish in self-defense. Key witnesses to the killing did not give testimony at González's trial due to their summons only being received after the trial had concluded.<ref name=newsAU/>
