The Confederation of Cinque Ports <ref></ref> is a historic series of coastal towns in Kent, Sussex and Essex.<ref name=EB1911></ref> It was originally formed for military and trade purposes, but is now entirely ceremonial. The ports lie at the eastern end of the English Channel, where the crossing to the continent is narrowest. The name is Norman French, meaning "five ports". They were:
*Hastings
*New Romney
*Hythe
*Dover
*Sandwich
Rye, originally a subsidiary of New Romney, was raised as one of the Cinque Ports after New Romney was damaged by the severe 1287 storm; its harbour silt, and the River Rother shifted course closer to Rye. As a result, New Romney rapidly lost importance in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
