An example of the objectives of Jewish Community Centers can be seen within the New Bedford, Massachusetts branch's Constitution. In January 1947, the Jewish Community Center of New Bedford listed the following objectives:
* To foster and develop the highest values of Jewish spiritual and cultural life.
* To provide social, educational, literary, benevolent, recreational and athletic activities for the benefit of Jewish men, women, and children of New Bedford.
* To serve the spiritual, intellectual, social, and physical welfare of its members.
* To fulfill the great ideals of American citizenship.<ref>Jewish Community Center Records, 1944â€“1977. Manuscript Collection. (MC 21). Claire T. Carney Library Archives and Special Collections, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, Dartmouth, MA.</ref>
