In J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy writings, Isengard is a large fortress in Nan Curunír, the Wizard's Vale, in the west of Middle-earth. It is supposedly a translation of Angrenost in the elvish language Sindarin, in reality from Old English, meaning "iron enclosure".
Orthanc, the tower at the centre of Isengard, was at the time of The Lord of the Rings the home of the Wizard Saruman. He had been ensnared by the Dark Lord Sauron through the tower's palantír, a far-seeing crystal ball able to communicate with others like it. Saruman had bred Orcs in Isengard, in imitation of Sauron's forces, ready for war with Rohan. The Orcs cut many trees of the forest of the Ents, who retaliated by destroying Isengard while the army of Orcs was away attacking Rohan at Helm's Deep, though they were unable to harm the tower of Orthanc. Saruman, isolated in the tower, was visited by some of the Fellowship; his staff was broken by the Wizard Gandalf.
Isengard has been described by scholars as an industrial hell, and as illustrating the homogeneity of evil, in contrast to the evident diversity of the free societies of Middle-earth including those of the Elves, Dwarves, and Gondor. It has been compared to Vichy France, and its proposed governor on behalf of Mordor, the Mouth of Sauron, to a traitorous Quisling.
