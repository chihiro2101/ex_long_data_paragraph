Byron De La Beckwith Jr. (November 9, 1920 â€“ January 21, 2001) was an American white supremacist and Klansman from Greenwood, Mississippi, who assassinated the civil rights leader Medgar Evers on June 12, 1963. Two trials in 1964 on that charge, with all-white juries, resulted in hung jury. In 1994, he was tried by the state in a new trial based on new evidence, convicted of the murder, and sentenced to life in prison.
