A parish council is a civil local authority found in England and is the lowest tier of local government.<ref name=whatis></ref> They are elected corporate bodies, have variable tax raising powers, and are responsible for areas known as civil parishes, serving in total 16 million people. A parish council may decide to call itself a Town Council (if the parish covers a town), Village Council, Community Council, Neighbourhood Council, or if the parish has city status, the parish council may call itself a City Council. However the powers and duties of the parish council are the same whatever name it carries.<ref>Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007</ref>
Civil parish councils were formed in England under the reforming Local Government Act 1894 to take over local oversight of civic duties in rural towns and villages from the vestry committee.
Parish and town councils vary enormously in size, activities and circumstances, representing populations ranging from fewer than 100 (small rural hamlets) to up to 100,000 (Sutton Coldfield Town Council). Most of them are small: around 80% represent populations of less than 2,500;<ref name=reviews/> and two thirds spend under Â£25,000 per year. They are generically referred to as "Local Councils", and most are affiliated via County Associations to the National Association of Local Councils (NALC), which represents their interests at a national level.<ref>NALC home page on website urltoken </ref>
