Stefan Dragutin , ; 1244 – 12&nbsp;March 1316) was King of Serbia from 1276 to 1282. From 1282, he ruled a separate kingdom which included northern Serbia, and (from 1284) the neighboring Hungarian banates (or border provinces), for which he was unofficially styled "King of Syrmia". He was the eldest son of King Stefan Uroš&nbsp;I of Serbia and Helen of Anjou. Dragutin married Catherine of Hungary, likely after his father concluded a peace treaty with her grandfather, Béla&nbsp;IV of Hungary, in 1268. By 1271, he received the title of "young king" in recognition of his right to succeed his father. He rebelled against his father, and with Hungarian assistance, forced him to abdicate in 1276.
Dragutin abandoned Uroš&nbsp;I's centralizing policy and ceded large territories to his mother in appanage. After a riding accident, he abdicated in favor of his brother, Milutin, in 1282, but he retained the northern regions of Serbia along the Hungarian border. Two years later, his brother-in-law, Ladislaus&nbsp;IV of Hungary, granted him three banates—Mačva (or Sirmia ulterior), Usora and Soli—to him. He was the first Serbian monarch to rule Belgrade. With his brother's support, he also occupied the Braničevo (region) in 1284 or 1285.
In theory, Dragutin was a vassal both to his brother (for his Serbian territories), and to the Hungarian monarchs (for the four banates), but in practice he ruled his realm as an independent ruler from the 1290s. His conflicts with Milutin developed into open war in 1301, and he frequently raided the neighboring Hungarian lords from 1307. Most of the Serbian noblemen supported Dragutin, but he was forced to make peace with Milutin after Milutin's mercenary routed him in 1311 or 1312. Before his death, he entered a monastery and died as the monk Teoktist. On the list of Serbian saints, Dragutin is venerated on 12&nbsp;November or 30&nbsp;October (Old Style and New Style dates).
