Laissez-faire ; ; from is an economic system in which transactions between private groups of people are free from or almost free from any form of economic interventionism such as regulation and Subsidy. As a system of thought, laissez-faire rests on the axioms<ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/> that the individual is the basic unit in society and has a natural right to freedom; that the physical order of nature is a harmonious and self-regulating system; and that corporations are creatures of the state and therefore the citizens must watch them closely due to their propensity to disrupt the Smithian spontaneous order.<ref>Adam Smith, urltoken Wealth of Nations, p. 52: "The exclusive privileges of corporations, statutes of apprenticeship, and all those laws which restrain, in particular employments, the competition to a smaller number than might otherwise go into them, have the same tendency, though in a less degree. They are a sort of enlarged monopolies, and may frequently, for ages together, and in whole classes of employments, keep up the market price of particular commodities above the natural price, and maintain both the wages of the labour and the profits of the stock employed about them somewhat above their natural rate."</ref>
These axioms constitute the basic elements of laissez-faire thought. Another basic principle holds that markets should be competitive, a rule that the early advocates of laissez-faire always emphasized.<ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/> With the aims of maximizing freedom and of allowing markets to self-regulate, early advocates of laissez-faire proposed a imp√¥t unique, a land value tax (similar to Georgism) to replace all taxes that they saw as damaging welfare by penalizing production.<ref></ref>
