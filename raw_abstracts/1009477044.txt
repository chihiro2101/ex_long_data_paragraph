Christian Identity (also known as Identity Christianity)<ref name="Doctrine"/> is an interpretation of Christianity which advocates the belief that only Germanic, Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Nordic, Aryan people and people of kindred blood are the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and are therefore the descendants of the ancient Israelites.
Independently practiced by individuals, local church, and some prison gangs, it is not an organized religion, nor is it affiliated with specific Christian denominations. Its theology is a racial interpretation of Christianity.<ref name="eck"></ref><ref name="buck"></ref> Christian Identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by authors who regarded Europeans as the "chosen people" and Jews as the cursed offspring of Cain, the "serpent hybrid" or serpent seed (a belief which is known as the two-seedline doctrine).<ref name="Doctrine"></ref> White supremacist sects and gangs later adopted many of these teachings.<ref name="BehindBars"></ref>
Christian Identity promotes the idea that all non-whites (people who are not of wholly European descent) will either be Genocide or Slavery in order to serve the white race in the new Heavenly Kingdom on Earth under the reign of Jesus Christ. Its doctrine states that only "Adamic" (white) people can achieve salvation and enter paradise. Many of its adherents are Millennialism.
It is considered Racism,<ref name="SPLC"></ref> anti-Semitic,<ref name="SPLC" /> and White supremacy by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
