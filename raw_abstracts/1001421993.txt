The lawsuit was filed in 2003, it has lingered on through the bankruptcy of SCO Group and the adverse result in SCO v. Novell, and was reopened for continued litigation by order of a new judge on June 14, 2013.<ref name=gl130615></ref><ref name=at130617></ref> Pursuant to the court order reopening the case, an IBM Motion for Summary Judgment was filed based upon the results of the Novell decision.<ref name=gl130916></ref> On December 15, 2014, the judge granted most of IBM's motion,<ref name=ibm1132></ref> thereby narrowing the scope of the case, which remained open.
