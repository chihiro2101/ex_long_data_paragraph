The Invasion of the Waikato became the largest and most important campaign of the 19th-century New Zealand Wars. Hostilities took place in the North Island of New Zealand between the military forces of the colonial government and a federation of Iwis known as the Māori King Movement.<ref name="Belich"></ref> The Waikato is a territorial region with a northern boundary somewhat south of the present-day city of Auckland. The campaign lasted for nine months, from July 1863 to April 1864. The British invasion aimed at crushing Kingite power (which European settlers saw as a threat to British authority)<ref name="king"></ref> and also at driving Waikato Māori from their territory in readiness for occupation and settlement by Europeans.<ref name="dalton"></ref><ref>

Plans for the invasion were drawn up at the close of the First Taranaki War in 1861 but the Colonial Office and New Zealand General Assembly opposed action, and the incoming Governor Sir George Grey (second term: 1861-1868) suspended execution in December of that year. Grey reactivated the invasion plans in June 1863 amid mounting tension between Kingites and the colonial government and fears of a violent raid on Auckland by Kingite Māori. Grey used as the trigger for the invasion Kingite rejection of his ultimatum on 9 July 1863 that all Māori living between Auckland and the Waikato take an oath of allegiance to Queen Victoria or be expelled south of the Waikato River.<ref name="Belich" /> Government troops crossed into Waikato territory three days later and launched their first attack on 17 July at Koheroa, but were unable to advance for another 14 weeks.
The subsequent war included the Battle of Rangiriri (November 1863)—which cost both sides more men than any other engagement of the New Zealand Wars<ref name="Belich8"></ref>—and the three-day-long Battle of Ōrākau (March-April 1864), which became arguably the best-known engagement of the New Zealand Wars and which inspired two films called Rewi's Last Stand.<ref name="Belichorakau"></ref> The campaign ended with the retreat of the Kingitanga Māori into the rugged interior of the North Island and the colonial government confiscating about 12,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of Māori land.
The defeat and confiscations left the King Movement tribes with a legacy of poverty and bitterness that was partly assuaged in 1995 when the government conceded that the 1863 invasion and confiscation was wrongful and apologised for its actions.<ref>Waikato Raupatu Claims Settlement Act 1995, s 6."Text in English"</ref> The Waikato–Tainui tribe accepted compensation in the form of cash and some government-controlled lands totalling about $171&nbsp;million—about 1 percent of the value of the lands confiscated in 1863—and later that year Queen Elizabeth II personally signed the Waikato Raupatu Claims Settlement Act 1995.<ref> urltoken "Queen’s Royal Assent Returns Maori Land", Shona Geary</ref><ref>
