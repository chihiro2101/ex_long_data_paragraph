The Battle of Shrewsbury was a battle fought on 21 July 1403, waged between an army led by the Lancastrian King Henry IV and a rebel army led by Henry Percy (Hotspur) from Northumberland. The battle, the first in which English archers fought each other on English soil, reaffirmed 
the effectiveness of the longbow and ended the Percy challenge to King Henry IV of England.<ref name=EH></ref>
