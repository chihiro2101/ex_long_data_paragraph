Herophilos ; ; 335â€“280 BC), sometimes Latinised Herophilus, was a Greek physician deemed to be among the earliest Anatomy. Born in Chalcedon, he spent the majority of his life in Alexandria. He was the first scientist to systematically perform scientific dissections of human cadavers. He recorded his findings in over nine works, which are now all lost. The early Christian author Tertullian states that Herophilos vivisected at least 600 live prisoners;<ref name="galen1"> urltoken Galen. On Semen. DeLacy P (trans.)
