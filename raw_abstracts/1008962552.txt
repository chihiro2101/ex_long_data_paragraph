The Vauxhall Astra is a C-segment that has been sold by Vauxhall since 1979. It is currently produced in Ellesmere Port in the United Kingdom. 
For its first two generations, the nameplate was applied to right-hand drive versions of the Opel Kadett for use in the UK. Since 1991, Opel has used the Astra nameplate on its B/C-platform. General Motors' Saturn division in the United States also offered a Belgian-built<ref> urltoken version of the Astra as a captive import from late 2007 until Saturn was discontinued following GM's 2010 bankruptcy.
