In economics and marketing, product differentiation (or simply differentiation) is 
the process of distinguishing a product or service from others, to make it more attractive to a particular target market. This involves differentiating it from Competition' products as well as a firm's own products. The concept was proposed by Edward Chamberlin in his 1933 The Theory of Monopolistic Competition.<ref></ref>
