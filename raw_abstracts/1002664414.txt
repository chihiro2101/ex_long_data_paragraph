A flash flood is a rapid flooding of low-lying areas: washes, rivers, dry lakes and depressions. It may be caused by heavy rain associated with a severe thunderstorm, hurricane, tropical storm, or meltwater from ice or snow flowing over ice sheets or snowfields. Flash floods may also occur after the collapse of a natural ice or debris dam, or a human structure such as a man-made dam, as occurred before the Johnstown Flood of 1889. Flash floods are distinguished from regular floods by having a timescale of fewer than six hours between rainfall and the onset of flooding.<ref></ref> The water that is temporarily available is sometimes used by certain plants for growth.<ref name="How flooding affects plants"></ref> However, plants that thrive in drier areas can be harmed by flooding, as the plants can become stressed by the large amount of water.<ref name="How flooding affects plants"></ref>
