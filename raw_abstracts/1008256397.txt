A handshake is a globally widespread, brief greeting or parting tradition in which two people grasp one of each other's like hands, in most cases accompanied by a brief up-and-down movement of the grasped hands. Using the right hand is generally considered proper etiquette. Customs surrounding handshakes are specific to cultures. Different cultures may be more or less likely to shake hands, or there may be different customs about how or when to shake hands.<ref name="germ-latimes"></ref><ref name="germ-abcnews"></ref><ref name="germ-cbc"> urltoken Fist bump can pound out flu transmission </ref>
