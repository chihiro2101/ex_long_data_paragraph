A lantern is an often portable source of lighting, typically featuring a protective enclosure for the light source — historically usually a candle or a oil lamp, and often a battery-powered light in modern times — to make it easier to carry and hang up, and make it more reliable outdoors or in drafty interiors. Lanterns may also be used for signaling, as torches, or as general light-sources outdoors.
