The Transformers toy-line is typically divided into two main factions: the heroic Autobots and their opponents, the evil Decepticons (traditionally known in Japan as the Cybertrons and Destrons, respectively, although more recent releases often use the English terms). Transformers toys are sold at a number of price points, and various Transformers series utilize unique play features.
There have also been a number of spin-offs based on the toys including a comic book series, an Transformers series, and a The Transformers: The Movie. The original series program was followed by a number of spin-offs and reboots with varying levels of popularity. A live-action film series directed by Michael Bay has produced five films, with more planned.
