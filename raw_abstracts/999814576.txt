Lifespring, founded in 1974, was a private, for-profit, human potential organization. Lifespring stated they trained more than 400,000 people through its ten centers across the United States. 
Lifespring encountered significant controversy; various academic articles published in psychology journals in the 1970s and 1980s characterized Lifespring's training methods as "deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control", and featured allegations that Lifespring was a cult that coerced members from leaving. 
After these allegations were highlighted in a 1987 article in the Washington Post and local television reporting in communities where Lifespring had a significant presence, Lifespring changed its name to the "Legacy Center." The Legacy Center was also met with controversy, and when it was under investigation by the North Carolina Attorney General's office for allegedly defrauding its members, it changed its name to the "Gratitude Center."
