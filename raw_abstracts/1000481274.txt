In heraldry, tenné ;<ref name="OxfAm"></ref><ref name="Oxf"></ref> sometimes termed tenny<ref name="OxfAm"/> or tawny) is a "stain", or non-standard tincture, of orange (in English blazonry), light brown (in French heraldry) or orange-tawny (in continental heraldry) colour.<ref>Fox-Davies, on p. 72, uses orange and tenné synonymously and in the next sentence defines tenné as "an orange-tawny colour." Leigh, as quoted by Woodcock & Robinson, on p. 52, defines tenne as "orenge colour"sic. Neubecker, on p. 86, on the other hand, equates tenné with brown, as distinct from orange.</ref>
Tenné, however, is not to be confused with Brunâtre ("brownish") of French and German blazons. <gallery mode="nolines" widths="80" perrow="2" caption="Difference between tenné & brunâtre">
