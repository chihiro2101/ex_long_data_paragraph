A speakeasy, also called a blind pig or blind tiger, is an illicit establishment that sells alcoholic beverages. Such establishments came into prominence in the United States during the Prohibition era (1920&ndash;1933, longer in some states). During that time, the sale, manufacture, and transportation (rum-running) of alcoholic beverages was illegal throughout the United States.<ref> urltoken "Speakeasy".
