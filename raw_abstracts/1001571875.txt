Chinese astrology has a close relation with Chinese philosophy (theory of the three harmonies: heaven, earth, and water), and uses the principles of yin and yang and concepts that are not found in Western astrology, such as the wuxing (five phases), the ten Heavenly Stems, the twelve Earthly Branches, the Chinese calendar (moon calendar and sun calendar), and the time calculation after year, month, day, and shichen , double hour).
