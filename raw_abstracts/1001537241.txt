Methaqualone is a sedative and hypnotic medication. It was sold under the brand names Quaalude and Sopor among others, which contained 300mg of methaqualone, and sold as a combination drug under the brand name Mandrax which contained 250mg methaqualone and 25mg diphenhydramine within the same tablet, though mostly in Europe. Commercial production of methaqualone was halted in the mid 1980s due to widespread abuse and addictiveness. It is a member of the quinazolinone class.
The sedativeâ€“hypnotic activity of methaqualone was first noted in 1955. In 1962, methaqualone was patented in the United States by Wallace and Tiernan.<ref></ref> Its use peaked in the early 1970s for the treatment of insomnia, and as a sedative and muscle relaxant.
Methaqualone became increasingly popular as a recreational drug and club drug in the late 1960s and 1970s, known variously as "ludes" or "disco biscuits" due to its widespread use during the popularity of disco in the 1970s, or "sopers" (also "soaps") in the United States and "mandrakes" and "mandies" in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. The substance was sold both as a free base and as salt (hydrochloride).
