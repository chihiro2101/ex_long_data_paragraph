Causality is the relationship between causes and effects.<ref>Green, Celia (2003). The Lost Cause: Causation and the Mindâ€“Body Problem. Oxford: Oxford Forum. . Includes three chapters on causality at the microlevel in physics.</ref><ref>Bunge, Mario (1959). Causality: the place of the causal principle in modern science. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.</ref> While causality is also a topic studied from the perspectives of philosophy, from the perspective of physics, it is operationalized so that causes of an event must be in the past light cone of the event and ultimately reducible to fundamental interactions. Similarly, a cause cannot have an effect outside its future light cone.
