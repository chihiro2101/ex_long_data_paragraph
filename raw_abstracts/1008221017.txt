The mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata), also known as the mandarin or mandarine, is a small citrus tree fruit. Treated as a member of a distinct species of orange,<ref name="morton"/> it is usually eaten plain or in fruit salads.<ref name="morton"></ref> The tangerine is a group of orange-coloured citrus fruit consisting of hybrids of mandarin orange with some pomelo contribution.
Mandarins are smaller and oblate, unlike the spherical common oranges (which are a mandarin-pomelo hybrid).<ref name=morton/> The taste is considered less sour, as well as sweeter and stronger.<ref name="karp"></ref> A ripe mandarin is firm to slightly soft, heavy for its size, and pebbly-skinned. The peel is thin, loose,<ref name="morton"/> with little white mesocarp,<ref name="latimes"></ref> so they are usually easier to peel and to split into segments.<ref name=morton/> Hybrids usually have these traits to a lesser degree. The mandarin is tender and is damaged easily by cold. It can be grown in tropical and subtropical areas.<ref name=morton/><ref name=karp/>
According to genetic studies, the mandarin was one of the original citrus species; through breeding or natural hybridization, it is the ancestor of many hybrid citrus cultivars. With the citron and pomelo, it is the ancestor of the most commercially important hybrids (such as sweet and sour oranges, grapefruit, and many lemons and limes). The mandarin has also been hybridized with other citrus species, such as the desert lime and the kumquat.<ref name="Talon"/> Though the ancestral mandarin was bitter, most commercial mandarin strains derive from hybridization with pomelo, which give them a sweet fruit.<ref name="Wang" />
