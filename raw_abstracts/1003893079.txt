An art car is a vehicle that has had its appearance modified as an act of personal artistic expression. Art cars are often driven and owned by their creators, who are sometimes referred to as "Cartists".
Most car artists are ordinary people with no artistic training.<ref>"'Art cars' find a lane on the main drag: Quirky creations gaining popularity." USA Today. 16 September 2003. 7D. Web. Academic Search Premier.</ref> Artists are largely self-taught and self funded, though some mainstream trained artists have also worked in the art car medium. Most others agree that creating and driving an art car daily is its own reward. Artists like Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and others have designed BMW Art Cars and their work has been reflected in racing cars like the BMW V12 LMR.
