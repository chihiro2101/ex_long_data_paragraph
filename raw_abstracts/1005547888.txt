The law of the instrument, law of the hammer,<ref>
</ref> Maslow's hammer (or gavel), or golden hammer is a cognitive bias that involves an over-reliance on a familiar tool. As Abraham Maslow said in 1966, "I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail."<ref name=maslow66/>
The concept is attributed both to Maslow<ref>
</ref> and to Abraham Kaplan,<ref>
</ref><ref></ref> although the hammer and nail line may not be original to either of them.
