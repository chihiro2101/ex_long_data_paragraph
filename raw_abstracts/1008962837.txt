Tocqueville thought the conquest of Algeria was important for two reasons: first, his understanding of the international situation and France's position in the world; and second, changes in French society.<ref name="Monde diplomatique"></ref> Tocqueville believed that war and colonization would "restore national pride, threatened", he believed, by "the gradual softening of social mores" in the middle classes. Their taste for "material pleasures" was spreading to the whole of society, giving it "an example of weakness and egotism".<ref name="mondediplo806">Alexis de Tocqueville, "Rapports sur l'Algérie", in , Paris, Gallimard, Bibliothèque de la Pléiade, 1991, p. 806, quoted in </ref>
Applauding the methods of General Bugeaud, Tocqueville went so far to claim that "war in Africa is a science. Everyone is familiar with its rules and everyone can apply those rules with almost complete certainty of success. One of the greatest services that Field Marshal Bugeaud has rendered his country is to have spread, perfected and made everyone aware of this new science".<ref name="mondediplo806"/>
Tocqueville advocated racial segregation in Algeria with two distinct legislations, one for European colonists and one for the Arab population.<ref>, p. 752. Quoted in </ref> Such a two-tier arrangement would be fully realised with the Adolphe Crémieux and the Indigénat, which extended French citizenship to European settlers and Algerian Jews whereas Muslim Algerians would be governed by Muslim law and restricted to a second-class citizenship.
