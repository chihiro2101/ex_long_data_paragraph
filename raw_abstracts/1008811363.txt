Alexander Yaroslavich Nevsky ; ; 13 May 1221<ref name="rozhdenia"></ref> &ndash; 14 November 1263), or Alexander Nevskii, served as Prince of Novgorod (1236–40, 1241–56 and 1258-1259), Grand Prince of Kiev (1236–52) and Grand Prince of Vladimir (1252–63) during some of the most difficult times in Kievan Rus' history.
Commonly regarded as a key figure of Kievan Rus', Alexander – a grandson of Vsevolod the Big Nest – rose to legendary status on account of his military victories over German and Swedish invaders. He preserved Russian statehood and Russian Orthodoxy, agreeing to pay tribute to the powerful Golden Horde. Metropolite Macarius canonized Alexander Nevsky as a saint of the Russian Orthodox Church in 1547.<ref>
