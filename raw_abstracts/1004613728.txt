Though superficially resembling the venomous copperhead and often killed as a result of this mistaken identity, corn snakes lack functional venom and are harmless and beneficial to humans <ref></ref> by helping to control populations of wild rodent pests that damage crops and spread disease.<ref></ref> Their docile nature, reluctance to bite, moderate adult size, attractive pattern, and comparatively simple care make them commonly kept pet snakes.
The corn snake is named for the species' regular presence near grain stores, where it preys on mice and rats that eat harvested corn.<ref></ref> The Oxford English Dictionary cites this usage as far back as 1675. Some sources maintain that the corn snake is so-named because the distinctive, nearly-checkered pattern of the snake's belly scales resembles the kernels of variegated corn.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Regardless of the name's origin, the corn reference can be a useful mnemonic for identifying corn snakes.
