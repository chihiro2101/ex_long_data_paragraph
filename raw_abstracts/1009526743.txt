Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a genetic disorder in which the electrical activity within the heart is abnormal.<ref name=Pol2017></ref> It increases the risk of Heart arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death.<ref name=Pol2017/> Those affected may have episodes of passing out.<ref name=Pol2017/> The abnormal heart rhythms seen in those with Brugada syndrome often occur at rest.<ref name=GHR2015/><ref name=Sar2016/> They may be triggered by a fever.<ref name=GHR2015></ref><ref name=Sar2016></ref>
About a quarter of those with Brugada syndrome have a family member who also has the condition.<ref name=Pol2017/> Some cases may be due to a new genetic mutation or certain medications.<ref name=GHR2015/> The most commonly involved gene is SCN5A which encodes the cardiac sodium channel.<ref name=Ant2016></ref> Diagnosis is typically by electrocardiogram (ECG), however, the abnormalities may not be consistently present.<ref name=Pol2017/> Medications such as ajmaline may be used to reveal the ECG changes.<ref name=Pol2017/> Similar ECG patterns may be seen in certain electrolyte imbalance or when the Ischemia.<ref name=Ant2013></ref>
There is no cure for Brugada syndrome.<ref name=NORD2016/> Those at higher risk of sudden cardiac death may be treated using an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).<ref name=NIH2017></ref> In those without symptoms the risk of death is much lower, and how to treat this group is less clear.<ref name=NORD2016/><ref name=Pri2013></ref> Isoproterenol may be used in the short term for those who have frequent life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms, while quinidine may be used longer term.<ref name=NORD2016></ref><ref name=Bel2004></ref> Testing people's family members may be recommended.<ref name=NORD2016/>
The condition affects between 1 and 30 per 10,000 people.<ref name=Pol2017/> It is more common in males than females and in those of Asian descent.<ref name=GHR2015/><ref name=Pol2017/> The onset of symptoms is usually in adulthood.<ref name=Pol2017/> It is named after the Catalan cardiologists Pedro and Josep Brugada who described the condition in 1992.<ref name=NORD2016/><ref name=Brug1992></ref> Their brother Ramon Brugada was the first to describe one potential genetic cause in 1998.<ref name=Brug2016></ref>
