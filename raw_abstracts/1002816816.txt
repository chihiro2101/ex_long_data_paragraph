Medium frequency (MF) is the ITU designation<ref name="ITU Nomenclature"></ref> for Radio frequency (RF) in the range of 300&nbsp;kilohertz (kHz) to 3&nbsp;megahertz (MHz). Part of this band is the medium wave&nbsp;(MW) AM broadcast band. The MF band is also known as the hectometer band as the wavelengths range from ten to one hectometer (1000 to 100&nbsp;m). Frequencies immediately below MF are denoted low frequency (LF), while the first band of higher frequencies is known as high frequency (HF). MF is mostly used for AM radio, Radio beacon, maritime ship-to-shore communication, and transoceanic air traffic control.
