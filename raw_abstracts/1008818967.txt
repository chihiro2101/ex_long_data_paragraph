A video rental shop/store is a physical retail business that rents home videos such as movies, prerecorded TV shows, video game discs and other content. Typically, a rental shop conducts business with customers under conditions and terms agreed upon in a rental agreement or contract, which may be implied, explicit, or written. Many video rental stores also sell previously-viewed movies and/or new unopened movies. 
In the 1980s, video rental stores rented VHS and Betamax tapes of movies, although most stores dropped Beta tapes when VHS won the format war late in the decade. In the 2000s, video rental stores began renting DVDs, a digital format with higher resolution than VHS. In the 2000s, stores began selling and renting Blu-ray discs, a format that supports High Definition.
Widespread adoption of video on demand and video streaming services such as Netflix in the 2010s sharply reduced most major rental chains' revenue, leading to the closure of many locations. Due to significantly less demand, few rental shops have survived into the present day.
