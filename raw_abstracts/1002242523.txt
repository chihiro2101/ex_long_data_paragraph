was a small ancient Greek Hellenistic city in the historic Caria cultural region of western Anatolia, Turkey. It is located near the modern village of Geyre, about east/inland from the coast of the Aegean Sea, and southeast of İzmir.
Aphrodisias was named after Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, who had here her unique cult image, the Aphrodite of Aphrodisias. According to the Suda, a Byzantine encyclopedic compilation, before the city became known as Aphrodisias (c.3rd century BCE) it had three previous names: Lelégōn Pólis (Λελέγων πόλις, "City of the Leleges"),<ref>For Greeks, "Leleges" denoted an ancient pre-Greek people.</ref> Megálē Pólis (Μεγάλη Πόλις, "Great City"), and Ninóē (Νινόη).<ref>See Suda Online s.v. Ninoe, urltoken (accessed 25-12-2006); the elite of Aphrodisias linked their founding to the Assyrian ruler called in Greek Ninus, the eponymous founder also of Nineveh.</ref>
Sometime before 640, in the Late Antiquity period when it was within the Byzantine Empire, the city was renamed Stauroúpolis (Σταυρούπολις, "City of the Cross").<ref name="cath">Siméon Vailhé, "Stauropolis" The Catholic Encyclopedia, 1912 urltoken full text, citing Heinrich Gelzer, Ungedruckte .
