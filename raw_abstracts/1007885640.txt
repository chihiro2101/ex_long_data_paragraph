The STEN (or Sten gun) is a family of British submachine guns chambered in 9×19mm and was used extensively by Commonwealth of Nations forces throughout World War II and the Korean War. They had a simple design and very low production cost, making them effective insurgency weapons for resistance groups, and they continue to see usage to this day by irregular military forces. The STEN served as the basis for the Sterling submachine gun, which replaced the STEN in British service until the 1980s, when it, and all other submachine guns, were replaced by the SA80.
The STEN is a select fire, blowback-operated weapon and loads its magazine on the left, rather than the bottom, as is the usual configuration.
STEN is an acronym, from the names of the weapon's chief designers, Major Reginald V. Shepherd and Harold Turpin, and EN for the Enfield factory.<ref> urltoken : Model Engineer Volume 88 Issue 2195 P.509 The STEN Carbine, A Description</ref><ref>Not all sources agree. Colonel Shepherd discussing how it was named when he received an Award from the Board of the Royal Commission Awards to Inventors.
Lord Cohen: "Why was it called the Sten?"
Colonel Shepard: "It was called the Sten by the then Director General of Artillery. The S was from my name, the T from Mr. Turpin who was my draughtsman and who did a very large amount of the design and the EN was for England. That is the origin of the name, for which I accept no responsibility." In: In the official history of the Royal Ordnance Factories, ST is for Shepard and Turpin and EN is for Enfield.

Over four million Stens in various versions were made in the 1940s, making it the second most produced submachine gun of the Second World War, after the Soviet PPSh-41.
