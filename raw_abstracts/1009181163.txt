The Head of State of Mexico is the person who controls the executive power in the country. Under the current constitution, this responsibility lies with the President of Mexico, who is head of the supreme executive power of the Mexican Union.<ref></ref> Throughout its history, Mexico has had several forms of government. Under the federal constitutions, the title of President was the same as the current one. Under the Seven Laws (centralism), the chief executive was named President of the Republic. In addition, there have been two periods of monarchical rule, during which the executive was controlled by the Emperor of Mexico.
The chronology of the heads of state of Mexico is complicated due to the country's political instability during most of the nineteenth century and early decades of the twentieth century. With few exceptions, most of the Mexican presidents elected during this period did not complete their terms. Until the presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas, each president had remained in office an average of fifteen months.<ref>Iturriaga, XXXX: 61.</ref>
