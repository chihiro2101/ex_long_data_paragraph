CBS Morning News is an American early-morning news broadcast presented weekdays on the CBS television network. The program features late-breaking news stories, national weather forecasts and sports highlights. Since 2013, it has been news presenter by Anne-Marie Green, who concurrently anchored the CBS late-night news program Up to the Minute until its cancellation in September 2015.
The program is broadcast live at 4:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time Zone (airing in the early timeslot to accommodate CBS stations that start their local news breakfast television at 4:30&nbsp;a.m.), and is transmitted in a continuous half-hour broadcast delay loop until 10:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time, when CBS This Morning begins in the Pacific Time Zone. The program usually airs as a lead-in to local morning newscasts on most CBS stations, although in the few markets where a morning newscast is not produced by the CBS station, it may air in a two- to three-hour loop immediately before the start of CBS This Morning. The show is updated for any breaking news occurring before 7:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time, while stations throughout the network will join CBS This Morning in all time zones past that time at their local discretion or network orders for live coverage.
