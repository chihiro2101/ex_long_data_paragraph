According to a press report about Project Slammer and Congressional oversight of counterespionage, one fairly basic function is observing one's own personnel for behavior that either suggests that they could be targets for foreign HUMINT, or may already have been subverted. News reports indicate that in hindsight, red flags were flying but not noticed.<ref name=Stein></ref> In several major penetrations of US services, such as Aldrich Ames, the Walker ring or Robert Hanssen, the individual showed patterns of spending inconsistent with their salary. Some people with changed spending may have a perfectly good reason, such as an inheritance or even winning the lottery, but such patterns should not be ignored.
Personnel in sensitive positions, who have difficulty getting along with peers, may become risks for being compromised with an approach based on ego. William Kampiles, a low-level worker in the CIA Watch Center, sold, for a small sum, the critical operations manual on the KH-11 reconnaissance satellite. To an interviewer, Kampiles suggested that if someone had noted his "problem"&mdash;constant conflicts with supervisors and co-workers&mdash;and brought in outside counseling, he might not have stolen the KH-11 manual.<ref name="Stein"/>
By 1997, the Project Slammer work was being presented at public meetings of the Security Policy Advisory Board.<ref name=SPAB1997></ref> While a funding cut caused the loss of impetus in the mid-nineties, there are research data used throughout the security community. They emphasize the <blockquote>essential and multi-faceted motivational patterns underlying espionage. Future Slammer analyses will focus on newly developing issues in espionage such as the role of money, the new dimensions of loyalty and what seems to be a developing trend toward economic espionage.</blockquote>
