Edible mushrooms are the fleshy and Eating fruit bodies of several species of macrofungi (fungi which bear fruiting structures that are large enough to be seen with the naked eye). They can appear either below ground (hypogeous) or above ground (epigeous) where they may be picked by hand.<ref name=def></ref> Edibility may be defined by criteria that include absence of poisonous effects on humans and desirable taste and aroma.<ref name="Mattila et al"></ref>
Edible mushrooms are consumed for their nutritional and cuisine value. Mushrooms, especially dried shiitake, are sources of umami flavor from guanylate.<ref></ref>
Mushrooms consumed by those practicing folk medicine are known as Medicinal fungi. While psychedelic mushrooms are occasionally consumed for recreational or entheogenic purposes, they can produce psychological effects, and are therefore not commonly used as food.<ref name=Boa2004></ref> While there is no evidence (as of 2019) from high-quality clinical research that "medicinal" mushrooms have an effect on human diseases<ref name="mlp2019"></ref><ref name="Money"></ref>, a number of potential medicinal effects have been shown in non-clinical studies <ref> urltoken 
Edible mushrooms include many fungal species that are either harvested wild or cultivated. Easily cultivated and common wild mushrooms are often available in markets, and those that are more difficult to obtain (such as the prized truffle, matsutake and morel) may be collected on a smaller scale by private gatherers. Some preparations may render certain mushroom poisoning fit for consumption.
Before assuming that any wild mushroom is edible, it should be identified. Accurate determination and proper identification of a species is the only safe way to ensure edibility, and the only safeguard against possible accident. Some mushrooms that are edible for most people can cause allergic reactions in some individuals, and old or improperly stored specimens can cause food poisoning. Great care should therefore be taken when eating any fungus for the first time, and only small quantities should be consumed in case of individual allergies. Deadly poisonous mushrooms that are frequently confused with edible mushrooms and responsible for many fatal poisonings include several species of the genus Amanita, in particular, Amanita phalloides, the death cap. It is therefore better to eat only a few, easily recognizable species, than to experiment indiscriminately. Moreover, even normally edible species of mushrooms may be dangerous, as mushrooms growing in polluted locations can accumulate pollutants such as heavy metals.<ref name=kalac00></ref>
