Media literacy encompasses the practices that allow people to access, critically evaluate, and create or manipulate media. Media literacy is not restricted to one medium.<ref></ref> The oldest organization studying Media Literacy is the National Telemedia Council based in Madison Wisconsin and led by Marieli Rowe for over 50 years. The NTC has published the Journal of Media Literacy during most of that history originally known as “Telemedium.”
Media literacy education is intended to promote awareness of media influence and create an active stance towards both consuming and creating media.<ref></ref> Media literacy education is part of the curriculum in the United States and some European Union countries, and an interdisciplinary global community of media scholars and educators engages in knowledge sharing through scholarly and professional journals and national membership associations.<ref></ref>
