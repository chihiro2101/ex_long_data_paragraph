Edmund Bonner (also Boner;<ref></ref> c. 15005 September 1569) was Bishop of London from 1539â€“49 and again from 1553-59.
Initially an instrumental figure in the schism of Henry VIII from Rome, he was antagonized by the Protestant reforms introduced by Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset and reconciled himself to Catholicism. He became notorious as "Bloody Bonner" for his role in the persecution of heresy under the Catholic government of Mary I of England, and ended his life as a prisoner under Queen Elizabeth.
