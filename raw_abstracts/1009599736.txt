The head louse (Pediculus humanus capitis) is an obligate parasitism of humans. <ref name="Buxton3"></ref>
Head lice are wingless insects that spend their entire lives on the human scalp and feeding exclusively on human blood.<ref name="Buxton3" /> Humans are the only known hosts of this specific parasite, while chimpanzees host a closely related species, Pediculus schaeffi. Other species of lice infest most orders of mammals and all orders of birds.
Lice differ from other hematophagic ectoparasites such as fleas in spending their entire lifecycle on a host.<ref name="maunder"></ref> Head lice cannot fly, and their short, stumpy legs render them incapable of jumping, or even walking efficiently on flat surfaces.<ref name="maunder"/>
The non-disease-carrying head louse differs from the related disease-carrying body louse (Pediculus humanus humanus) in preferring to attach eggs to scalp hair rather than to clothing. The two subspecies are morphologically almost identical, but do not normally interbreed. From genetic studies, they are thought to have diverged as subspecies about 30,000â€“110,000 years ago, when many humans began to wear a significant amount of clothing.<ref></ref><ref name="Stoneking"></ref> A much more distantly related species of hair-clinging louse, the pubic or crab louse (Pthirus pubis), also infests humans. It is morphologically different from the other two species and is much closer in appearance to the lice which infest other primates.<ref name="Buxton6"></ref> Louse infestation of the body is known as pediculosis. pediculosis capitis for head lice, pediculosis corporis for body lice, and phthiriasis for pubic lice.<ref name="urlpediculosis - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary"></ref>
Head lice (especially in children) have been, and still are, subject to various eradication campaigns. Unlike body lice, head lice are not the vectors of any known diseases. Except for rare secondary infections that result from scratching at bites, head lice are harmless, and they have been regarded by some as essentially a psychological/emotional rather than a medical problem. Head louse infestations may be beneficial in helping to foster a natural immune response against lice which helps humans in defense against the far more dangerous body louse, which is capable of transmitting dangerous diseases.<ref name="mutualism"></ref>
