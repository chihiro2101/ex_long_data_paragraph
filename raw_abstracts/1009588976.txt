Tumor necrosis factor (TNF, cachexin, or cachectin; often called tumor necrosis factor alpha or TNF-α) is a cytokine, i.e. a small protein used by the immune system for cell signaling. If macrophages (certain white blood cells) detect an infection, they release TNF in order to alert other cells of the immune system as well as cells of other tissues, leading to inflammation. TNF is a member of the TNF superfamily, which consists of various transmembrane proteins with a homologous TNF domain. 
 
TNF signaling occurs through two receptors: TNFR1 and TNFR2.<ref name="pmid33192311"></ref><ref name="pmid33324405"></ref> TNFR1 is constituitively expressed on most cell types, whereas TNRF2 is restricted primarily to endothelial, epithelial, and subsets of immune cells.<ref name="pmid33192311" /><ref name="pmid33324405"/> TNF1 signaling tends to be pro-inflammatory and apoptosis, whereas TNFR2 signaling is anti-inflammatory and promotes cell proliferation.<ref name="pmid33192311" /><ref name="pmid33324405"/> Suppression of TNFR1 signaling has been important for treatment of autoimmune disease,<ref name="pmid33053859"></ref> whereas TNFR2 signaling promotes wound healing.<ref name="pmid33324405"/>
TNF-α exists as a transmembrane form (mTNF-α) and as a soluble form (sTNF-α). sTNF-α results from enzymatic cleavage of mTNF-α.<ref name="pmid29234328"></ref> mTNF-α is mainly found on monocytes/macrophages where it interacts with tissue receptors by cell-to-cell contact.<ref name="pmid29234328" /> sTNF-α selectively binds to TNFR1, whereas mTNF-α binds to both TNFR1 and TNFR2.<ref name="pmid26117714"></ref> TNF-α binding to TNFR1 is irreversible, whereas binding to TNFR2 is reversible.<ref name="pmid27888159"></ref>
The primary role of TNF is in the regulation of immune cells. TNF, being an Fever#Endogenous, is able to induce fever, apoptosis, cachexia, inflammation and to inhibit tumorigenesis, viral replication, and respond to sepsis via IL-1 and IL-6-producing cells. Dysregulation of TNF production has been implicated in a variety of human diseases including Alzheimer's disease,<ref name="pmid20692646"></ref> cancer,<ref name="pmid11239407"></ref> major depression,<ref name="pmid20015486"></ref> psoriasis<ref name="pmid12851985"></ref> and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).<ref name="pmid12077089"></ref> Though controversial, some studies have linked depression and IBD to increased levels of TNF.<ref name="pmid17206706"></ref><ref name="pmid27991935"></ref>
Under the name tasonermin, TNF is used as an immunostimulant in the treatment of certain cancers. Drugs that counter the action of TNF are used in the treatment of various inflammatory diseases, for instance rheumatoid arthritis.
Certain cancers can cause overproduction of TNF. TNF parallels parathyroid hormone both in causing secondary hypercalcemia and in the cancers with which excessive production is associated.
