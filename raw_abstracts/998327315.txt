The development of the nervous system, or neural development, or neurodevelopment, refers to the processes that generate, shape, and reshape the nervous system of animals, from the earliest stages of embryonic development to adulthood. The field of neural development draws on both neuroscience and developmental biology to describe and provide insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which complex nervous systems develop, from nematodes and fruit flies to mammals. 
Defects in neural development can lead to malformations such as holoprosencephaly, and a wide variety of neurological disorders including paresis and paralysis, balance and vision disorders, and seizures,<ref name="Vet"></ref> and in humans other disorders such as Rett syndrome, Down syndrome and intellectual disability.<ref></ref>
