Ridicule is a 1996 French historical drama directed by Patrice Leconte and starring Charles Berling, Jean Rochefort, Fanny Ardant and Judith Godr√®che. Set in the 18th century at the decadent court of Versailles, where social status can rise and fall based on one's ability to mete out witty insults and avoid ridicule oneself, the film's plot examines the social injustices of late 18th-century France, in showing the corruption and callousness of the aristocrats.
