Udon is a thick noodle made from wheat flour, used in Japanese cuisine. Its simplest form is in a hot soup as kake udon with a mild broth called kakejiru made from dashi, soy sauce, and mirin. It is usually topped with thinly chopped Scallion. Other common toppings include prawn tempura, kakiage (mixed tempura fritter), abura-age (sweet, deep-fried tofu pouches), kamaboko (sliced fish cake), and shichimi spice added to taste.
Standard broth differs by region. Dark (koikuchi) soy sauce is added in eastern Japan, while light (usukuchi) soy sauce is added in the west. Notably, instant noodles are often sold in two versions accordingly.
More unusual variants include stir-fried yaki udon and curry udon made with Japanese curry.
