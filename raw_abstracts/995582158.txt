In chemistry, a leaving group is a molecular fragment that departs with a pair of electrons in heterolysis (chemistry). Leaving groups can be anions, cations or neutral molecules, but in either case it is crucial that the leaving group be able to stabilize the additional electron density that results from bond heterolysis. Common anionic leaving groups are halides such as Cl<sup>−</sup>, Br<sup>−</sup>, and I<sup>−</sup>, and sulfonate esters such as tosylate (TsO<sup>−</sup>). Fluoride (F<sup>−</sup>) functions as a leaving group in the nerve agent sarin gas. Common neutral molecule leaving groups are water and ammonia. Leaving groups may also be positively charged cations (such as H<sup>+</sup> released during the nitration of benzene); these are also known specifically as electrofuges.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
