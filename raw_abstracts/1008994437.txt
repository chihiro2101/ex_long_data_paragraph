Survivalism is a social movement of individuals or groups (called survivalists or preppers<ref name="NYT-20200424" /><ref name="Senekal 2019"></ref>) who actively prepare for emergencies, including possible disruptions in social or political order, on scales from local to international. Survivalism also encompasses preparation for personal emergencies, such as job loss or being stranded in the wild or under adverse weather conditions. The emphasis is on self-reliance, stockpiling supplies, and gaining survival knowledge and skills. Survivalists often acquire emergency medical and self-defense training, stockpile food and water, prepare to become self-sufficient, and build structures such as survival retreats or blast shelters that may help them survive a catastrophe.
Use of the term survivalist dates from the early 1980.<ref></ref>
