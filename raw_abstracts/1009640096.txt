The "Te Deum" , ; from its incipit, , is a Latin Christian hymn traditionally ascribed to AD&nbsp;387 authorship, but with antecedents that place it much earlier.<ref></ref> It is central to the Ambrosian hymns, which spread throughout the Latin Church with other parts of the Milanese Rite in the 6th to 8th centuries. It is sometimes known as the "Ambrosian Hymn", although authorship by Saint Ambrose is unlikely. The term "Te Deum" can also refer to a short religious service (of blessing or thanks) based upon the hymn.<ref name=service></ref>
