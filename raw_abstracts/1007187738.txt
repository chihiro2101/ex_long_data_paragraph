A favela is a type of low-income slum in Brazil that has experienced historical governmental neglect. The first favela, now known as ProvidÃªncia in the center of Rio de Janeiro, appeared in the late 19th century, built by soldiers who had nowhere to live following the Canudos War. Some of the first settlements were called bairros africanos (African neighborhoods). Over the years, many former Slavery in Brazil moved in. Even before the first favela came into being, poor citizens were pushed away from the city and forced to live in the far suburbs. Most modern favelas appeared in the 1970s due to Rural flight, when many people left rural areas of Brazil and moved to cities. Unable to find places to live, many people found themselves in favelas.<ref> urltoken Darcy Ribeiro, O Povo Brasileiro .
