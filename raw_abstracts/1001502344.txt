The naginata , is a pole weapon and one of several varieties of traditionally made Japanese blades (nihonto).<ref></ref><ref></ref> Naginata were originally used by the samurai class of feudal Japan, as well as by ashigaru (foot soldiers) and sōhei (warrior monks).<ref name="books.google.com"></ref> The naginata is the iconic weapon of the onna-bugeisha, a type of female warrior belonging to the Japanese nobility.
Naginata for fighting men and warrior monks were ō-naginata. The kind used by women was called ko-naginata. Since the naginata with its pole is heavier and much slower than the Japanese sword, the blade of the ko-naginata was smaller than the male warrior's ō-naginata in order to compensate for the lesser height and upper body strength of a woman than an armoured male samurai.
