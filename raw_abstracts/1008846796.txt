The entirety of Cocos Island has been designated a Costa Rican National Park since 1978, and has no permanent inhabitants other than Costa Rican park rangers. Surrounded by deep waters with counter-currents, Cocos Island is admired by scuba divers for its populations of hammerhead sharks, rays, dolphins and other large marine species. The wet climate and oceanic qualities give Cocos an ecological character that is not shared with either the Galápagos Islands or any of the other islands (for example, Malpelo, Gorgona or Coiba) in the eastern Pacific Ocean.<ref>Kirkendall, L. and Jordal, B. 2006.
