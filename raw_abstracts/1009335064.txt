Hair removal, also known as epilation or depilation, is the deliberate removal of body hair.
Hair typically grows all over the human body. Hair can become more visible during and after puberty and men tend to have thicker, more visible body hair than women.<ref name="Shellow">Shellow, Victoria (2006) Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History, Greenwood Publishing Group. p.67. </ref>
Both men and women have visible hair on the Hair, eyebrows, eyelashes, armpits, pubic hair, arms, and legs; men and some women also have thicker hair on their face, abdomen, back and chest. Hair does not generally grow on the lips, the underside of the hands or foot or on certain areas of the genitalia.
Hair removal may be practised for cultural, aesthetic, hygiene, sexual, medical or religious reasons. Forms of hair removal have been practised in almost all human cultures since at least the Neolithic era. The methods used to remove hair have varied in different times and regions, but shaving is the most common method.
