A period&nbsp;1 element is one of the chemical elements in the first row (or period) of the periodic table. The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate periodic (recurring) trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat, meaning that analog elements fall into the same vertical columns. The first period contains fewer elements than any other row in the table, with only two: hydrogen and helium. This situation can be explained by modern theories of atomic structure. In a quantum mechanics description of atomic structure, this period corresponds to the filling of the 1s orbital. Period&nbsp;1 elements obey the duet rule in that they need two electrons to complete their valence shell.
Hydrogen and helium are the oldest and the most abundant elements in the universe.
