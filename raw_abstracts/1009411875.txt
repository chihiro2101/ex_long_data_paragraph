Ethiopian music is a term that can mean any music of Ethiopian origin, however, often it is applied to a genre, a distinct Musical mode that is pentatonic, with characteristically long intervals between some notes.
The music of the Ethiopian Highlands uses a fundamental modal system called qenet, of which there are four main modes: tezeta, bati, ambassel, and anchihoy.<ref name=Grove356></ref> Three additional modes are variations on the above: tezeta minor, bati major, and bati minor.<ref name=":0"></ref><ref name="Barihun">Abatte Barihun, liner notes of the album Ras Deshen, 200.</ref><ref></ref> Some songs take the name of their qenet, such as tizita, a song of reminiscence.<ref name=Grove356 /> When played on traditional instruments, these modes are generally not tempered (that is, the pitches may deviate slightly from the Western-tempered tuning system), but when played on Western instruments such as pianos and guitars, they are played using the Western-tempered tuning system.
