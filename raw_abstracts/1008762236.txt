Jafar is a Character (arts) in Walt Disney Pictures' 31st animated feature film Aladdin (1992). He is voiced by American actor Jonathan Freeman, who also portrayed the character in the Aladdin (2011 musical). Jafar also appears in the 1994 sequel to Aladdin, but he is not in the 1996 third film or the TV series.
An inspiration to the character is the villain Jafar, played by Conrad Veidt in The Thief of Bagdad, from which Aladdin borrows several character ideas and plot elements. The Jafar of Disney's Aladdin plays essentially the same part as the character from the 1940 film, and is drawn with notable similarity to Veidt's looks.<ref name="fosteronfilm1"></ref> He is loosely based on the real-life Persian Abbasid vizier Ja'far ibn Yahya.<ref></ref>
