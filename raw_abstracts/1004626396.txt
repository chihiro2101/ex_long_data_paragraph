The Goldbergs is a comedy-drama broadcast from 1929 to 1946 on American radio, and from 1949 to 1956 on American television. It was adapted into a 1948 play, Me and Molly; a 1950 film The Goldbergs, and a 1973 Broadway musical, Molly. It also spun off briefly a comic strip from June 8, 1944 to December 21, 1945 with art by Irving Hasen, an artist at that time who worked in comic books especially on various titles published by DC comics. He would later do the Dondi comic strip.
