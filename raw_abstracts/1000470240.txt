The Nauvoo Expositor was a newspaper in Nauvoo, Illinois, that published only one issue, on June 7, 1844. Its publication, and the destruction of the printing press ordered by Joseph Smith, set off a chain of events that led to Smith's death.
The Expositor was founded by several seceders from the Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints) and some non-Mormons in the Nauvoo area. The single edition of the newspaper was critical of Smith and other church leaders. Specifically, Smith was criticized for teaching doctrines such as plural marriage and exaltation (plurality of gods).<ref name="96Trib"> urltoken "Polygamy, Persecution And Power", The Salt Lake Tribune, June 16, 1996, paragraph 16, 17</ref>
In response to the newspaper's publication, Smith and the Nauvoo City Council declared the paper a public nuisance, and ordered the press destroyed.<ref name="historyOfLDS-council"> urltoken History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints volume VI (1912), pp. 430-432.

The destruction of the press led to charges of riot against Smith and other members of the Council. After Smith surrendered on the charges, he was also charged with treason against Illinois. Smith was killed by a mob while awaiting a trial in Carthage Jail.
