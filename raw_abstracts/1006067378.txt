In 1969 at a UNESCO Conference in San Francisco, peace activist John McConnell proposed a day to honor the Earth and the concept of peace, to first be celebrated on March 21, 1970, the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere. This day of nature's equipoise was later sanctioned in a proclamation written by McConnell and signed by Secretary General U Thant at the United Nations. A month later the United States Senator Gaylord Nelson proposed the idea to hold a nationwide environmental teach-in on April 22, 1970. He hired a young activist, Denis Hayes, to be the National Coordinator. Nelson and Hayes renamed the event "Earth Day". Under the leadership of labor leader Walter Reuther, the United Auto Workers was the most instrumental outside financial and operational supporter of the first Earth Day.<ref name="grist.org"></ref><ref name="time.com"></ref><ref name="therumpus.net"></ref> According to Hayes, "Without the UAW, the first Earth Day would have likely flopped!"<ref name="grist.org"/> Nelson was later awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom award in recognition of his work.<ref></ref> The first Earth Day was focused on the United States.
