In combinatorics, Ramsey's theorem, in one of its Graph theory forms, states that one will find monochromatic cliques in any graph labeling (with colours) of a sufficiently large complete graph. To demonstrate the theorem for two colours (say, blue and red), let r and s be any two positive integers.<ref>Some authors restrict the values to be greater than one, for example and , thus avoiding a discussion of edge colouring a graph with no edges, while others rephrase the statement of the theorem to require, in a simple graph, either an r-clique or an s-independent set, see or . In this form, the consideration of graphs with one vertex is more natural.</ref> Ramsey's theorem states that there exists a least positive integer for which every blue-red edge colouring of the complete graph on vertices contains a blue clique on r vertices or a red clique on s vertices. (Here signifies an integer that depends on both r and s.)
Ramsey's theorem is a foundational result in combinatorics. The first version of this result was proved by F. P. Ramsey. This initiated the combinatorial theory now called Ramsey theory, that seeks regularity amid disorder: general conditions for the existence of substructures with regular properties. In this application it is a question of the existence of monochromatic subsets, that is, subsets of connected edges of just one colour.
An extension of this theorem applies to any finite number of colours, rather than just two. More precisely, the theorem states that for any given number of colours, c, and any given integers n<sub>1</sub>, …, n<sub>c</sub>, there is a number, R(n<sub>1</sub>, …, n<sub>c</sub>), such that if the edges of a complete graph of order R(n<sub>1</sub>, ., n<sub>c</sub>) are coloured with c different colours, then for some i between 1 and c, it must contain a complete subgraph of order n<sub>i</sub> whose edges are all colour i. The special case above has c&thinsp;=&thinsp;2 (and n<sub>1</sub>&thinsp;=&thinsp;r and n<sub>2</sub>&thinsp;=&thinsp;s).
