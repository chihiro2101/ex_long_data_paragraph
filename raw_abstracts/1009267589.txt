The word Muzak has been a registered trademark since December 21, 1954, of Muzak LLC,<ref name="A1"></ref> although it dominated the market for so many years that the term is often used (especially when used with lowercase spelling) as a generic term for all background music.<ref name="A2"></ref> The term Muzak is – at least in the United States – often used as a term for most forms of background music, regardless of the source of the music, and may also be known as "elevator music" or "lift music". Though Muzak Holdings was for many years the best-known supplier of background music, and is commonly associated with elevator music, the company itself did not supply music to elevators.<ref></ref> Since 1997, Muzak has used original artists for its music source,<ref></ref> except on the Environmental channel.<ref> (PDF)</ref>
