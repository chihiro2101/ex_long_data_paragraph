Top Fuel dragsters are the quickest accelerating racing cars in the world and the fastest sanctioned category of drag racing, with the fastest competitors reaching speeds of and finishing the runs in 3.62 seconds.
A top fuel dragster accelerates from a standstill to in as little as 0.8 seconds (less than one third the time required by a production Porsche 911 Turbo to reach <ref></ref> and can exceed in just . This subjects the driver to an average acceleration of about over the duration of the race and with a peak of over .
Because of the speeds, this class exclusively races to only a distance, and not the traditional one-fourth of a statute mile, or . The rule was changed in 2008 by the National Hot Rod Association following the fatal crash of Funny Car driver Scott Kalitta during a qualifying session at Old Bridge Township Raceway Park in Englishtown, New Jersey. The shortening of the distance was used by the FIA at some tracks, and as of 2012 is now the standard Top Fuel distance defined by the FIA. The International Hot Rod Association, which now sanctions Top Fuel in Australia, dropped the 1/4 mile distance in September 2017 after Santo Rapisarda, a car owner who often runs NHRA races in the United States, pushed for the change. In recent years, only exhibition races in Martin, Michigan's, US 131 Motorsports Park are run as Top Fuel races to the quarter-mile.
