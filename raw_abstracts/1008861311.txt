Laguna de Báý ; or Báý Lake (incorrectly called "Laguna lake") is the largest lake in the Philippines. It is located southeast of Metro Manila, between the provinces of Laguna to the south and Rizal to the north. A freshwater lake, it has a surface area of 911–949&nbsp;km² (352–366 sq mi), with an average depth of about and an elevation of about above sea level. The lake is shaped like a stylized 'W', with two peninsulas jutting out from the northern shore. Between these peninsulas, the middle lobe fills the large volcanic Laguna Caldera. In the middle of the lake is the large island of Talim, which falls under the jurisdiction of the towns of Binangonan and Cardona in Rizal province.
The lake is one of the primary sources of freshwater fish in the country. Its water drains to Manila Bay via the Pasig River.
