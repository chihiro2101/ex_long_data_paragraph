The Human Potential Movement (HPM) arose out of the counterculture movement of the 1960s<ref></ref> and formed around the concept of cultivating extraordinary potential that its advocates believe to lie largely untapped in all people. The movement took as its premise the belief that through the development of "human potential", humans can experience an exceptional quality of life filled with happiness, creativity, and fulfillment. As a corollary, those who begin to unleash this assumed potential often find themselves directing their actions within society toward assisting others to release their potential. Adherents believe that the net effect of individuals cultivating their potential will bring about positive social change at large.
