The biological pump, also known as the marine carbon pump, is, in its simplest form, the ocean's biologically driven sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere and land runoff to the ocean interior and seafloor sediments.<ref name="Sigman DM 2006. pp. 491-528">Sigman DM & GH Haug. 2006. The biological pump in the past. In: Treatise on Geochemistry; vol. 6, (ed.). Pergamon Press, pp. 491-528</ref> It is the part of the oceanic carbon cycle responsible for the cycling of organic matter formed mainly by phytoplankton during photosynthesis (soft-tissue pump), as well as the cycling of calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) formed into shells by certain organisms such as plankton and mollusks (carbonate pump).<ref name="Hain et al 2014 ToG"></ref>
The biological pump is not so much the result of a single process, but rather the sum of a number of processes each of which can influence biological pumping.
