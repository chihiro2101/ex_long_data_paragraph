Madge Augustine Oberholtzer (November 10, 1896 &ndash; April 14, 1925) was a white American woman whose rape and murder played a critical role in the demise of the second incarnation of the Ku Klux Klan. In March 1925, while working for the state of Indiana on an adult literacy campaign, she was kidnapped by D. C. Stephenson, Grand Dragon of the Indiana Klan. Holding her captive in his private train car, he raped and tortured her. She died from a combination of a staphylococcal infection from her injuries and renal failure from mercury chloride poisoning, which she took while held captive in an attempt to commit suicide.<ref name="Linder"> urltoken Daniel O.

Following the suicide attempt, Stephenson's men returned Oberholtzer to her home, assuming her injuries would soon prove fatal and believing their influential leader was immune to any prosecution. However, his victim regained consciousness long enough to give a signed statement to police.<ref name=made5232 /> She described Stephenson's assaults which led to his conviction at trial and led to the rapid decline of KKK membership in Indiana.
