Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS), also known as Todd's syndrome or dysmetropsia, is a neuropsychological condition that causes a distortion of perception. People may experience distortions in visual perception of objects such as appearing smaller (micropsia) or larger (macropsia), or appearing to be closer (pelopsia) or farther (teleopsia) away than they actually are. Distortion may occur for other senses besides vision as well.
Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS) is often associated with migraines, brain tumors, or psychoactive drug. It can also be the initial symptom of the Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (see Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases).<ref></ref> AIWS can be caused by abnormal amounts of electrical activity resulting in abnormal blood flow in the parts of the brain that process visual perception and texture.<ref name="Feldman2008"></ref>
Anecdotal reports suggest that the symptoms of mononucleosis commonly occur as AIWS in childhood.<ref name="Lahat_1991"></ref>
