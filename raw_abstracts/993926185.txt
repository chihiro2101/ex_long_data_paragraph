A sheepdog trial (also herding event, stock dog trial or simply dog trial) is a competitive dog sport in which herding dogs move sheep around a field, fences, gates, or enclosures as directed by their handlers. Such events are particularly associated with hill farming areas, where sheep range widely on largely fence land. These trials take place in the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, Chile, Canada, the USA, Australia, New Zealand and other farming nations.
Some venues allow only dogs of known herding breeds to compete; others allow any dog that has been trained to work stock.
