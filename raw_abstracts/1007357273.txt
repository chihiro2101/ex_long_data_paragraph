The Himba (singular: OmuHimba, plural: OvaHimba) are indigenous peoples with an estimated population of about 50,000 people<ref name="METNG"></ref> living in northern Namibia, in the Kunene Region (formerly Kaokoland) and on the other side of the Cunene River in southern Angola.<ref name="METNG" /> There are also a few groups left of the OvaTwa, who are also OvaHimba, but are hunter-gatherers. However, the OvaHimba do not like to be associated with OvaTwa. Culturally distinguishable from the Herero people, the OvaHimba are a semi-nomadic, pastoralism people and speak OtjiHimba, a variety of Herero, which belongs to the Bantu family within Nigerâ€“Congo.<ref name="METNG" /> The OvaHimba are semi-nomadic as they have base homesteads where crops are cultivated, but may have to move within the year depending on rainfall and where there is access to water.
The OvaHimba are considered the last (semi-) nomadic people of Namibia.
