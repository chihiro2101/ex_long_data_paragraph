is a fictional character in Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series. He is a red anthropomorphic short-beaked echidna who is determined and serious, but sometimes gullible. He has the ability to glide and climb up walls, and is a powerful fighter with spiked hands. He serves as the guardian of the Master Emerald, a huge gemstone that controls the series' integral Chaos Emeralds, and is the last living member of his race.
Knuckles debuted in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 in 1994 after Doctor Eggman tricks him into opposing Sonic and Tails. He first became playable in Sonic & Knuckles later that year; he learns of Eggman's trickery and teams up with Sonic and Tails during that game's events. Since then he has appeared in dozens of playable and non-playable roles, as well as in several series of comic books, Western animated television, and Japanese anime.
Knuckles is one of the series' most popular characters, although some have voiced disapproval of the List of Sonic the Hedgehog characters and singled out Knuckles as ushering them in. More, fans have either derided or showed disappointment at how Knuckles's role in the series diminished as the series goes on, and even more did not appreciate how he was used as nothing more than comic relief.<ref></ref> His likeness has frequently appeared in Sonic merchandise.
