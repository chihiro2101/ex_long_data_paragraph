* Lemon-rumped warbler Phylloscopus chloronotus. Himalayas, southwest China. Three subspecies, P. c. chloronotus, P. c. forresti and P. c. simlaensis.
* Gansu leaf warbler Phylloscopus kansuensis. Central western China, monotypic.
* Chinese leaf warbler Phylloscopus yunnanensis (synonym P. sichuanensis). Western China, monotypic.
Of these, Phylloscopus chloronotus forresti is possibly also a separate species, but further analysis is required to confirm this. The breeding ranges of the Gansu leaf warbler and the Chinese leaf warbler overlap in southern Gansu, but the species are separated ecology: the Gansu leaf warbler is found in taller forest habitats and the Chinese leaf warbler uses lower, often scrubby habitats.<ref name="hbwonlinefam"/> "Lemon-rumped warbler" was sometimes used as synonym for Pallas's leaf warbler before the species' split.<ref name="bakerpallas"/> Pallas's leaf warbler appears to have diverged from the Chinese leaf warbler 4.1–5.5&nbsp;million years ago, and from its other former subspecies about 1.7–3.2&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name="martens"/>
