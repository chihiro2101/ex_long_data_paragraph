Aortic stenosis (AS or AoS) is the stenosis of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins), such that problems result.<ref name=Cz2014/> It may occur at the aortic valve as well as above and below this level.<ref name=Cz2014/> It typically gets worse over time.<ref name=Cz2014/> Symptoms often come on gradually with a decreased ability to exercise often occurring first.<ref name=Cz2014/> If heart failure, Syncope (medicine), or angina occur due to AS the outcomes are worse.<ref name=Cz2014/> Loss of consciousness typically occurs with standing or exercising.<ref name=Cz2014/> Signs of heart failure include shortness of breath especially when orthopnea, at night, or with exercise, and peripheral edema.<ref name=Cz2014/> Thickening of the valve without narrowing is known as aortic sclerosis.<ref name=Cz2014/>
Causes include being born with a bicuspid aortic valve, and rheumatic fever; a normal valve may also harden over the decades.<ref name=Cz2014/> A bicuspid aortic valve affects about one to two percent of the population.<ref name=Cz2014/> As of 2014 rheumatic heart disease mostly occurs in the developing world.<ref name=Cz2014/> Risk factors are similar to those of coronary artery disease and include smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, and being male.<ref name=Cz2014/> The aortic valve usually has three leaflets and is located between the left ventricle of the heart, and the aorta.<ref name=Cz2014/> AS typically results in a heart murmur.<ref name=Cz2014/> Its severity can be divided into mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, distinguishable by echocardiogram.<ref name=Cz2014/>
Aortic stenosis is typically followed using repeated ultrasound scans.<ref name=Cz2014/> Once it has become severe, treatment primarily involves valve replacement surgery, with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) being an option in some who are at high risk from surgery.<ref name=Cz2014/> Valves may either be mechanical or bioprosthetic, with each having risks and benefits.<ref name=Cz2014/> Another less invasive procedure, balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV), may result in benefit, but for only a few months.<ref name=Cz2014/> Complications such as heart failure may be treated in the same way as in those with mild to moderate AS.<ref name=Cz2014/> In those with severe disease a number of medications should be avoided, including ACE inhibitors, nitroglycerin, and some beta blockers.<ref name=Cz2014/> Nitroprusside or phenylephrine may be used in those with decompensated heart failure depending on the blood pressure.<ref name=Cz2014/><ref name=Over2008></ref>
Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease in the developed world.<ref name="Asymptomatic"></ref> It affects about 2% of people who are over 65 years of age.<ref name=Cz2014></ref> Estimated rates were not known in most of the developing world as of 2014.<ref></ref> In those who have symptoms, without repair the chance of death at five years is about 50% and at 10 years is about 90%.<ref name=Cz2014/> Aortic stenosis was first described by French physician Lazare Rivi√®re in 1663.<ref name="Cellular"></ref>
