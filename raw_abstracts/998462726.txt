In ethics and governance, accountability is answerability, blameworthiness, liability, and the expectation of account-giving.<ref></ref> As in an aspect of governance, it has been central to discussions related to problems in the public sector, nonprofit and private (corporate) and individual contexts. In leadership roles,<ref>Williams, Reyes(2006) Leadership accountability in a globalizing world. London: Palgrave Macmillan.</ref> accountability is the acknowledgment and assumption of responsibility for actions, products, decisions, and policies including the administration, governance, and implementation within the scope of the role or employment position and encompassing the obligation to report, explain and be answerable for resulting consequences.
In governance, accountability has expanded beyond the basic definition of "being called to account for one's actions".<ref></ref><ref></ref> It is frequently described as an account giving relationship between individuals, e.g. "A is accountable to B when A is obliged to inform B about A's (past or future) actions and decisions, to justify them, and to suffer punishment in the case of eventual misconduct"and more.<ref></ref> Accountability cannot exist without proper accounting practices; in other words, an absence of accounting means an absence of accountability. Another key area that contributes to accountability is good records management.<ref>David, R. (2017). Contribution of records management to audit opinions and accountability in government.
