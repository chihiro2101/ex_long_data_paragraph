The Information Awareness Office (IAO) was established by the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in January 2002 to bring together several DARPA projects focused on applying surveillance and information technology to track and monitor terrorists and other asymmetric warfare to U.S. national security by achieving "Total Information Awareness" (TIA).<ref></ref><ref name="jamespoulosforbes"/><ref name="sciamtia"/>
This was achieved by creating enormous computer databases to gather and store the personal information of everyone in the United States, including personal e-mails, social networks, credit card records, phone calls, medical records, and numerous other sources, without any requirement for a search warrant.<ref name="nytimes-markoff"></ref> This information was then analyzed to look for suspicious activities, connections between individuals, and "threats".<ref name="epic-tia-home"> urltoken Total Information Awareness (TIA), Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC)</ref> Additionally, the program included funding for biometric surveillance technologies that could identify and track individuals using surveillance cameras, and other methods.<ref name="epic-tia-home" />
Following public criticism that the development and deployment of this technology could potentially lead to a mass surveillance system, the IAO was defunded by Congress in 2003. However, several IAO projects continued to be funded and merely run under different names, as revealed by Edward Snowden during the course of the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures.<ref name="jamespoulosforbes"></ref><ref name="sciamtia"></ref><ref>Dismantling the Empire: America's Last Best Hope By Chalmers Johnson "Congress's action did not end the Total Information Awareness program.
