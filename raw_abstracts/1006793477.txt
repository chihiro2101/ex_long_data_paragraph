David John Lodge CBE (born 28 January 1935) is an English author and literary critic. A professor of English Literature at the University of Birmingham until 1987, he is known for novels that satirise academic life, notably the "Campus Trilogy" â€“ Changing Places: A Tale of Two Campuses (1975), Small World: An Academic Romance (1984) and Nice Work (1988). The second two were shortlisted for the Booker Prize. Another theme is Roman Catholicism, beginning from his first published novel The Picturegoers (1960). Lodge has also written television screenplays and three stage plays. Since retiring, he has continued to publish literary criticism, which often draws on his experience as a recipient novelist and scriptwriter.
