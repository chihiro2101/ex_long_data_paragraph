Chinook Jargon language use itself stretched from Alaska, the Yukon, and general British Columbia in the North (where it was spoken by the Haida, Sitka, Athabascans and likely others), down through Puget Sound and Oregon (where it was always at its strongest, as the original Chinook language originated and was in use along the Columbia River in Oregon and Washington), and in the southernmost areas it was in North California (spoken near Smith River and in Humboldt and Shasta counties at the least). In the east it stretched to Idaho and Montana (Rockies-Flathead).
