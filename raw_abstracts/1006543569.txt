"Red Hill Mining Town", by U2 is about the breakdown of relationships during the strike.
The storyline of Radio K.A.O.S., a 1987 album by Roger Waters, makes several references to the strike and its repercussions.
The strike saw the resurgence of traditional folk songs about coal mining. Dick Gaughan released a mixture of old and new songs on his LP True and Bold. An old Northumbrian folk song, "Blackleg Miner" gained attention when recorded by Steeleye Span in 1970 and was played to show support for the NUM and intimidate strikebreakers.<ref name="SteeleyeSpan"></ref>
The album Every Valley from Public Service Broadcasting is based on the history of the Mining in Wales, more specifically chronicling the rise and decline of the country's coal industry, the miners' strike plays a huge role on the album.<ref name="clashmusic-1"></ref>
