The Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation (S&SY) is a system of navigable inland waterways (canals and canalised rivers) in South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, England.
Chiefly based on the River Don, it runs for a length of and has 27 locks. It connects Sheffield, Rotherham, and Doncaster with the River Trent at Keadby and (via the New Junction Canal) the Aire and Calder Navigation.
The system consisted of five parts, four of which are still open to navigation today:-
* The River Don Navigation
* The Sheffield Canal (effectively abandoned in the early 1970s but revitalised since the 1990s)
* The Stainforth and Keadby Canal
* The New Junction Canal
* The Dearne and Dove Canal (closed 1961)
