Thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation generated by the thermal motion of particles in matter. All matter with a temperature greater than absolute zero emits thermal radiation. Particle motion results in charge-acceleration or dipole oscillation which produces electromagnetic radiation.
Infrared radiation emitted by animals (detectable with an infrared camera) and cosmic microwave background radiation are examples of thermal radiation.
If a radiation object meets the physical characteristics of a black body in thermodynamic equilibrium, the radiation is called blackbody radiation.<ref>K. Huang, Statistical Mechanics (2003), p.278</ref> Planck's law describes the spectrum of blackbody radiation, which depends solely on the object's temperature. Wien's displacement law determines the most likely frequency of the emitted radiation, and the Stefanâ€“Boltzmann law gives the radiant intensity.<ref>K. Huang, Statistical Mechanics (2003), p.280</ref>
Thermal radiation is also one of the fundamental mechanisms of heat transfer.
