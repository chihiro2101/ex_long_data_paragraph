Islamic–Jewish relations started in the 7th century CE with the origin and spread of Islam in the Arabian peninsula. The two religions share similar values, guidelines, and principles.<ref name="Why?">Prager, D; Telushkin, J. Why the Jews?: The Reason for Antisemitism. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1983. pp. 110–26.</ref> Islam also incorporates Jewish history as a part of its own. Muslims regard the Children of Israel as an important religious concept in Islam. Moses, the most important prophet of Judaism, is also considered a prophet and messenger in Islam.<ref>: "Also mention in the Book (the story of) Moses: for he was specially chosen, and he was a messenger (and) a prophet."</ref> Moses is mentioned in the Quran more than any other individual, and his life is narrated and recounted more than that of any other prophet.<ref name=Keeler>Annabel Keeler, "Moses from a Muslim Perspective", in: Solomon, Norman; Harries, Richard; Winter, Tim (eds.), urltoken Abraham's children: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in conversation, by. T&T Clark Publ. (2005), pp. 55–66.</ref> There are approximately 43 references to the Israelites in the Quran (excluding individual prophets),<ref>Yahud, Encyclopedia of Islam</ref> and many in the Hadith. Later rabbinic authorities and Jewish scholars such as Maimonides discussed the relationship between Islam and Jewish law. Maimonides himself, it has been argued, was influenced by Islamic legal thought.<ref>Sarah Stroumsa, urltoken Maimonides in His World: Portrait of a Mediterranean Thinker, Princeton University Press, 2009 pp. 65–66: 'we do know the extent of Maimonides' involvement in the wider Islamic culture. We know that, as far as science and learning are concerned, he was deeply immersed in the culture, and did his best to remain abreast of the developments that occurred in it. The reluctance to acknowledge his familiarity with Muslim law is therefore puzzling, particularly since there is no evidence for such reluctance on Maimonides' part' (p. 65)</ref>
Because Islam and Judaism share a common origin in the Middle East through Abraham, both are considered Abrahamic religions. There are many shared aspects between Judaism and Islam; Islam was strongly influenced by Judaism in its fundamental religious outlook, structure, jurisprudence and practice.<ref name="Why?"/> Because of this similarity, as well as through the influence of Muslim culture and philosophy on the Jewish community within the Islamic world, there has been considerable and continued physical, theological, and political overlap between the two faiths in the subsequent 1,400 years. Notably, the first Waqf was donated by a Jew, Mukhayriq.<ref name = "Muqtedar Khan"></ref> And in 1027, a Jew, Samuel ibn Naghrillah, became top advisor and military general of the Taifa of Granada.<ref> urltoken
