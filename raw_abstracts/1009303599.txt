TEMPEST (Telecommunications Electronics Materials Protected from Emanating Spurious Transmissions) is a U.S. National Security Agency specification and a NATO certification<ref name="USAF140107011"></ref><ref name="NIA1981"></ref> referring to spying on information systems through leaking emanations, including unintentional radio or electrical signals, sounds, and vibrations.<ref></ref><ref></ref> TEMPEST covers both methods to spy upon others and how to shield equipment against such spying. The protection efforts are also known as emission security (EMSEC), which is a subset of communications security (COMSEC).<ref></ref>
The NSA methods for spying on computer emissions are classified, but some of the protection standards have been released by either the NSA or the Department of Defense.<ref name=tempest_intro></ref> Protecting equipment from spying is done with distance, shielding, filtering, and masking.<ref name="tempest-history-nsa"></ref> The TEMPEST standards mandate elements such as equipment distance from walls, amount of shielding in buildings and equipment, and distance separating wires carrying classified vs. unclassified materials,<ref name=tempest_intro/> filters on cables, and even distance and shielding between wires or equipment and building pipes. Noise can also protect information by masking the actual data.<ref name="tempest-history-nsa"/>
While much of TEMPEST is about Van Eck phreaking, it also encompasses sounds and mechanical vibrations.<ref name=tempest_intro/> For example, it is possible to log a user's keystrokes using the Accelerometer inside smartphones. Compromising emissions are defined as unintentional information-bearing signals which, if intercepted and analyzed (side-channel attack), may disclose the information transmitted, received, handled, or otherwise processed by any information-processing equipment.<ref></ref>
