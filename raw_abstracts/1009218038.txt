The French language is spoken as a minority language in the United States. Roughly 2.10 million Americans over the age of five reported speaking the language at home in a federal 2010 estimate,<ref></ref><ref name="factfinder2.census.gov"></ref> making French the fourth most-spoken language in the nation behind English, Spanish, and Chinese (when Louisiana French, Haitian Creole and all other French dialects and French-derived creoles are included, and when Cantonese, Mandarin and other varieties of Chinese are similarly combined).<ref name="census1"></ref>
Several varieties of French evolved in what is now the United States:
*Louisiana French, spoken in Louisiana by descendants of colonists in French Louisiana
*New England French, spoken in New England by descendants of 19th and 20th-century Canadian migrants
*Missouri French, spoken in Missouri by descendants of French settlers in the Illinois Country
*Muskrat French, spoken in Michigan by descendants of habitants, voyageurs and coureurs des bois in the Pays d'en Haut
*Métis French, spoken in North Dakota by Métis people
More recently, French has also been carried to various parts of the nation via immigration from Francophone regions. Today, French is the second most spoken language (after English) in the states of Maine and Vermont. In Louisiana, it is tied with Spanish for second most spoken if Louisiana French and all creoles such as Haitian are included. French is the third most spoken language (after English and Spanish) in the states of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire.<ref name="factfinder2.census.gov"/><ref></ref>
