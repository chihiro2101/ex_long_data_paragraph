The Baikal seal, Lake Baikal seal or (Pusa sibirica), is a species of earless seal endemic to Lake Baikal in Siberia, Russia. Like the Caspian seal, it is related to the Arctic ringed seal. The Baikal seal is one of the smallest true seals and the only exclusively freshwater pinniped species.<ref name="MMOTW">Randall R. Reeves, Brent S. Stewart, Phillip J. clapham, James A. Powell, "National Audubon Society Guide to the Marine Mammals of the World", Alfred A.

The most recent population estimates are 80,000 to 100,000 animals, roughly equaling the expected carrying capacity of the lake.<ref name="iucn"/> At present, the species is not considered threatened.<ref name="iucn"/>
