Since towers supporting spires are usually square, square-plan spires emerge directly from the tower's walls, but octagonal spires either called for a pyramidal transition section called a broach at the spire's base, or else freed spaces around the tower's summit for decorative elements like pinnacles.<ref name=":1" /> The former solution is known as a broach spire.<ref name=":1" /> Small or short spires are known as spikes, spirelets, or fl√®ches.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0"></ref>
