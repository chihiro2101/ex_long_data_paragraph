A ship class is a group of ships of a similar design.<ref name="CDR Salamander"></ref> This is distinct from a ship type,<ref name="CDR Salamander" /> which might reflect a similarity of tonnage or intended use. For example, is a nuclear aircraft carrier (ship type) of the (ship class).
In the course of building a class of ships, design changes might be implemented. In such a case, the ships of different design might not be considered of the same class; each variation would either be its own class, or a subclass of the original class (see for an example). If ships are built of a class whose production had been discontinued, a similar distinction might be made.
Ships in a class often have names linked by a common factor: e.g. s' names all begin with T , , ; and s are named after American battles , , , . Ships of the same class may be referred to as sister ships.
