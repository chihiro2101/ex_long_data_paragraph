The Second Battle of the Marne (15 July â€“ 6 August 1918) was the last major German offensive on the Western Front during the World War I. The attack failed when an Allied counterattack, supported by several hundred tanks, overwhelmed the Germans on their right flank, inflicting severe casualties. The German defeat marked the start of Hundred Days Offensive which culminated in the Armistice with Germany about 100 days later.
