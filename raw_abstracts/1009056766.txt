It was signed by delegates of King Louis XVI and the Second Continental Congress in Paris on February 6, 1778, along with the Treaty of Amity and Commerce and a secret clause providing for the entry of other European allies;<ref> urltoken Preamble to Treaty of Alliance. "particularly in case Great Britain in Resentment of that connection and of the good correspondence which is the object of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, should break the Peace with France, either by direct hostilities, or by hindering her commerce and navigation, in a manner contrary to the Rights of Nations, and the Peace subsisting between the two Crowns."</ref> together these instruments are sometimes known as the Franco-American alliance<ref></ref> or the Treaties of Alliance.<ref></ref> The agreements marked the official entry of the United States on the world stage, and formalized France in the American Revolutionary War that was to be decisive in America's victory.
