The musical bow (bowstring or string bow, a subset of bar zithers) is a simple string instrument used by a number of South African peoples, which is also found in the Americas via slave trade.<ref></ref> It consists of a flexible, usually wooden, stick 1.5 to 10 feet (0.5 to 3 m) long, and strung end to end with a taut cord, usually metal. It can be played with the hands or a wooden stick or branch. It is uncertain if the musical bow developed from the hunting bow, though the San people of the Kalahari Desert do convert their hunting bows to musical use.<ref name=Brit/>
Types of bow include mouth-resonated string bow, ground bow, and gourd-resonated string bow.<ref>Nzewi, Meki and Nzewi, Odyke (2007).
