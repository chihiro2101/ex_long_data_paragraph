Barely a year later, on 1 September 1853 and with his wife pregnant for a fifth time, Hodgson died suddenly of a stroke, leaving the family without an income. Frances was cared for by her grandmother while her mother took over running the family business. From her grandmother, who bought her books, Frances learned to love reading, in particular her first book, The Flower Book, which had colored illustrations and poems. Because of their reduced income, Eliza had to give up their family home and moved with her children to live with relatives in Seedley Grove, Tanners Lane, Pendleton, Salford, where they lived in a house with a large enclosed garden in which Frances enjoyed playing.<ref></ref>
For a year Frances went to a small dame school run by two women, where she first saw a book about fairies. When her mother moved the family to Islington Square, Salford, Frances mourned the lack of flowers and gardens. Their new home was located in a gated square of faded gentility adjacent to an area with severe overcrowding and poverty that "defied description", according to Friedrich Engels, who lived in Manchester at the time.<ref></ref>
Frances had an active imagination, writing stories she made up in old notebooks. One of her favorite books was Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, and she spent many hours acting out scenes from the story.<ref>Robin Bernstein, urltoken Racial Innocence: Performing American Childhood from Slavery to Civil Rights, (New York: New York University Press, 2011), 69–71.

Manchester was almost entirely dependent on a cotton economy that was ruined by the Lancashire cotton famine brought about by the American Civil War.<ref name = "Gerzinap3"></ref> In 1863, Eliza Hodgson was forced to sell their business and move the family once again to an even smaller home; at that time Frances' limited education came to an end. Eliza's brother (Frances's uncle), William Boond, asked the family to join him in Knoxville, Tennessee, where he now had a thriving dry goods store. Within the year Eliza decided to accept his offer and move the family from Manchester.<ref></ref> She sold their possessions and told Frances to burn her early writings in the fire.<ref name = "Gerzinap3"/> In 1865, the family emigrated to the United States and settled near Knoxville.<ref name=neely>Jack Neely, " urltoken Frances Hodgson Burnett, the Knoxville Years," Knoxville Mercury, 18 November 2015.</ref>
