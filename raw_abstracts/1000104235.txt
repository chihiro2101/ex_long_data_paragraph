The Fokker Scourge (Fokker Scare) occurred during the First World War from July 1915 to early 1916, when Imperial German Flying Corps units, equipped with (Fokker monoplane) fighters, gained an advantage over the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the French .
The Fokker was the first service aircraft to be fitted with a machine gun synchronised to fire through the arc of the propeller without striking the blades. The tactical advantage of aiming the gun by aiming the aircraft and the surprise of its introduction were factors in its success.<ref name="Franks p. 1">Franks 2001, p. 1.</ref><ref name="Kennett 1991, p. 110">Kennett 1991, p. 110.</ref>
This period of German air superiority ended with the arrival in numbers of the French Nieuport 11 and British Airco DH.2 fighters, which were capable of challenging the Fokkers, although the last Fokkers were not finally replaced until August–September 1916.<ref>Bruce 1968, v.2, p. 20.</ref><ref name="Franks p. 1"/>
The term "Fokker Scourge" was coined by the British press in mid-1916, after the had been outclassed by the new Allied types.<ref>Robertson 2003, p. 103.</ref> Use of the term coincided with a political campaign to end a perceived dominance of the Royal Aircraft Factory in the supply of aircraft to the Royal Flying Corps, a campaign that was begun by the pioneering aviation journalist C. G. Grey and Noel Pemberton Billing M.P., founder of Pemberton-Billing Ltd (Supermarine from 1916) and a great enthusiast for aerial warfare.<ref>Hare 1990, pp. 91–102.</ref>
