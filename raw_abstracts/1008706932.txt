One minor mystery relating to Alexandra David-Néel has a solution. In Forbidden Journey, p.&nbsp;284, the authors wonder how Mme. David-Néel's secretary, Violet Sydney, made her way back to the West in 1939 after Sous des nuées d'orage (Storm Clouds) was completed in Tachienlu. Peter Goullart's Land of the Lamas (not in Forbidden Journeys bibliography), on pp.&nbsp;110–113 gives an account of his accompanying Ms. Sydney partway back, then putting her under the care of Lolo bandits to continue the journey to Chengdu. While in Kham David-Néel and Yongden completed circumambulation of the holy mountain Amne Machin.<ref> urltoken The Anye Machin peaks are considered to be the abode of the protector god Machin Pomri </ref>
In 1945, Alexandra David-Néel went back to India thanks to Christian Fouchet, French Consul at Calcutta, who became a friend; they stayed in touch until David-Néel's death. She finally left Asia with Aphur Yongden by airplane, departing from Calcutta in June 1946. On 1 July, they arrived at Paris, where they stayed until October, when they went back to Digne-les-Bains.<ref></ref>
