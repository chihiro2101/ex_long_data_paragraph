The Walt Disney Studios, located in Burbank, California, United States, serves as the corporate headquarters for The Walt Disney Company media conglomerate. The 51-acre (20.6 ha) studio lot also contains several sound stages, a backlot, and other filmmaking production facilities for Walt Disney Studios's motion picture production. The complex also houses the offices for the company's many divisions, with the exception of the 20th Century Studios (formerly 20th Century Fox), which remains on its namesake lot in Century City.
Walt Disney used the earnings from the successful release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to finance the construction of the Burbank studio. Disney is the only major film studio out of the Big Five that does not currently offer regular tours of their studio lot to the general public.<ref name="ut"></ref> Since the mid-2000s, Adventures by Disney has offered tours of the studio, but only as an integral component of their Southern California tour package.<ref name="ut" /> The other way to tour the studio is to join the official Disney D23 fan club, which offers tours to members every few months.<ref name="ut" /> The studio used to open to the public once a year in November on the Saturday before Thanksgiving for its annual Magical Holiday Faire craft sale, but stopped hosting the Faire around 2003.
