Minster is an honorific title given to particular churches in England, most notably York Minster, Westminster Abbey in London and Southwell Minster in Nottinghamshire.
The term minster is first found in royal foundation charters of the 7th century, when it designated any settlement of clergy living a communal life and endowed by charter with the obligation of maintaining the Canonical hours. Widespread in 10th-century Anglo-Saxon England, minsters declined in importance with the systematic introduction of parishes and parish churches from the 11th century onwards. It continued as a title of dignity in later medieval England, for instances where a cathedral, monastery, collegiate church or parish church had originated with an Anglo-Saxon foundation. Eventually a minster came to refer more generally to "any large or important church, especially a collegiate or cathedral church".<ref name="oed"/> In the 21st century, the Church of England has designated additional minsters by bestowing the status on existing parish churches.
