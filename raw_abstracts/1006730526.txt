Gene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product that enables it to produce protein as the end product. These products are often proteins, but in non-protein-coding genes such as Transfer RNA or Small nuclear RNA genes, the product is a functional RNA. Gene expression is summarized in the central dogma of molecular biology first formulated by Francis Crick in 1958,<ref></ref> further developed in his 1970 article,<ref></ref> and expanded by the subsequent discoveries of reverse transcription<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> and RNA replication.<ref></ref>
The process of gene expression is used by all known life—eukaryotes (including multicellular organisms), prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), and utilized by viruses—to generate the macromolecule machinery for life.
In genetics, gene expression is the most fundamental level at which the genotype gives rise to the phenotype, i.e. observable trait. The genetic information stored in DNA represents the genotype, whereas the phenotype results from the "interpretation" of that information. Such phenotypes are often expressed by the synthesis of proteins that control the organism's structure and development, or that act as enzymes catalyzing specific metabolic pathways.
All steps in the gene expression process may be modulated (regulated), including the transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of a protein. Gene regulation gives control over the timing, location, and amount of a given gene product (protein or ncRNA) present in a cell and can have a profound effect on the cellular structure and function. Regulation of gene expression is the basis for cellular differentiation, development, morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism. Gene regulation may therefore serve as a substrate for evolutionary change.
