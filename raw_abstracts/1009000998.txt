The Bashkirs ; , ; , are a Turkic people, indigenous to Bashkortostan and the historical region of Badzhgard. This area extends both sides of the Ural Mountains where Eastern Europe meets North Asia. Smaller communities of Bashkirs also live in the Tatarstan, Perm Krai, Chelyabinsk, Orenburg, Tyumen, Sverdlovsk, Kurgan Oblasts and other regions of Russia. Bashkirs also reside in Kazakhstan and other countries.
Most Bashkirs speak the Bashkir language, closely related to the Tatar and Kazakh languages which belong to the Kipchak branch of the Turkic languages. Cultural affinities are shared with the broader Turkic peoples. Religiously, the Bashkirs are mainly Sunni Islam of the Hanafi madhhab faith, following the Jadid doctrine.
The Bashkir people are subject to systematic Russification and discrimination. They lack the opportunity to study in their native language at school as well as at university.<ref>Mikhailov, Valentin.
