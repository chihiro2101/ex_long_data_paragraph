Family Feud is an American television game show created by Mark Goodson where two families compete to name the most popular responses to survey questions in order to win cash and prizes.
The show has had three separate runs; the original run from 1976 to 1985 aired on ABC during the daytime, and had a separate nighttime edition that ran in syndication and was also hosted by Richard Dawson. In 1988, the series was revived and aired on CBS and also had a nighttime syndication edition. This version was hosted by Ray Combs until 1994, and brought back Richard Dawson for the 1994–1995 season. A third run began in 1999 in syndication only, and continues to run to this day, being hosted by a series of different hosts, including Louie Anderson (1999–2002), Richard Karn (2002–2006), John O'Hurley (2006–2010), and Steve Harvey (2010–present). Aside from the hosts, there have been several studio announcers who would introduce the contestants and read credits. These have included Gene Wood (1976–1985, 1988–1995), Burton Richardson (1999–2010), Joey Fatone (2010–2015), and Rubin Ervin (2015–present). Within a year of its debut, the original version became the number one game show in daytime television; however, as viewing habits changed, the ratings declined. Harvey's takeover in 2010 increased Nielsen ratings significantly and eventually placed the program among the top three most popular syndicated television shows in the country. Harvey has also surpassed every previous host to date in length of single consecutive tenures, although Dawson hosted more episodes of the show. In 2013, TV Guide ranked Family Feud third in its list of the 60 greatest game shows of all time.
The program has spawned multiple regional adaptations in over 50 international markets outside the United States. Reruns of Steve Harvey-hosted episodes air on Game Show Network, while reruns of earlier versions air on Buzzr. Aside from television shows, there have been also many home editions produced in board game, interactive film, and video game formats.
