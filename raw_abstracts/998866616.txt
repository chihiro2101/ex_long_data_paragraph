The gens Sulpicia was one of the most ancient patrician families at ancient Rome, and produced a succession of distinguished men, from the foundation of the Republic to the Roman Empire. The first member of the gens who obtained the consulship was Servius Sulpicius Camerinus Cornutus, in 500 BC, only nine years after the expulsion of the Tarquins, and the last of the name who appears on the consular list was Sextus Sulpicius Tertullus in AD 158. Although originally patrician, the family also possessed plebs members, some of whom may have been descended from freedman of the gens.<ref name="DGRBM Sulpicia Gens">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol.
