In general relativity, a white hole is a hypothetical region of spacetime and singularity which cannot be entered from the outside, although energy-matter, light and information can escape from it. In this sense, it is the reverse of a black hole, which can be entered only from the outside and from which energy-matter, light and information cannot escape. White holes appear in the theory of eternal black holes. In addition to a black hole region in the future, such a solution of the Einstein field equations has a white hole region in its past.<ref></ref> However, this region does not exist for black holes that have formed through gravitational collapse, nor are there any observed physical processes through which a white hole could be formed.
Supermassive black holes (SBHs) are theoretically predicted to be at the center of every galaxy and that possibly, a galaxy cannot form without one. Stephen Hawking<ref>Hawking and Penrose, The Nature of Space and Time (Princeton, 1996)</ref> and others have proposed that these SBHs spawn a supermassive white hole/Big Bang.<ref></ref>
