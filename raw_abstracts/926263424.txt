For postage stamps, separation is the means by which individual stamps are made easily detachable from each other.
Methods of separation include:
# perforation: cutting rows and columns of small holes
# rouletting: small horizontal and vertical cuts
# diecutting: cut paper to shape using a metal dieâ€”used for self-adhesive stamps.
