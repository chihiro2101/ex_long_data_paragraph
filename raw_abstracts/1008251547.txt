John Henry is an American folk hero. An African American, he is said to have worked as a "steel-driving man"â€”a man tasked with hammering a steel drill into rock to make holes for explosives to blast the rock in constructing a railroad tunnel.
The story of John Henry is told in a classic blues folk song, which exists in many versions, and has been the subject of numerous stories, plays, books, and novels.<ref name=NPR></ref><ref name=Tracy/>
