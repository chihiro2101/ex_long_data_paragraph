Type 2 diabetes (T2D), formerly known as adult-onset diabetes, is a form of diabetes that is characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and relative lack of insulin.<ref name=NIH2014Cause></ref> Common symptoms include polydipsia, polyuria, and unexplained weight loss.<ref name=NIH2014Diag/> Symptoms may also include polyphagia, feeling tired, and sores that do not heal.<ref name=NIH2014Diag/> Often symptoms come on slowly.<ref name=NIH2014Cause/> Long-term complications from high blood sugar include heart disease, strokes, diabetic retinopathy which can result in blindness, kidney failure, and poor blood flow in the limbs which may lead to amputations.<ref name=WHO2015/> The sudden onset of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state may occur; however, ketoacidosis is uncommon.<ref name=Pas2014></ref><ref name=Fas2008></ref>
Type&nbsp;2 diabetes primarily occurs as a result of obesity and lack of exercise.<ref name=WHO2015/> Some people are more Heredity at risk than others.<ref name=NIH2014Cause/>
Type 2 diabetes makes up about 90% of cases of diabetes, with the other 10% due primarily to type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes.<ref name=WHO2015/> In type 1 diabetes there is a lower total level of insulin to control blood glucose, due to an autoimmune induced loss of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.<ref></ref><ref name=Green2011></ref> Diagnosis of diabetes is by blood tests such as fasting plasma glucose, oral glucose tolerance test, or glycated hemoglobin (A1C).<ref name=NIH2014Diag></ref>
Type&nbsp;2 diabetes is largely preventable by staying a normal weight, exercising regularly, and eating properly.<ref name=WHO2015/> Treatment involves exercise and diabetic diet.<ref name=WHO2015/> If blood sugar levels are not adequately lowered, the medication metformin is typically recommended.<ref name=Ann2016></ref><ref name=Fer005></ref> Many people may eventually also require insulin injections.<ref name=Kre2005></ref> In those on insulin, routinely checking blood sugar levels is advised; however, this may not be needed in those taking pills.<ref></ref> Bariatric surgery often improves diabetes in those who are obese.<ref name=Cet2015></ref><ref></ref>
Rates of type&nbsp;2 diabetes have increased markedly since 1960 in parallel with obesity.<ref></ref> As of 2015 there were approximately 392&nbsp;million people diagnosed with the disease compared to around 30&nbsp;million in 1985.<ref name=GBD2015Pre></ref><ref name=Epi2006></ref> Typically it begins in middle or older age,<ref name=NIH2014Cause/> although rates of type 2 diabetes are increasing in young people.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Type 2 diabetes is associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy.<ref name=Will2011></ref> Diabetes was one of the first diseases described.<ref name=Rip2011></ref> The importance of insulin in the disease was determined in the 1920s.<ref></ref>
