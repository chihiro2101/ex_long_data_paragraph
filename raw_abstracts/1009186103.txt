Chivalry & Sorcery is a fantasy role-playing game that was first published in 1977 by Fantasy Games Unlimited. Created by Edward E. Simbalist and Wilf K. Backhaus in 1977, Chivalry & Sorcery (C&S) was an early competitor to Dungeons & Dragons (D&D).<ref name=tresca2010></ref> Historically, the two designers of the game were dissatisfied with the lack of realism in D&D and created a gaming system derived from it,<ref name="space-opera1"></ref> which they named Chevalier. They intended to present it to Gary Gygax at Gen Con in 1977,<ref name="space-opera1"/> but changed their minds once at the Con, where they met Scott Bizar who wrote out a letter of intent.<ref name="ptgptb1"></ref> After some final changes to get rid of the last remnants of D&D<ref name="ptgptb1"/> (e.g. the game contained a table of "Saving-throws" similar to D&D), Simbalist and Backhaus published the first edition of their game - now renamed Chivalry & Sorcery - shortly after the release of the first edition Advanced D&D Monster Manual.
According to Michael Tresca, Chivalry & Sorcery "embraced a realistic approach to medieval France in the 12th century, complete with feudalism and the Catholic Church." and "was most noteworthy for creating the term "game master." (Actually though, that term had already previously been used in Tunnels & Trolls and Bunnies & Burrows.) "It was one of the first games to place the setting at utmost importance over the mechanics of the game."<ref name=tresca2010/> More focused on medieval chivalry than fantasy, Chivalry & Sorcery had from its first version a sophisticated and complex set of rules. The game has been published four times to improve its presentation and to modernize its game mechanics. C&S was the first to introduce new concepts like levels for monsters. Players could adventure in a variety of locations instead of being confined to a dark underground dungeon. The action taking place outside the framework of an adventure became very important, especially for magicians, who had to spend many days to learn their spells and enchant their materials.
