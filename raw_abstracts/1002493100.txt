Shebaa Farms, also spelled Sheba'a Farms , ; , Havot Sheba‘a or הר דוב, Har Dov) is a small strip of land at the intersection of the Lebanese-Syrian border and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The territory is about long and wide. Both Islamic and Jewish tradition hold that a location in the Sheeba farms, called Maqam 'Ibrahim al-Khalil in Arabic and Makom Habětarim in Hebrew, is the site of the covenant of the pieces, God's first covenant with Abraham, in the biblical Eretz Israel.<ref name="Kaufman-mej-page590" />
The territory is currently disputed, in part from the failure of the French Mandate administrations and later the Lebanese and Syrian governments, to demarcate the border between Lebanon and Syria. Documents from the 1920s and 1930s indicate that inhabitants paid taxes to the Lebanese government. However, from the early 1950s until Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights in the Six-Day War, Syria was the de facto ruling power.<ref name="Kaufman-pij"/> In 1978 1978 South Lebanon conflict, and in 1981, the Golan Heights, including the Shebaa Farms, were annexed by Israel, a move only recognized by the United States.<ref> urltoken Israeli views on Shebaa Farms harden, BBC</ref>
The territory has been a flashpoint for violence since South Lebanon conflict (1985–2000).<ref> urltoken Israel and Militants Trade Fire Across Lebanese Border, New York Times</ref> Hezbollah claimed that the withdrawal was not complete because Shebaa was on Lebanese – not Syrian – territory.<ref> urltoken Shebaa Farms – nub of conflict</ref> Following the Israeli withdrawal, the United Nations Secretary General issued a statement proposing the area for the operations of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon; in the statement the controversy was described, with 81 different maps being studied; the UN concluded that there is no evidence of the abandoned farmlands being Lebanese, but proposed to maintain the existing boundaries of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force in Syria (which had included the Shebaa Farms since 1967) "without prejudice" to any future agreement between Syria and Lebanon.<ref> urltoken Har Dov withdrawal not on the table</ref><ref name="UN-S-2000-460"/>
Low level conflict continued in the area from 2000-2006 and in early 2015. In August 2008 the president of Lebanon, Michel Suleiman, stated: "The countdown for liberating the rest of our lands has begun. And today I confirm the use of all available and legitimate means to achieve this goal".<ref></ref>
