The concept of First World originated during the Cold War and comprised countries that were aligned with NATO and the United States, and opposed the Soviet Union and/or communism during the Cold War. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the definition has instead largely shifted to any country with little political risk and a well functioning democracy, rule of law, capitalist economy, economic stability, and high standard of living. Various ways in which modern First World countries are often determined include GDP, GNP, literacy rates, life expectancy, and the Human Development Index.<ref> urltoken First World, Investopedia</ref> In common usage, "first world" typically refers to "the highly developed industrialized nations often considered the westernized countries of the world".<ref></ref>
