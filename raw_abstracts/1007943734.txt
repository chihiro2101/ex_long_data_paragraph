Dionysius I or Dionysius the Elder (c.432-367 BC) was a Greek tyrant of Syracuse, in Sicily. He conquered several cities in Sicily and southern Italy, opposed Carthage's influence in Sicily and made Syracuse the most powerful of the Western Greek colonies. He was regarded by the ancients as an example of the worst kind of despotâ€”cruel, suspicious and vindictive.<ref name="EB1911"> Endnotes:
