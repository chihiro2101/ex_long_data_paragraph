And Woodward has maintained the same position on top of journalism's ladder ever since Watergate."<ref>Ben Bradlee, A Good Life, 1995, pp. 12–13, New York: Simon and Schuster, .

I am convinced he writes only what he believes to be true or has been reliably told to be true. And he is certainly a force for keeping the government honest."<ref>David Gergen, Eyewitness to Power, 2000, p. 71, New York: Simon and Schuster, .</ref>
