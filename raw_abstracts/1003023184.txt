Bachman's warbler (Vermivora bachmanii) is a small passerine migratory bird that is critically endangered or extinct. This warbler was a migrant, breeding in swampy blackberry and cane thickets of the southeast United States and wintering in Cuba. There are some reports of the bird from the twenty-first century, but none are widely accepted. Some authorities accept a sighting in Louisiana, in August 1988 as confirmed,<ref name = "RecoveryPlan"></ref> but the last uncontroversial sightings date to the 1960s.
