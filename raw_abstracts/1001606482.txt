Adolf (c. 1255 – 2 July 1298) was House of Nassau from about 1276 and elected King of the Romans (King of Germany) from 1292 until his deposition by the prince-electors in 1298. He was never crowned by the Pope, which would have secured him the title of Holy Roman Emperor. He was the first physically and mentally healthy ruler of the Holy Roman Empire ever to be deposed without a papal excommunication. Adolf died shortly afterwards in the Battle of Göllheim fighting against his successor Albert of Habsburg.
He was the second in the succession of so-called count-kings of several rivalling comital houses striving after the Roman-German royal dignity.
His last agnatic dynastic descendant was William IV of Luxembourg.
