Chinese federalism refers to political theories which argue that China's central government should share sovereignty with regional entities, under a form of federalism. Such proposals were made in the early twentieth century, in connection with the end of the Qing dynasty; as well as recently, with a view to providing checks against the power of the central government, as well as settling the relationship between Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and other potential political entities.
Wu Bangguo, who used to be the official number two in China's leadership structure, said in 2011 there will be no federal system in China. "There will be no separation of powers between the different branches of government and no federal system" he said. "It is possible that the state could sink into the abyss of internal disorder if this happened."<ref></ref>
