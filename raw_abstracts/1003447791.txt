A suite, in Western classical music and jazz, is an ordered set of instrumental or orchestral/concert band pieces. It originated in the late 14th century as a pairing of dance tunes and grew in scope to comprise up to five dances, sometimes with a prelude, by the early 17th century. The separate movements were often thematically and tonally linked.<ref>Alison Latham (ed.) The Oxford Dictionary of Music (2002 edition), article; "Suite"</ref> The term can also be used to refer to similar forms in other musical traditions, such as the Turkish fasıl and the Arab nuubaat.
In the Baroque era the suite was an important musical form, also known as Suite de danses, Ordre (the term favored by François Couperin), Partita or Ouverture (after the theatrical "overture" which often included a series of dances) as with the orchestral suites of Christoph Graupner, Telemann and J.S. Bach.
During the 18th century the suite fell out of favour as a cyclical form, giving way to the symphony, sonata and concerto. It was revived in the later 19th century, but in a different form,<ref>Alison Latham (ed.) The Oxford Dictionary of Music (2002 edition), article; "Suite"</ref> often presenting extracts from a ballet (The Nutcracker), the incidental music to a play (L'Arlésienne Suites), opera, film (Lieutenant Kije Suite) or video game (Motoaki Takenouchi's 1994 suite to the Shining series),<ref> urltoken Symphonic Suite the Another Story of Shining Force</ref> or entirely original movements (Holberg Suite, The Planets).
