Rose Marie "Rosemary" Kennedy (September 13, 1918 â€“ January 7, 2005) was the eldest daughter born to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Kennedy. She was a sister of President John F. Kennedy and Senators Robert F. and Ted Kennedy.
In her early young adult years, Rosemary Kennedy experienced seizures and violent mood swings. In response to these issues, Rosemary's father arranged a prefrontal lobotomy for Rosemary in 1941 when she was 23 years of age. The procedure left Rosemary permanently incapacitated and rendered her unable to speak intelligibly.
Rosemary Kennedy spent most of the rest of her life being cared for at St. Coletta, an institution in Jefferson, Wisconsin. The truth about her situation and whereabouts was kept secret for decades. While she was initially isolated from her siblings and extended family following her lobotomy, Rosemary visited with them during her later life.
