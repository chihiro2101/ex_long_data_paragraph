Acadian French is a variety of French originally associated with the Acadians of what is now the Maritimes in Canada. The language is spoken by the Acadian Francophone population of the Canadian province of New Brunswick, by small minorities on the Gasp√© Peninsula and the Magdalen Islands of Quebec as well as in pockets of Francophones in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. In the United States, it is spoken in the Saint John Valley of northern Aroostook County, Maine. Besides standard French, New England French is the predominant form of French spoken elsewhere in Maine.
