Romanowsky staining, also known as Romanowsky–Giemsa staining, is a prototypical staining technique that was the forerunner of several distinct but similar stains widely used in hematology (the study of blood) and cytopathology (the study of diseased cells). Romanowsky-type stains are used to differentiate cells for microscopic examination in pathology specimens, especially blood and bone marrow films,<ref name="Theil, 2012" /> and to detect parasites such as malaria within the blood.<ref name="BainBates2016" /><ref name="Horobin, 2011" /><ref name="Marshall, 1978" /><ref name="Li, et al., 2012" /> Stains that are related to or derived from the Romanowsky-type stains include Giemsa, Jenner, Wright, Field, May–Grünwald and Leishman stains. The staining technique is named after the Russian physician Dmitri Leonidovich Romanowsky (1861&ndash;1921), who was one of the first to recognize its potential for use as a blood stain.<ref name="Bezrukov, 2017" />
