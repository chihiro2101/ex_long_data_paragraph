George Bryan "Beau" Brummell (7 June 1778 â€“ 30 March 1840)<ref></ref> was an iconic figure in Regency era and for many years the arbiter of men's fashion. At one time he was a close friend of the Prince Regent, the future King George IV, but after the two quarrelled, and Brummell got into debt, he had to take refuge in France. Eventually he died shabby and insane in Caen.
Brummell was remembered afterwards as the preeminent example of the dandy and a whole literature was founded upon his manner and witty sayings which has persisted. His name is still associated with style and good looks, and it has been given to a variety of modern products to suggest their high quality.
