In human anatomy, the ulnar nerve is a nerve that runs near the ulna bone. The ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint is in relation with the ulnar nerve. The nerve is the largest in the human body unprotected by muscle or bone, so injury is common.<ref></ref> This nerve is directly connected to the little finger, and the adjacent half of the ring finger, innervating the Hand of these fingers, including both front and back of the tips, perhaps as far back as the Nail (anatomy).
This nerve can cause an electric shock-like sensation by striking the medial epicondyle of the humerus from posteriorly, or inferiorly with the elbow flexed. The ulnar nerve is trapped between the bone and the overlying skin at this point. This is commonly referred to as bumping one's "funny bone". This name is thought to be a pun, based on the homophone between the name of the bone of the upper arm, the "humerus", and the word "humour".<ref></ref> Alternatively, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, it may refer to "the peculiar sensation experienced when it is struck".<ref></ref>
