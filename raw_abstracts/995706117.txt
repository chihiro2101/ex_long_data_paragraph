A pnictogen<ref name=Connelly2005></ref> or ; from "to choke" and -gen, "generator") is any of the chemical elements in group&nbsp;15 of the periodic table. This group is also known as the nitrogen family. It consists of the elements nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), bismuth (Bi), and perhaps the chemically uncharacterized synthetic element moscovium (Mc).
In modern IUPAC notation, it is called Group 15. In CAS and the old IUPAC systems it was called Group V<small>A</small> and Group V<small>B</small> respectively (pronounced "group five A" and "group five B", "V" for the Roman numeral 5).<ref name=Fluck1988></ref> In the field of semiconductor physics, it is still usually called Group V.<ref name=Adachi2005></ref> The "five" ("V") in the historical names comes from the "pentavalency" of nitrogen, reflected by the stoichiometry of compounds such as N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. They have also been called the pentels.
