A velomobile, velomobiel, velo, or bicycle car is a human-powered vehicle (HPV) enclosed for aerodynamic advantage and/or protection from weather and collisions.<ref>Frederik Van De Walle. urltoken The Velomobile as a Vehicle for more Sustainable Transportation , Retrieved on 23 November 2007.</ref> They are similar to recumbent bicycles, pedal go-karts and tricycles, but with a full fairing (aerodynamic or weather protective shell). A fairing may be added to a non-faired cycle, or the fairing may be an integral part of the structure, monocoque like that of an airplane. The term velomobile can be thought of as similar in scope to the cycle (pedal vehicle) world as the term automobile is to the automotive world.
They are not to be confused with purpose-built for racing or speed records fully fared vehicles with two wheels, generally called streamliners. Streamliners have set many speed and distance records.<ref> urltoken records</ref> Though fast in their own right, velomobiles are considered much more streetable machines. Using three or more wheels can have advantages for everyday use, including the ability to stop and start unaided, better stability, cross-wind handling, etc., though there are arguments made that the multiple track machines (three or more wheels) have aerodynamic disadvantages due to the drag of the extra wheels and the surface contact points.<ref> urltoken A good discussion on bicycle wheel aerodynamics is here.</ref> In practice though, velomobiles continue to be close to their two-wheel cousins in performance.<ref> urltoken velomobiles continue to be close to their 2 wheel cousins in performance</ref> 
There are few velomobile manufacturers; some are home-built. Some models have the operator's head exposed; this has the advantage of giving the operator unobstructed vision, hearing, and some cooling, with the disadvantage of being potentially more exposed to weather and less aerodynamic. Fully enclosed machines can suffer from heat or humidity issues as well as potential noise issues. 
The typical drive train<ref> urltoken typical drive train</ref> of a velomobile is not unlike a bicycle or recumbent. It will consist of a front bottom bracket with one or more chainrings, and a rear derailleur. Depending on the configuration of the velomobile there may be any number of idler pulleys, and chaintubes<ref> urltoken chaintubes</ref> along the drive train to manage and protect the chain. One of the defining characteristics of most velomobiles is that the Bicycle drivetrain systems are protected from weather and the road.
