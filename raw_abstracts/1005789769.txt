The Kansas City standard (KCS), or Byte standard, is a way of storing digital data on standard Cassette tape at a data rate of 300 bits per second. It originated in a symposium sponsored by Byte magazine in November 1975 in Kansas City, Missouri to develop a standard for storage of digital microcomputer data on inexpensive consumer quality cassettes. The first systems based on the standard appeared in 1976.
One variation on the basic standard was CUTS, which was identical at 300 bit/s, but had an optional 1200 bit/s mode as well. CUTS was the default encoding used by several later machine families, including those from Acorn and the MSX. MSX added an even higher 2400 bit/s mode that was otherwise similar. CUTS' 1200 bit/s mode was also the standard used for cross-platform BASICODE distribution.
Although the KCS standard existed from the earliest days of the microcomputer revolution, it failed to prevent a proliferation of alternative encodings. Most home computers of the era used their own formats that were incompatible with KCS or each other.
