In terrestrial zoology, the megafauna (from Greek μέγας megas "large" and New Latin fauna "animal life") comprises the large or giant animals of an area, habitat, or geological period. The most common thresholds used are weight over <ref name = "Stuart"></ref> or <ref name="MartinKlein1984"></ref><ref name = "islands&continents"> see page 17</ref> (i.e., having a mass comparable to or larger than a human) or over a tonne, <ref name = "Stuart"/><ref></ref><ref></ref> (i.e., having a mass comparable to or larger than an ox). The first of these include many species not popularly thought of as overly large, such as white-tailed deer and red kangaroo.
In practice, the most common usage encountered in academic and popular writing describes land mammals roughly larger than a human that are not (solely) domesticated. The term is especially associated with the Pleistocene megafauna – the land animals often larger than modern counterparts considered archetypical of the last ice age, such as mammoths, the majority of which in northern Eurasia, the Americas and Australia became extinct within the last forty thousand years.<ref> urltoken Ice Age Animals. Illinois State Museum</ref> Among living animals, the term megafauna is most commonly used for the largest extant terrestrial mammals, which are elephants, giraffes, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, and large bovines. Of these five categories of large herbivores, only bovines are presently found outside of Africa and southern Asia, but all the others were formerly more wide-ranging. Megafaunal species may be categorized according to their dietary type: megaherbivores (e.g., elephants), megacarnivores (e.g., lions), and, more rarely, megaomnivores (e.g., bears).
Other common uses are for giant aquatic species, especially whales, any of the larger wild or domesticated land animals such as larger antelope and cattle, as well as dinosaurs and other extinct giant reptilians.
The term megafauna is very rarely used to describe invertebrates, though it has occasionally been used for some species of extinct invertebrates that were much larger than all similar invertebrate species alive today, for example Meganisoptera of the Carboniferous period.
