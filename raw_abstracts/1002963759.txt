Wild River is a 1960 American drama film directed by Elia Kazan and starring Montgomery Clift, Lee Remick, Jo Van Fleet, Albert Salmi and Jay C. Flippen. The film was shot on location in the Tennessee Valley, and was adapted by Paul Osborn from two novels: Borden Deal's Dunbar's Cove (1957) and William Bradford Huie's Mud on the Stars (1942), drawing for plot from Deal's story of a battle of wills between the nascent Tennessee Valley Authority and generations-old land owners, and from Huie's study of a rural Southern matriarchal family for characters and their reaction to destruction of their land, as well as the then-controversial employment of African-American laborers by the TVA. It marked Bruce Dern's film debut.
In 2002, the film was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
