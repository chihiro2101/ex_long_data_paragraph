During the breeding season, the approximately 8 million sergeant thrush nesting in Ohio and their chicks probably consume more than 5.4 million kg of insects, an average of almost 53 kg / kmÂ². Many of these insects, such as the weevils (Hypera spp.), Come from alfalfa fields, pastures, oat fields and other crops. In cornfields, jaundices often feed on corn worms (Helicoverpa zea) and beetles of the genus Diabrotica. In early spring, sergeant thrushes consume corn borers (Ostrinia nubilalis) in fields with corn stubble.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/> However, Bendell et al. (1981) found that the economic benefit of pest control , such as larvae of that lepidopteran, by the red-winged blackbird only compensated for 20% of the damage to crops caused by this bird.<ref name="auto10"></ref><ref></ref>
