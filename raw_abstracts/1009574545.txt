Ball lightning is an unexplained phenomenon described as Luminosity, spherical objects that vary from pea-sized to several meters in diameter. Though usually associated with thunderstorms, the phenomenon is said to last considerably longer than the split-second flash of a lightning bolt. Some 19th-century reports<ref name="Rowe1905" /><ref name="Day1813" /> describe balls that eventually explode and leave behind an odor of sulfur. Descriptions of ball lightning appear in a variety of accounts over the centuries and have received attention from scientists.<ref></ref> An optical spectrum of what appears to have been a ball-lightning event was published in January 2014 and included a video at high frame rate.<ref name="BLspectrum">

Scientists have proposed a number of hypotheses to explain reports of ball lightning over the centuries, but scientific data on ball lightning remains scarce. The presumption of its existence has depended on reported public sightings, which have produced inconsistent findings. Owing to the lack of reproducible data, the existence of ball lightning as a physical phenomenon remains unproven.<ref name=bam></ref>
