The Linux Standard Base (LSB) is a joint project by several Linux distributions under the organizational structure of the Linux Foundation to standardize the software system structure, including the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard used in the Linux kernel. The LSB is based on the POSIX specification, the Single UNIX Specification (SUS), and several other open standards, but extends them in certain areas.
According to the LSB:
<blockquote>
The goal of the LSB is to develop and promote a set of open standards that will increase compatibility among Linux distributions and enable software applications to run on any compliant system even in binary form. In addition, the LSB will help coordinate efforts to recruit software vendors to port and write products for Linux Operating Systems.
</blockquote>
The LSB compliance may be certified for a product by a certification procedure.<ref></ref>
The LSB specifies for example: standard libraries, a number of commands and utilities that extend the POSIX standard, the layout of the file system hierarchy, run levels, the printing system, including spooling such as CUPS and tools like Foomatic, and several extensions to the X Window System.
LSB also specifies boot facilities, such as $local_fs, $network, which are used to indicate service dependencies in System V-style initialization scripts. A machine readable comment block at the top of a script provides the information necessary to determine at which point of the initialization process the script should be invoked. It is called the LSB header.<ref></ref>
The command <code>lsb_release -a</code> is available in many systems to get the LSB version details, or can be made available by installing an appropriate package, for example the <code>redhat-lsb</code> package in Red Hat-flavored distributions such as Fedora,<ref></ref> or the <code>lsb-release</code> package in Debian-based distributions.
