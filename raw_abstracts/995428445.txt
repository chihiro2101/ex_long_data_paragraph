The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company was an early American film studio. The studio was founded in 1907 and based in Chicago, and later had an additional film lot in Niles Canyon, California. Its stars included Francis X. Bushman, Gloria Swanson and studio co-owner, actor and director, Broncho Billy Anderson. It is probably best known today for its series of Charlie Chaplin comedies. In the 1920s, after it merged with other studios, it was absorbed into Warner Bros.
