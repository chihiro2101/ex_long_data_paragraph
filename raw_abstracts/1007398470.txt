"The Library of Babel" (original Spanish title: La biblioteca de Babel) is a short story by Argentina author and librarian Jorge Luis Borges (1899â€“1986), conceiving of a universe in the form of a vast library containing all possible 410-page books of a certain format and character set.
The story was originally published in Spanish in Borges' 1941 collection of stories The Garden of Forking Paths (The Garden of Forking Paths). That entire book was, in turn, included within his much-reprinted Ficciones (1944). Two English language translations appeared approximately simultaneously in 1962, one by James E. Irby in a diverse collection of Borges's works titled Labyrinths and the other by Anthony Kerrigan as part of a collaborative translation of the entirety of Ficciones.
