Bullet time (also known as frozen moment, dead time, flow motion or time slice)<ref name="frozen time new morph"></ref> is a visual effect or visual impression of detaching the time and space of a camera (or viewer) from those of its visible subject. It is a depth enhanced simulation of variable-speed action and performance found in films, broadcast advertisements, and realtime graphics within video games and other special media. It is characterized both by its extreme transformation of time (slow enough to show normally imperceptible and unfilmable events, such as flying bullets) and space (by way of the ability of the camera angle—the audience's Camera angle—to move around the scene at a normal speed while events are slowed). This is almost impossible with conventional slow motion, as the physical camera would have to move implausibly fast; the concept implies that only a "virtual camera", often illustrated within the confines of a computer-generated environment such as a virtual world or virtual reality, would be capable of "filming" bullet-time types of moments. Technical and historical variations of this effect have been referred to as time slicing, view morphing, temps mort (French: "dead time") and virtual cinematography.
The term "bullet time" had first been used within the original script of the 1999 film The Matrix,<ref name="guardian-sfx" /> and later in reference to the slow motion effects in the 2001 video game Max Payne.<ref name="max payne manual"></ref><ref></ref> In the years since the introduction of the term via the Matrix films it has become a commonly applied expression in popular culture.
