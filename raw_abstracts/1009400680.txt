The Apple IIGS (styled as II<small>GS</small>), the fifth and most powerful of the Apple II family, is a 16-bit personal computer produced by Apple Inc. While featuring the Macintosh look and feel, and resolution and color similar to the Amiga and Atari ST, it remains compatible with earlier Apple II models. The "GS" in the name stands for "Graphics and Sound," referring to its enhanced multimedia hardware, especially its state-of-the-art audio.<ref></ref>
The microcomputer is a radical departure from any previous Apple II, with its 16-bit 65C816 microprocessor, direct access to megabytes of random-access memory (RAM), and mouse. It was the first computer produced by Apple to use a color graphical user interface (color was introduced on the Macintosh II six months later) and Apple Desktop Bus interface for keyboards, mice, and other input devices. It is the first personal computer to have a wavetable synthesis chip, using technology from Ensoniq.
The IIGS set forth a promising future and evolutionary advancement of the Apple II line, but Apple increasingly focused on the Macintosh platform. Apple ceased IIGS production in December 1992.
