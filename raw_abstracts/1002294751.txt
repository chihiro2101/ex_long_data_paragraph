A squall is a sudden, sharp increase in wind speed lasting minutes, contrary to a wind gust lasting seconds.<ref name=AMS></ref> They are usually associated with active weather, such as rain showers, thunderstorms, or heavy snow.<ref></ref> Squalls refer to the increase to the sustained winds over that time interval, as there may be higher gusts during a squall event.<ref name=BOM></ref> They usually occur in a region of strong sinking air or cooling in the mid-atmosphere. These force strong localized upward motions at the leading edge of the region of cooling, which then enhances local downward motions just in its wake.
