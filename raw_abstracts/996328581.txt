"Live Free or Die" is the official motto of the U.S. state of New Hampshire, adopted by the state in 1945.<ref></ref> It is possibly the best-known of all state mottos, partly because it conveys an assertive independence historically found in American political philosophy and partly because of its contrast to the milder sentiments found in other state mottos.
The phrase was adopted from a toast written by General John Stark, New Hampshire's most famous soldier of the American Revolutionary War, on July 31, 1809. Poor health forced Stark to decline an invitation to an anniversary reunion of the Battle of Bennington. Instead, he sent his toast by letter:<ref></ref>
:Live free or die: Death is not the worst of evils.
By the time Stark wrote this, Vivre Libre ou Mourir ("Live free or die") was already a popular motto of the French Revolution.<ref>Simon Schama. Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution. New York: Vintage Books, 1989. p. 557</ref> The English romantic poet William Wordsworth also adopted this Revolutionary motto when he composed the line, â€œWe must be free or die, who speak the tongue that Shakespeare spoke."<ref>The line appears in the poem "It is not to be Thought of"</ref>
A possible source of such mottoes is Patrick Henry's famed March 23, 1775, speech to the House of Burgesses (the legislative body of the Virginia colony), which contained the following phrase: "Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!"
The motto was enacted at the same time as the Emblem of New Hampshire, on which it appears.<ref name="State of New Hampshire General Court"></ref>
