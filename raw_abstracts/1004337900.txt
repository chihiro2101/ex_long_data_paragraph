Domingo Felipe "Mingo" Cavallo (born San Francisco, Córdoba, July 21, 1946) is an Argentina economist and politician. He has a track record of public service and is known for implementing the Convertibility plan, which fixed the dollar-peso exchange rate at 1:1 between 1991 and 2001. This brought the Argentine inflation rate down from over 1,300% in 1990 to less than 20% in 1992 and nearly to zero during the rest of the 1990s.<ref></ref>
