Public policy is a course of action created and/or enacted, typically by a government, in response to public, real-world problems.<ref></ref> Beyond this broad definition, public policy has been conceptualized in a variety of ways.
A popular way of understanding and engaging in public policy is through a series of stages known as “the policy cycle”. The characterization of particular stages can vary, but a basic sequence is: agenda setting – formulation – legitimation – implementation – evaluation.
Officials considered as policymakers bear responsibility to reflect the interests of a host of different stakeholders. Policy design entails conscious and deliberate effort to define policy aims and map them instrumentally. Academics and other experts in policy studies have developed a range of tools and approaches to help in this task.
