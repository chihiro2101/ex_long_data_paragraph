The Belmonts are an American doo-wop group from the Bronx, New York, that originated in the mid-1950s. The original group consisted of Angelo D'Aleo (born February 3, 1940), Carlo Mastrangelo (October 5, 1937 &ndash; April 4, 2016), and Fred Milano (August 26, 1939 &ndash; January 1, 2012). They took their name from Belmont, the Bronx neighborhood in which they lived, known as the Little Italy, Bronx. There were several stages in their history, including the 1958â€“60 period with Dion DiMucci, when the group was named Dion and the Belmonts. At this time Mastrangelo sang the bass parts, Milano the second tenor, D'Aleo the falsetto (first tenor), and DiMucci did lead vocals.
