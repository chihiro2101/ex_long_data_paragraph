Marcion of Sinope ; Greek: <ref>First Apology of Justin Martyr, urltoken XXVI.5</ref> ; 85 &ndash; c. 160) was an important figure in Early Christianity. Marcion preached that the God who sent Jesus into the world was a different, higher Deity than the creator Yahweh. He considered himself a follower of Paul the Apostle, whom he believed to have been the only true Apostle of Jesus Christ. He published the earliest extant fixed collection of New Testament books,<ref></ref> making him a vital figure in the development of Christian history.
Church Fathers such as Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, and Tertullian denounced Marcion as a Heresy, and he was excommunicated by the church of Rome around 144. He published the first known canon of Christian scriptures,<ref name="bruce-134">Bruce 1988, p.&nbsp;134.</ref> which contained ten Pauline epistles (the Pastoral epistles weren't included) and a shorter version of the Gospel of Luke (the Gospel of Marcion). This made him a catalyst in the process of the development of the New Testament canon by forcing the proto-orthodox Church to respond to his canon.
