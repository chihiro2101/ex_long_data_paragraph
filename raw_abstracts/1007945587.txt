The score for Insurrection was composed by Jerry Goldsmith; his fourth score for the franchise.<ref name="bond-163">#bond: p. 163</ref> Goldsmith continued using the march and Klingon themes written for Star Trek: The Motion Picture in 1979, adding new themes and variations. Insurrection opens with Alexander Courage's Star Trek: The Original Series fanfare, introducing a six-note motif used in many of the film's action sequences. The Ba'ku are scored with a pastoral theme with repeating harps, string sections and a woodwind solo. The Ba'ku's ability to slow time was accompanied with a variation of this music.<ref name="bond-164">#bond: p. 164</ref>
Goldsmith used quick bursts of brass music to accompany the starship sequences. For scenes in which observers are watching the Ba'ku unseen, Goldsmith used a "spying theme" that resembles his conspiracy theme from Capricorn One. Composed of a piano, timpani percussion, and brass, the theme builds until it is interrupted by the action theme as Data opens fire. Goldsmith did not write a motif for the Son'a, but scored the action sequence without designating the Son'a as an antagonist, suggesting the film's revelation that the Son'a and Ba'ku are related. The film's climax is scored with the action theme, which is balanced with "sense of wonder" music similar to cues from The Motion Picture.<ref name="bond-164"/><ref></ref>
One scene in the film shows Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner conducting a duet of A British Tar from the Gilbert and Sullivan comic-opera H.M.S. Pinafore.<ref name=brumnotasweknow/> This replaced the original idea of Picard and Data reciting scenes from Shakespeare's play King Lear.<ref name="piller80">#piller1998: p. 80</ref> Stewart had suggested that they sing Three Little Maids from School are we from The Mikado instead, but the producers described this as "too vulgar".<ref name=brumnotasweknow/> Stewart and Spiner had previously sung together on Spiner's 1991 album Ol' Yellow Eyes Is Back.<ref name=brumnotasweknow/>
