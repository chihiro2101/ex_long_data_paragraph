AllMusic. Retrieved December 27, 2013.</ref> One of the first prominent jazz musicians on his instrument, as Joachim E. Berendt explained: "there were some tenor players before him, but the instrument was not an acknowledged jazz horn".<ref name="berendt"></ref> Hawkins biographer John Chilton described the prevalent styles of tenor saxophone solos prior to Hawkins as "mooing" and "rubbery belches."<ref name="chilton" /> Hawkins cited as influences Happy Caldwell, Stump Evans, and Prince Robinson, although he was the first to tailor his method of improvisation to the saxophone rather than imitate the techniques of the clarinet. Hawkins' virtuosic, arpeggiated approach to improvisation, with his characteristic rich, emotional, loud, and vibrato-laden tonal style, was the main influence on a generation of tenor players that included Chu Berry, Charlie Barnet, Tex Beneke, Ben Webster, Vido Musso, Herschel Evans, Buddy Tate, and Don Byas, and through them the later tenormen, Arnett Cobb, Illinois Jacquet, Flip Phillips, Ike Quebec, Al Sears,<ref name="New Grove"></ref> Paul Gonsalves, and Lucky Thompson.<ref name="ratliff"></ref> While Hawkins became well known with swing music during the big band era, he had a role in the development of bebop in the 1940s.<ref name=ALLMUSIC />

As far as myself, I think I'm the second one."<ref name="berendt" /> Miles Davis once said: "When I heard Hawk, I learned to play ballads."<ref name="berendt" />
