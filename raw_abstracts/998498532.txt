A non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is an RNA molecule that is not translated into a protein. The DNA sequence from which a functional non-coding RNA is transcribed is often called an RNA gene. Abundant and functionally important list of RNAs include transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), as well as small RNAs such as microRNAs, siRNAs, piRNAs, snoRNAs, snRNAs, exRNAs, scaRNAs and the long ncRNAs such as Xist and HOTAIR.
The number of non-coding RNAs within the human genome is unknown; however, recent transcriptomic and bioinformatic studies suggest that there are thousands of them.<ref name="pmid15790807"></ref><ref name="pmid17571346" /><ref name="pmid17568003"></ref><ref name= MorrisKV></ref><ref name="Shahrouki P 2012"></ref><ref></ref> Many of the newly identified ncRNAs have not been validated for their function.<ref name="pmid15851066"></ref> It is also likely that many ncRNAs are non functional (sometimes referred to as junk RNA), and are the product of spurious transcription.<ref name="waste"></ref><ref name="PalazzoLee2015"></ref>
Non-coding RNAs are thought to contribute to diseases including cancer and Alzheimer's.
