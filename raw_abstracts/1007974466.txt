Royal Prussia was established after the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), from territory in western Prussia which seceded from the despotic State of the Teutonic Order seeking protection as a dependency of the King of Poland.<ref name=Paul></ref><ref name=Dwyer></ref> As a dependency, it was not part of Poland yet a subject to the Polish king, reflected in the title "Royal Prussia" or the King's Prussia. Royal Prussia retained autonomy, governing itself and maintaining its own laws, customs, rights and German language.<ref></ref> As a royal dependency, it could participate in the election of its titular monarch, however it could not participate in the Sejm, the Polish parliament.<ref>Frost, Robert, The Oxford History of Poland-Lithuania, Vol. I</ref>
In 1772, the former territories of Royal Prussia were annexed by Prussia. This occurred at the time of the First Partition of Poland, when much of it was formed into the province of West Prussia, while the vast bulk of the Polish Commonwealth itself was incorporated into the Russian Empire; and the ancient Commonwealth, with its "golden liberty", was dismembered.
