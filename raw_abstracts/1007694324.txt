The Battle of Varna took place on 10 November 1444 near Varna in eastern Bulgaria. The Ottoman Army under Murad II (who did not actually rule the sultanate at the time) defeated the Hungary–Poland and Wallachian armies commanded by Władysław III of Poland (also King of Hungary), John Hunyadi (acting as commander of the combined Christian forces) and Mircea II of Wallachia. It was the final battle of the Crusade of Varna.<ref>Bodnar, Edward W. Ciriaco d'Ancona e la crociata di Varna, nuove prospettive.
