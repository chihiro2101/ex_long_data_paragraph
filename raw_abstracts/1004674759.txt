Golden rice is a variety of rice (Oryza sativa) produced through genetic engineering to biosynthesis beta-carotene, a precursor of retinol, in the edible parts of rice.<ref name="ketten"></ref><ref name="ye2000"></ref> It is intended to produce a fortified food to be grown and consumed in areas with a Vitamin A deficiency, a deficiency which each year is estimated to kill 670,000 children under the age of 5<ref>Black RE et al., Maternal and child undernutrition: global and regional exposures and health consequences, The Lancet, 2008, 371(9608), p. 253.</ref> and cause an additional 500,000 cases of irreversible childhood blindness.<ref name="humphery1992" /> Rice is a staple food crop for over half of the world's population, providing 30â€“72% of the energy intake for people in Asian countries, and becoming an effective crop for targeting vitamin deficiencies.<ref></ref>
Golden rice differs from its parental strain by the addition of three beta-carotene biosynthesis genes. The parental strain can naturally produce beta-carotene in its leaves, where it is involved in photosynthesis. However, the plant does not normally produce the pigment in the endosperm, where photosynthesis does not occur. Golden rice has met significant opposition from environmental and anti-globalization activists. A study in the Philippines is aimed to evaluate the performance of golden rice, whether it can be planted, grown and harvested like other rice varieties, and whether golden rice poses risk to human health.<ref> urltoken PhilRice Two seasons of Golden Rice trials in Phl concluded, 09 June 2013.</ref> There has been little research on how well the beta-carotene will hold up when stored for long periods between harvest seasons, or when cooked using traditional methods.<ref></ref>
