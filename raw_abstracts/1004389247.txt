Ijmāʿ is an Arabic term referring to the consensus or agreement of Islamic scholars on a point of Islamic law.<ref name="Modarresi"></ref> Various schools of thought within Islamic jurisprudence may define this consensus to be that of the Sahaba only; or the consensus of the Salaf; or the consensus of the Ulema of the Muslim world, or scholarly consensus; or the consensus of all the Muslim world, both scholars and laymen. Sunni Muslims regard ijmā' as the third fundamental source of Sharia, after the Qur'an, and the Sunnah. The opposite of ijma (i.e., lack of consensus on a point of Islamic law) is called ikhtilaf.
