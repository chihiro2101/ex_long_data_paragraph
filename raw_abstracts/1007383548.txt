Hirta is the largest island in the St Kilda archipelago, on the western edge of Scotland. The names (in Scottish Gaelic) and Hirta (historically in English) have also been applied to the entire archipelago. Now virtually unpopulated, the island had nearly all of St Kilda's population of about 180 residents in the late 17th century and 112 in 1851. It was abandoned in 1930 when the last 36 remaining inhabitants were evacuated to Lochaline on the mainland.<ref></ref>
