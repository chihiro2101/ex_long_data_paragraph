The following year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon, Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.<ref>Mitchell, Donald. urltoken "Promenade Concerts", The Musical Times, October 1953, p.&nbsp;472. </ref> In 1956 the LPO toured the Soviet Union, the first British orchestra to do so; the conductors were Boult, Anatole Fistoulari and George Hurst, and the soloists were Alfredo Campoli and Moura Lympany.<ref>Pepper, Maurice. urltoken "The London Philharmonic Orchestra in Russia", The Musical Times, February 1957, pp.&nbsp;67–69. </ref> After the tour Boult retired as principal conductor, but remained closely associated with the orchestra, and was made its President in 1965.

Through the middle and late 1950s the LPO worked with new conductors including Constantin Silvestri and Josef Krips. This was a bad period financially for the orchestra, and it was forced to abandon fixed contracts for its players with holiday and sick pay and pensions, and revert to payment by engagement.<ref name=moore>Moore (unnumbered page)</ref> Financial disaster was averted thanks to an anonymous benefactor, generally believed to be Boult.<ref>Pirouet, p.&nbsp;119.</ref> A historian of the orchestra, Edmund Pirouet, writes that having been on an upward curve in the 1940s, by the mid-1950s the orchestra "was at best marking time".<ref>Pirouet, p.&nbsp;116.</ref>
In 1958 the LPO appointed William Steinberg, also music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, as chief conductor. He was a noted orchestral trainer, and did much to restore playing standards to their former levels.<ref name="moore" /> Steinberg resigned the LPO post after two seasons, advised by his doctor to restrict his activities.<ref>"Dr Steinberg leaving London Philharmonic", The Guardian, 1 August 1960.</ref>
