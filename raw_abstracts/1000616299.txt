In business management, micromanagement is a management style whereby a manager closely observes and/or controls and/or reminds the work of their subordinates or employees.
Micromanagement is generally considered to have a negative connotation, mainly because it shows a lack of freedom in the workplace.<ref name=Chambers>Chambers, Harry (2004). urltoken My Way or the Highway. Berrett Koehler Publishers, San Francisco. Retrieved on 20 June 2008.</ref><ref></ref>
