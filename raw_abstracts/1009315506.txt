An electrical connector is an electromechanical device used to join electrical conductors and create an electrical circuit.<ref name="ieee"></ref> Most electrical connectors have a genderi.e. the male component, called a plug, connects to the female component, or socket. The connection may be removable (as for portable equipment), require a tool for assembly and removal, or serve as a permanent electrical joint between two points.<ref name="RSM98"></ref> An adapter can be used to join dissimilar connectors.
Thousands of configurations of connectors are manufactured for power, data, and audiovisual applications.<ref name="elliott"></ref> Electrical connectors can be divided into four basic categories, differentiated by their function:<ref name="sparkfun"></ref>
* inline or cable connectors permanently attached to a cable, so it can be plugged into another terminal (either a stationary instrument or another cable)<ref name="connector-def"></ref>
* Chassis or panel connectors permanently attached to a piece of equipment so users can connect a cable to a stationary device
* PCB mount connectors soldered to a printed circuit board, providing a point for cable or wire attachment.<ref name="taoe" /> (e.g. pin headers, screw terminals, board-to-board connectors)
* Splice or butt connectors (primarily insulation displacement connectors) that permanently join two lengths of wire or cable
In computing, electrical connectors are considered a physical interface and constitute part of the physical layer in the OSI model of networking.
