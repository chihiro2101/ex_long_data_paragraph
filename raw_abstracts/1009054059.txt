Ehlersâ€“Danlos syndromes are a group of rare genetic connective tissue disease.<ref name=NIHGHR2016/> Symptoms may include loose joints, joint pain, stretchy velvety skin, and abnormal scar formation.<ref name=NIHGHR2016/> These can be noticed at birth or in early childhood.<ref name=Net2012></ref> Complications may include aortic dissection, joint dislocations, scoliosis, chronic pain, or early osteoarthritis.<ref name=NIHGHR2016/><ref name=Law2005/>
EDS occurs due to variations of more than 19 different genes that are present at birth.<ref name=NIHGHR2016/> The specific gene affected determines the type of EDS.<ref name=NIHGHR2016/> Some cases result from a new variation occurring during early development, while others are inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive manner.<ref name=NIHGHR2016/> Typically, these variations result in defects in the structure or processing of the protein collagen.<ref name=NIHGHR2016/>
Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and confirmed with genetic testing or skin biopsy,<ref name=Law2005/> but people may initially be misdiagnosed with hypochondriasis, depression, or chronic fatigue syndrome.<ref name=Law2005/> A large number of signs and symptoms still remain to be identified and linked to EDS, and ignorance on the part of physicians is, according to rehabilitation medicine physician Claude Hamonet, "at the origin of therapeutic errors accompanied by the iatrogenic effects of prejudice towards these patients."<ref name="SOJNEUROLOGY"></ref>
No cure is known.<ref name=Fer2016></ref> Treatment is supportive in nature.<ref name=Law2005/> Physical therapy and bracing may help strengthen muscles and support joints.<ref name=Law2005></ref> While some forms of EDS result in a normal life expectancy, those that affect blood vessels generally decrease it.<ref name=Fer2016/>
The hypermobile type of EDS (hEDS) affects at least one in 5,000 people globally;<ref name=NIHGHR2016></ref><ref></ref> other types occur at lower frequencies.<ref></ref><ref name=":6" /> The prognosis depends on the specific disorder.<ref name=Law2005/> Excess mobility was first described by Hippocrates in 400 BC.<ref></ref> The syndromes are named after two physicians, Edvard Ehlers from Denmark and Henri-Alexandre Danlos from France, who described them at the turn of the 20th century.<ref name=Byers2012> </ref>
