Joseph-Napoléon-Henri Bourassa ; September 1, 1868 &ndash; August 31, 1952) was a French Canadian political leader and publisher. In 1899, Bourassa was outspoken against the British government's request for Canada to send a militia to fight for Britain in the Second Boer War. Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier's compromise was to send a volunteer force, but the seeds were sown for future conscription protests during the World Wars of the next half-century. Bourassa unsuccessfully challenged the proposal to build warships to help protect the empire. He led the Conscription Crisis of 1917 and argued that Canada's interests were not at stake. He opposed Catholic bishops who defended military support of Britain and its allies.<ref>Rolando Gomes, "Henri Bourassa et l'Imperialisme Britannique (1899-1918)," Bulletin d'Histoire Politique (2008) 16#3 pp 161-182.</ref> Bourassa was an ideological father of French-Canadian nationalism.<ref>Susan Mann, Dream of Nation: a Social and Intellectual History of Quebec (2nd ed. 2003) pp 169-75, 205-25</ref> Bourassa was also a defining force in forging French Canada’s attitude to the Canadian Confederation of 1867.<ref></ref>
