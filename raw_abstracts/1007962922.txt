The history of elephants in Europe dates back to the time of the Roman Empire, but previously, during the Ice Age, relatives of elephants inhabited areas across Asia and Europe, such as mammoths (proboscideans related to elephants) which roamed the northern parts of the Earth, from Europe to North America. There was also the dwarf elephant of Cyprus (Cyprus dwarf elephant), Sicily-Malta (Palaeoloxodon falconeri) and mainland Europe (Palaeoloxodon antiquus). However, these became extinct several thousand years ago, and subsequently the presence of actual elephants in Europe was only due to importation of these animals.
