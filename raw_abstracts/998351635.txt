Titus Labienus (c. 100 â€“ 17 March 45 BC) was a professional Roman soldier in the late Roman Republic. He served as tribune of the Plebs in 63 BC. Although remembered as one of Julius Caesar's lieutenants in Gaul, mentioned frequently in the accounts of his military campaigns, Labienus chose to oppose him during the Civil War and was killed at Munda. He was the father of Quintus Labienus.
