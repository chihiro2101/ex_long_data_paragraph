The setting of The Phantom of the Opera came from an actual Paris opera house, Palais Garnier, that Leroux had heard the rumours about from the time the opera house was finished. Act one of the opera Helle had just finished when a fire in the roof of the opera house melted through a wire holding a counterweight for the chandelier, causing a crash that injured several and killed one. Using this accident paired with rumors of a ghost in that same opera house, Leroux wrote Le Fantôme de l'Opéra and published it in 1910, which was later published in English as The Phantom of the Opera.<ref></ref> The details about the Palais Garnier, and rumours surrounding it, are closely linked in Leroux's writing. The underground lake that he wrote about is accurate to this opera house, and it is still used for training firefighters to swim in the dark. The infamous chandelier crash also is true.<ref></ref> The mysteries that Leroux uses in his novel about the Phantom are still mysteries.<ref name=":2"></ref> However, he defended the rumors to be true, even on his death bed.<ref></ref>
The Phantom of the Operas origins came from Leroux's curiosity with the Phantom being real. In the prologue, he tells the reader about the Phantom and the research that he did to prove the truth of the ghost. Leroux's findings connected the corpse from the opera house to the Persian, to the Phantom, himself.<ref></ref>
