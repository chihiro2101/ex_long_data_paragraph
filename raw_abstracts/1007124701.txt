Carrageenans or carrageenins , from Irish , "little rock") are a family of linear sulfated polysaccharides that are extracted from red edible seaweeds. They are widely used in the food industry, for their gelling, thickening, and stabilizing properties. Their main application is in dairy and meat products, due to their strong binding to food proteins. There are three main varieties of carrageenan, which differ in their degree of sulfation. Kappa-carrageenan has one sulfate group per disaccharide, iota-carrageenan has two, and lambda-carrageenan has three.
Gelatinous extracts of the Chondrus crispus (Irish moss) seaweed have been used as food additives since approximately the fifteenth century.<ref> urltoken FAO Agar and Carrageenan Manual.

There is no clinical evidence for carrageenan as an unsafe food ingredient, mainly because its fate after digestion is inadequately determined.<ref name=efsa/> 
The first seaweed farming of Eucheuma and Kappaphycus spp. for carrageenan was developed in the Philippines. The global top producers of carrageenan are the Philippines and Indonesia.<ref name="Buschmann"></ref><ref name="PEMSEA"></ref><ref name="Habito"></ref> Carrageenan, along with agar, are used to produce traditional jelly deserts in the Philippines called gulaman.<ref name="MontaÃ±o"></ref>
