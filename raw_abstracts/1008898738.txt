A thermographic camera (also called an infrared camera or thermal imaging camera or thermal imager) is a device that creates an image using infrared, similar to a common camera that forms an image using visible light. Instead of the 400–700 nanometre range of the visible light camera, infrared cameras are sensitive to wavelengths from about 1,000&nbsp;nm (1&nbsp;μm) to about 14,000&nbsp;nm (14&nbsp;μm). The practice of capturing and analyzing the data they provide is called thermography.
