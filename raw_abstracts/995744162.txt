Francesco Vianello (30 August 1952&nbsp;â€“ 3 May 2009), better known by his nickname Fravia (sometimes +Fravia or Fravia+), was a reverse engineering,<ref name="Halbert1999"></ref><ref name="Gutmann2004"></ref><ref name="Sulianta"></ref> and hacker,<ref name="Kant2011"></ref> who maintained a web archive of reverse engineering techniques and papers.<ref name="StreetNabors2010"></ref><ref name="PeikariChuvakin2004"></ref> He also worked on steganography.<ref name="Pfitzmann2000"></ref> He taught on subjects such as data mining, anonymity and stalking.<ref name=Chaos/>
Vianello spoke six languages (including Latin) and had a degree in the history of the early Middle Ages. He was an expert in linguistics-related informatics.<ref name=Chaos/> For five years he made available a large quantity of material related to reverse engineering through his website, which also hosted the advice of reverse engineering experts, known as reversers, who provided tutorials and essays on how to hack software code as well as advice related to the assembly and disassembly of applications,<ref name="McNamara2003"></ref><ref name="Slade2004"></ref> and software protection reversing.<ref name="Sulianta"/>
Vianello's web presence dates from 1995 when he first got involved in research related to reverse code engineering (RCE). In 2000 he changed his focus and concentrated on advanced internet search methods and the reverse engineering of search engine code.<ref name="McNamara2003"/><ref name=T2/>
His websites "www.fravia.com" and "www.searchlores.org" contained a large amount of specialised information related to data mining.<ref name=T2/> His website "www.searchlores.org" has been called a "very useful instrument for searching the web",<ref name="Donato2009"></ref> and his "www.fravia.com" site has been described as "required reading for any spy wanting to go beyond simple Google searches."<ref name="McNamara2003"/>
There are still several mirrors of Fravia's old websites, even though the original domain names are no longer functional. The last mirror of Search Lores linked originally by Fravia directly from his website urltoken ("search.lores.eu") went offline in February 2020, but a new mirror came to existence later in 2020 at urltoken fravia.net.
