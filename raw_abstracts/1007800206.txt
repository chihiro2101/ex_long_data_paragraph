Nuclear terrorism refers to any person or persons who detonate a nuclear weapon as an act of terrorism (meaning illegal or immoral use of violence for a political or religious cause).<ref name=Dossier></ref> Some definitions of nuclear terrorism include the sabotage of a nuclear facility and/or the detonation of a radiological device, colloquially termed a dirty bomb, but consensus is lacking. In legal terms, nuclear terrorism is an offense committed if a person unlawfully and intentionally "uses in any way radioactive material … with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury; or with the intent to cause substantial damage to property or to the environment; or with the intent to compel a natural or legal person, an international organization or a State to do or refrain from doing an act", according to the 2005 United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.<ref></ref>

However, despite thefts and trafficking of small amounts of fissile material, all low-concern and less than Special nuclear material (SNM), there is no credible evidence that any terrorist group has succeeded in obtaining Category I SNM, the necessary multi-kilogram critical mass amounts of weapons grade plutonium required to make a nuclear weapon.<ref name="Bunn">Matthew Bunn. urltoken Preventing a Nuclear 9/11 Issues in Science and Technology, Winter 2005, p. v.</ref><ref name="today.ucla.edu">Ajay Singh. urltoken Nuclear terrorism — Is it real or the stuff of 9/11 nightmares?
