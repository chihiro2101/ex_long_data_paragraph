Scott William Raynor, Jr. (born May 23, 1978) is an American musician, best known as the original drummer of the rock band Blink-182. Born in Poway, California, Raynor first approached the drums in his preteens as a fan of Metallica. He joined Blink-182 at 14 years old and continued with the band; by the time he was 19, the group had accumulated a large fan base and a gold record, Dude Ranch. His heavy use of alcohol caused tension in the trio, leading to a fight, that in turn led to his firing from the band midway through a 1998 tour; Travis Barker would then replace him.
Since his booting from the group, Raynor has performed with a wide variety of groups and contributed to the charity StandUp for Kids.
