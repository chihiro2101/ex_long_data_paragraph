Life extension is the concept of extending the human lifespan, either modestly through improvements in medicine or dramatically by increasing the maximum lifespan beyond its generally-settled oldest people.<ref name=turner></ref> The technology to achieve such dramatic changes, however, does not currently exist.<ref name=AMA/>
Several researchers in the area, along with "life extensionists", "immortalists" or "longevists" (those who wish to achieve longer lives themselves), postulate that future breakthroughs in tissue rejuvenation, stem cells, regenerative medicine, molecular repair, gene therapy, pharmaceuticals and organ replacement (such as with artificial organs or xenotransplantations) will eventually enable humans to have indefinite lifespans (agerasia<ref></ref>) through complete rejuvenation to a healthy youthful condition. The ethical ramifications, if life extension becomes a possibility, are debated by bioethicists.
The sale of purported anti-aging products such as supplements and hormone replacement is a lucrative global industry. For example, the industry that promotes the use of hormones as a treatment for consumers to slow or reverse the aging process in the US market generated about $50&nbsp;billion of revenue a year in 2009.<ref name=AMA/> The use of such products, however, has not been proven to be effective or safe.<ref name=AMA/><ref name=Holliday></ref><ref name="PositionStatement"/><ref name= EMBOSENS/>
