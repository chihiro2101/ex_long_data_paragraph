Pidgin (formerly named Gaim) is a free and open-source multi-platform instant messaging client, based on a library named libpurple that has support for many instant messaging protocols, allowing the user to simultaneously Login to various services from a single application, with a single interface for both popular and obsolete protocols (from AOL to Discord), thus avoiding the hassle of having to deal with a new software for each device and protocol.
The number of Pidgin users was estimated to be over three million in 2007.<ref> urltoken "Luke Schierer discusses Pidgin, Open source and life" . PC World Australia, October 10, 2007.</ref>
Pidgin is widely used for its Off-the-Record Messaging (OTR) plugin, which offers end-to-end encryption. For this reason it is included in the privacy- and anonymity-focused operating system Tails.<ref></ref>
