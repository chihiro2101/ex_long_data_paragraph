Forkhead box protein P2 (FOXP2) is a protein that, in humans, is encoded by the FOXP2 gene. FOXP2 is a member of the forkhead box family of transcription factors, proteins that regulate gene expression by binding to DNA. It is expressed in the brain, heart, lungs and digestive system.<ref name="Fisher_1998"></ref><ref name="Lai_2000"></ref>
FOXP2 is found in many vertebrates, where it plays an important role in mimicry in birds (such as birdsong) and echolocation in bats. FOXP2 is also required for the proper development of speech and language in humans.<ref name="Lai_2001"></ref> In humans, mutations in FOXP2 cause the severe speech and language disorder developmental verbal dyspraxia.<ref name="Lai_2001" /><ref name="MacDermot_2005"></ref> Studies of the gene in mice and songbirds indicate that it is necessary for vocal imitation and the related motor learning.<ref name="Groszer 2008"></ref><ref name="Haesler_2007" /><ref name="Fisher_2009"></ref> Outside the brain, FOXP2 has also been implicated in development of other tissues such as the lung and digestive system.<ref name="Shu_2007" />
Initially identified in 1998 as the genetic cause of a speech disorder in a British family designated the KE family, FOXP2 was the first gene discovered to be associated with speech and language<ref></ref> and was subsequently dubbed "the language gene".<ref></ref> However, other genes are necessary for human language development, and a 2018 analysis confirmed that there was no evidence of recent positive evolutionary selection of FOXP2 in humans.<ref name="Atkinson_2018" /><ref name=":1"></ref>
