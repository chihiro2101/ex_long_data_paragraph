Ventricular fibrillation (V-fib or VF) is an abnormal heart rhythm in which the ventricles of the heart quiver instead of pumping normally.<ref name=NIH2011/> It is due to disorganized electrical activity.<ref name=NIH2011/> Ventricular fibrillation results in cardiac arrest with loss of consciousness and no pulse.<ref name=Bal2016/> This is followed by death in the absence of treatment.<ref name=NIH2011/> Ventricular fibrillation is initially found in about 10% of people with cardiac arrest.<ref name=Bal2016/>
Ventricular fibrillation can occur due to coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome, electric shock, or intracranial hemorrhage.<ref name=NIH2011></ref><ref name=Bal2016/><ref></ref> Diagnosis is by an electrocardiogram (ECG) showing irregular unformed QRS complexes without any clear P waves.<ref name=Bal2016/> An important differential diagnosis is torsades de pointes.<ref name=Bal2016></ref>
Treatment is with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation.<ref name=AHA2015Part1/> Biphasic defibrillation may be better than monophasic.<ref name=AHA2015Part1></ref> The medication epinephrine or amiodarone may be given if initial treatments are not effective.<ref name=Bal2016/> Rates of survival among those who are out of hospital when the arrhythmia is detected is about 17% while in hospital it is about 46%.<ref name=OHCA2010></ref><ref name=Bal2016/>
