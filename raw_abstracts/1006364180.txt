Bohuslän ; ; is a Swedish province in Götaland, on the northernmost part of the country's west coast. It is bordered by Dalsland to the northeast, Västergötland to the southeast, the Skagerrak arm of the North Sea to the west, and the county of Østfold, in Norway, to the north. In English it literally means Bohus County, although it shared counties with the city of Gothenburg prior to the 1998 county merger and thus was not an administrative unit in its own right.
Bohuslän is named after the medieval Norwegian castle of Bohus. Under the name Baahuslen, it was a Norway county from the Norwegian conquest of the region from the Geats and subsequent Unification of Norway in the 870s until the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, when the union of Denmark-Norway was forced to cede this county, as well as Skåneland (part of Denmark proper), to Sweden.
