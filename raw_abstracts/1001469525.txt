Cathay is an names of China for China. During the early modern period, Europeans thought of Cathay as a completely separate and distinct culture from China. As knowledge of East Asia increased, Cathay came to be seen as the same polity as China. The term "Cathay" became a poetic name for China.
The name Cathay originates from the word Khitan<ref></ref> , the name of a nomadic people who founded the Liao dynasty which ruled much of today's Northern China from 916 to 1125, and who later migrated west after they were overthrown by the Jurchens to form the Qara Khitai (also known as the Western Liao) centered on today's Kyrgyzstan for another century thereafter. Originally, this name was the name applied by Central and Western Asians and Europeans to northern China; the name was also used in Marco Polo's book on his travels in China (he referred to southern China as Mangi). Odoric of Pordenone (d.1331) also writes about Cathay and the Khan in his travelbooks from his journey before 1330, perhaps 1321â€“1330.
