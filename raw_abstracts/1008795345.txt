Anthropocentrism ; from , ánthrōpos, "human being"; and , kéntron, "center") is the belief that human beings are the most important entity in the universe. Anthropocentrism interprets or regards the world in terms of human values and experiences.<ref></ref> The term can be used interchangeably with humanocentrism, and some refer to the concept as human supremacy or human exceptionalism. Anthropocentrism is considered to be profoundly embedded in many modern human cultures and conscious acts. It is a major concept in the field of environmental ethics and environmental philosophy, where it is often considered to be the root cause of problems created by human action within the ecosphere.<ref>PhilPapers, Systems Thinking and Universal Dialogue: The Creation of a Noosphere in Today’s Era of Globalization, Author-Martha C.
