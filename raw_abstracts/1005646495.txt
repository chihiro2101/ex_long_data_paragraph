A tradesman, skilled tradesman, or tradie refers to a skilled worker who specializes in a particular occupation that requires work experience, on-the-job training, and often formal vocational education, but not a bachelor's degree.
As opposed to a craftsman or an artisan the occupation of a tradesman is not necessarily restricted to manual work.
