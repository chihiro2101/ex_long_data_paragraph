Tales of quests figure prominently in the folklore of every nation<ref>Josepha Sherman, Once upon a Galaxy p 142 </ref> and ethnic culture. In literature, the object of a quest requires great exertion on the part of the hero, who must overcome many obstacles, typically including much travel. The aspect of travel allows the storyteller to showcase exotic locations and cultures (an objective of the narrative, not of the character).<ref>Michael O. Riley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum, p 178-9, </ref> The object of a quest may also have supernatural properties, often leading the protagonist into other worlds and dimensions. The moral of a quest tale often centers on the changed character of the hero.
