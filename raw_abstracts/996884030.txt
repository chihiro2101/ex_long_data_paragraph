Rushing was known as "Mr. Five by Five" and was the subject of an eponymous 1942 popular song that was a hit for Harry James and others; the lyrics describe Rushing's rotund build: "he's five feet tall and he's five feet wide".<ref name="russell"/> He joined Walter Page's Blue Devils in 1927 and then joined Bennie Moten's band in 1929.<ref name="russell"/> He stayed with the successor Count Basie band when Moten died in 1935.<ref name="russell"/>
Rushing said that his first time singing in front of an audience was in 1924. He was playing piano at a club when the featured singer, Carlyn Williams, invited him to do a vocal. "I got out there and broke it up. I was a singer from then on," he said.<ref name=livin></ref>
Rushing was a powerful singer who had a range from baritone to tenor. He has sometimes been classified as a blues shouter. He could project his voice so that it soared over the horn and reed sections in a big-band setting. Basie claimed that Rushing "never had an equal" as a blues vocalist, though Rushing "really thought of himself as a ballad singer."<ref name= barlow>Barlow, William (1989).

Dave Brubeck defined Rushing's status among blues singers as "the daddy of them all."<ref name=livin /> Late in his life Rushing said of his singing style, "I don't know what kind of blues singer you'd call me.
