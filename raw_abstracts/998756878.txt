Psittacus is a genus of African grey parrots in the subfamily Psittacinae. It contains the two species: the grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) and the Timneh parrot (Psittacus timneh).
For many years, the grey parrot and Timneh parrot were classified as subspecies; the former as the nominate, the latter as P. e. timneh. However, in 2012 the taxa were recognized as separate species by BirdLife International on the basis of genetic, morphological, plumage and vocal differences.<ref></ref><ref name=birdlife></ref>
These parrots are found in the primary and secondary rainforest of West and Central Africa. They are among the most Bird intelligence in the world. They feed primarily on palm nuts, seeds, fruits, and leafy matter, but have also been observed eating snails. Their inclination and ability to mimic speech and other sounds have made them popular pets.
