In English, Western Europe, and some East Asian countries, a homophone is a word that is pronounced the same (to varying extent) as another word but differs in meaning. A homophone may also differ in spelling. The two words may be spelled the same, as in rose (flower) and rose (past tense of rise), or differently, as in rain, reign, and rein. The term "homophone" may also apply to units longer or shorter than words, for example a phrase, letter, or groups of letters which are pronounced the same as another phrase, letter, or group of letters. Any unit with this property is said to be "homophonous".
Homophones that are spelled the same are also both homographs and homonyms, e.g. the word "read," as in the sentence "He is well read," (he is very educated) vs. the sentence "I read that book," (I have finished reading that book.)<ref>According to the strict sense of homonyms as words with the same spelling and pronunciation; however, homonyms according to the loose sense common in nontechnical contexts are words with the same spelling or pronunciation, in which case all homophones are also homonyms. urltoken Random House Unabridged Dictionary entry for "homonym" at Dictionary.com</ref> 
Homophones that are spelled differently are also called heterographs, e.g. to, too, and two.
