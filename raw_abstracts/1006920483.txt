Ijtihad , ; lit. physical or mental effort, expended in a particular activity)<ref name=OEIW></ref> 
is an Islamic legal term referring to independent reasoning<ref name=ODI></ref> 
or the thorough exertion of a jurist's mental faculty in finding a solution to a legal question.<ref name=OEIW/> It is contrasted with taqlid (imitation, conformity to legal precedent).<ref name=ODI/><ref></ref> According to classical Sunni theory, ijtihad requires expertise in the Arabic language, theology, revealed texts, and principles of jurisprudence (usul al-fiqh),<ref name=ODI/> 
and is not employed where authentic and authoritative texts (Qur'an and Hadith) are considered unambiguous with regard to the question, or where there is an existing scholarly consensus (ijma).<ref name=OEIW/> Ijtihad is considered to be a religious duty for those qualified to perform it.<ref name=ODI/> An Islamic scholar who is qualified to perform ijtihad is called a mujtahid.<ref name=OEIW/>
By the beginning of the 10th century, development of Sunni jurisprudence prompted leading Sunni jurists to state that the main legal questions had been addressed and the scope of ijtihad was gradually restricted.<ref name=OEIW/> In the modern era, this gave rise to a perception among Western scholars and lay Muslim public that the so-called "gate of ijtihad" was closed at the start of the classical era.<ref name=OEIW/> While recent scholarship has disproved this notion, the extent and mechanisms of legal change in the post-formative period remain a subject of debate.<ref name=katz/>
Starting from the 18th century, some Muslim reformers began calling for abandonment of taqlid and emphasis on ijtihad, which they saw as a return to Islamic origins.<ref name=OEIW/> Public debates in the Muslim world surrounding ijtihad continue to the present day.<ref name=OEIW/> The advocacy of ijtihad has been particularly associated with Islamic Modernism and purist Salafi thinkers. Among contemporary Muslims in the West there have emerged new visions of ijtihad which emphasize substantive moral values over traditional juridical methodology.<ref name=OEIW/>
Shia jurists did not use the term ijtihad until the 12th century, but they employed a rational mode of legal reasoning from the early period, and its scope was not narrowed as in the Sunni tradition, with the exception of Zaydi jurisprudence.<ref name=OEIW/>
