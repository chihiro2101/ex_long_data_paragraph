Franz Bäke (28 February 1898 – 12 December 1978) was a German officer and tank commander during World War II. He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords of Nazi Germany. In post-war popular culture, Bäke is considered one of the "panzer aces", that is, a highly decorated German tank commander popularised in the English-language translations of German author Franz Kurowski's Panzer Aces series.
