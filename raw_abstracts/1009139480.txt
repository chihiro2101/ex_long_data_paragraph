The Bull Ring is a major shopping centre in central Birmingham. When combined with Grand Central (to which it is connected via a link bridge) it is the United Kingdom's largest city centre based shopping centre and has been an important feature of Birmingham since the Middle Ages, when its market was first held. Two Shopping malls have been built in the area; in the 1960s, and then in 2003; the latter is styled as one word, Bullring.
The site is located on the edge of the Sandstone city ridge which results in the steep gradient towards Digbeth. The slope drops approximately from New Street to St Martin's Church which is very visible near the church.<ref name="Remaking Birmingham"></ref>
The current shopping centre was the busiest in the United Kingdom in 2004 with 36.5 million visitors.<ref></ref> It houses one of only four Selfridges department stores and the fourth largest Debenhams in the UK.
