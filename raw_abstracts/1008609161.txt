In geology, a fault is a planar fracture or discontinuity in a volume of rock across which there has been significant displacement as a result of rock-mass movements. Large faults within the Earth's crust result from the action of plate tectonic forces, with the largest forming the boundaries between the plates, such as subduction or transform faults.<ref></ref> Energy release associated with rapid movement on active faults is the cause of most earthquakes. Faults may also displace slowly, by aseismic creep.<ref name="Ohnaka"></ref>
A fault plane is the plane that represents the fracture surface of a fault. A fault trace or fault line is a place where the fault can be seen or mapped on the surface. A fault trace is also the line commonly plotted on geologic maps to represent a fault.<ref></ref><ref>.</ref>
A fault zone is a cluster of parallel faults.<ref> urltoken zone.‚Äù Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, Merriam-Webster.
