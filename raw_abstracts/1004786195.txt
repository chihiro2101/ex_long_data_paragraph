In South Korea, section 37 of the Family Registry Law requires that the hanja in personal names be taken from a restricted list.<ref>South Korea, Family Register Law</ref> Unapproved hanja must be represented by hangul in the family registry. In March 1991, the Supreme Court of South Korea published the Table of Hanja for Personal Name Use, which allowed a total of 2,854 hanja in new South Korean given names (as well as 61 alternative forms).<ref> urltoken National Academy of the Korean Language (1991) </ref> The list was expanded in 1994, 1997, 2001, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2013 and 2015. Thus, 8,142 hanja are now permitted in South Korean names (including the set of basic hanja), in addition to a small number of alternative forms.<ref></ref> The use of an official list is similar to Japan's use of the jinmeiyō kanji (although the characters do not entirely coincide).
While the traditional practice is still largely followed, since the late 1970s, some parents have given their children names that are native Korean words, usually of two syllables. Popular given names of this sort include Haneul ; "Heaven" or "Sky"), Areum ; "Beauty"), Iseul ; "Dew") and Seulgi ; "Wisdom").<ref></ref> Between 2008 and 2015, the proportion of such names among South Korean newborns rose from 3.5% to 7.7%. The most popular such names in 2015 were Han-gyeol (한결; "Consistent, Unchanging") for boys and Sarang ; "Love") for girls.<ref></ref> Despite this trend away from traditional practice, people's names are still recorded in both hangul and hanja (if available) on official documents, in family genealogies, and so on.
Originally, there was no legal limitation on the length of names in South Korea. As a result, some people registered extremely long given names composed of native Korean words, such as the 16-syllable Haneulbyeollimgureumhaennimbodasarangseureouri ; roughly, "More beloved than the stars in the sky and the sun in the clouds"). However, beginning in 1993, new regulations required that the given name be five syllables or shorter.<ref></ref>
