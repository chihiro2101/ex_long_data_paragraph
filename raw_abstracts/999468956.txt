An inquisitorial system is a legal system in which the court, or a part of the court, is actively involved in investigating the facts of the case. This is distinct from an adversarial system, in which the role of the court is primarily that of an impartial referee between the prosecution and the defense. Inquisitorial systems are used primarily in countries with civil legal systems, such as France and Italy, or legal systems based on Sharia like Saudi Arabia,<ref>Dammer ,Harry R. and Albanese Jay S.; Comparative Criminal Justice Systems, p. 149 </ref> rather than in common law systems. 
Countries using common law, including the United States, may use an inquisitorial system for summary hearings in the case of misdemeanors or infractions, such as minor traffic violations. The distinction between an adversarial and inquisitorial system is theoretically unrelated to the distinction between a civil legal and common-law system. Some legal scholars consider inquisitorial misleading, and prefer the word nonadversarial.<ref>Glendon MA, Carozza PG, Picker CB. (2008) Comparative Legal Traditions, p. 101.
