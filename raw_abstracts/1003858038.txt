McDonaldland is a fantasy world used in the marketing for McDonald's restaurants during the 1970s through the 1990s. McDonaldland is inhabited by Ronald McDonald and other characters. In addition to being used in advertising, the characters were used as the basis for equipment in the "PlayPlaces" attached to some McDonald's outlets. The McDonaldland commercials featuring the characters were dropped from McDonald's advertising in 2003, but Ronald McDonald is still seen in commercials and in Happy Meal toys.
