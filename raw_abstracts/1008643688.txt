MSX is a standardized home computer architecture, announced by Microsoft and ASCII Corporation on June 16, 1983.<ref></ref><ref></ref> It was initially conceived by Microsoft as a product for the Eastern sector, and jointly marketed by Kazuhiko Nishi, then vice-president at Microsoft and director at ASCII Corporation.<ref></ref> Microsoft and Nishi conceived the project as an attempt to create unified standards among various home computing system manufacturers of the period, in the same fashion as the VHS standard for home video tape machines.<ref></ref><ref> urltoken Kazuhiko Nishi - eNotes.com Reference.</ref>
MSX systems were popular in Japan and several other countries. Sony was the primary manufacturer of MSX systems at the time of release, and throughout most of the products’ lifespan, producing more units than any other manufacturer. Eventually 5&nbsp;million MSX-based units were sold in Japan alone. Despite Microsoft’s involvement, few MSX-based machines were released in the United States.<ref> urltoken Faceoff: will MSX be a success in the United States.</ref>
The meaning of the acronym MSX remains a matter of debate. In 2001, Kazuhiko Nishi recalled that many assumed that it was derived from “Microsoft Extended”, referring to the built-in Microsoft Extended BASIC (MSX BASIC). Others believed that it stood for "Matsushita-Sony". Nishi said that the team’s original definition was "Machines with Software eXchangeability",<ref></ref> although in 1985 he said it was named after the MX missile.<ref></ref> According to his book in 2020, he considered the name of the new standard should consist of three letters like VHS. He felt "MSX" was fit because it means "the next of Microsoft", and it also contains first letters of Matsushita (Panasonic) and Sony.<ref name="Nishi_2020"></ref>
Before the success of Nintendo’s Family Computer, MSX was the platform for which major Japanese game studios such as Konami and Hudson Soft produced video games. The Metal Gear series, for example, was first written for MSX hardware.<ref></ref>
