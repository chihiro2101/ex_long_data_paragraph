A towel is a piece of absorbent cloth or paper used for drying or wiping a body or a surface. It draws moisture through direct contact.
In households, several types of fabric towels are used, including hand towels, bath towels and kitchen towels. At the beach, people use beach towels.
Paper towels are provided in commercial or office bathrooms via a dispenser for users to dry their hands. In households they are used for minor, precision, or particularly dirty jobs of wiping, cleaning, and drying.<ref></ref>
