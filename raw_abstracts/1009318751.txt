The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is a hypothesis in financial economics that states that asset prices reflect all available information. A direct implication is that it is impossible to "beat the market" consistently on a risk-adjusted basis since market prices should only react to new information.
Because the EMH is formulated in terms of risk adjustment, it only makes testable predictions when coupled with a particular model of risk.<ref name=":1"></ref> As a result, research in financial economics since at least the 1990s has focused on Market anomaly, that is, deviations from specific models of risk.<ref></ref> The idea that financial market returns are difficult to predict goes back to Bachelier (1900),<ref></ref> Mandelbrot (1963),<ref></ref> and Samuelson (1965),<ref></ref> but is closely associated with Eugene Fama, in part due to his influential 1970 review of the theoretical and empirical research (Fama 1970).<ref name=":1" /> The EMH provides the basic logic for modern risk-based theories of asset prices, and frameworks such as consumption-based asset pricing and intermediary asset pricing can be thought of as the combination of a model of risk with the EMH.<ref name=":0"></ref>
