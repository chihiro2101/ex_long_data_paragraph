Terence James Cooke (March 1, 1921 â€“ October 6, 1983) was an American cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of New York from 1968 until his death, quietly battling leukemia throughout his tenure. He was named a cardinal in 1969. Nine years after his death, he was designated a Servant of God, the first step in the process that leads to beatification and then canonization as a saint.
