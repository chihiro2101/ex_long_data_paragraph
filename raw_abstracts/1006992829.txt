Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, 1st Count Jourdan (29 April 1762 â€“ 23 November 1833), was a French military commander who enlisted as a private in the French Royal Army, before rising to command armies during the French Revolutionary Wars. He was made a Marshal of the Empire by Emperor Napoleon in 1804 and he also fought in the Napoleonic Wars. After 1815, he became reconciled to the Bourbon Restoration. Jourdan was one of the most successful commanders of the French Revolutionary Army, but is notable for his decisive defeat at the Battle of Vitoria which resulted in the French Empire's permanent loss of Spain.
