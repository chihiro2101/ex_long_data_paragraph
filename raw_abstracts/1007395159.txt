Around 767 he came to Tibet and helped construct Samye Monastery, the first Buddhist and Nyingma monastery in Tibet. Padmasambhava then revealed the Vajrayana of Tibetan Buddhism, with scholars, translators, and masters.<ref name=tthr></ref> His students in Tibet include the great master Yeshe Tsogyal and the "Twenty-Five King and Subjects".<ref name="Schaik 2011, page 34-5">Schaik, Sam van.

A number of biographies describe Padmasambhava's life and deeds. The Nyingma scholar Palden Sherab explains of his birth: 
In addition to the Nyingma school, Padmasambhava is also widely venerated as a second Buddha by Buddhists in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, the Himalayan states of India, and in countries around the world.<ref name=EB></ref><ref name=princeton></ref> Buddha Shakyamuni predicted Padmasambhava's coming and activities in 19 Sutras and Tantras, stating he would be an emanation of Amitaba and
Avalokiteśvara. Other accounts maintain Padmasambhava is a direct reincarnation of Buddha Shakyamuni.
For the most part, Buddha Shakyamuni taught Hinayana and Sutra Mahayana, and only taught Vajrayana to select students privately. As a reincarnation, Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche states that Padmasambhava "revealed the Vajrayana teachings in their entirety."<ref name=KPSR8/> The Vajrayana is also known as Tantra, and is based on the Mahayana.
In Tibetan Buddhism, the Vajrayana revealed by Padmasambhava has an oral Kama lineage, and a hidden treasure Terma lineage that was founded by Padmasambhava and Yeshe Tsogyal.<ref name=Khenchen/> The Terma are discovered by fortunate beings and tertön when conditions are ripe for reception. The Nyingma Dzogchen lineage has its origins in Garab Dorje through a direct transmission to Padmasambhava.<ref name=KPSR/>
Padmasambhava appears to Tertöns in visionary encounters, and his form is visualized during guru yoga practice, particularly in the Nyingma school. The Nyingma school considers Padmasambhava to be a founder of their tradition.<ref></ref> Padmasambhava established Vajrayana Buddhism and the highest forms of Dzogchen (Mengagde) in Tibet and transformed the entire nation.
