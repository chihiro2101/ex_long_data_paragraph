Activities of daily living (ADLs or ADL) is a term used in healthcare to refer to people's daily self-care activities. The concept of ADLs was originally proposed in the 1950s by Sidney Katz and his team at the Benjamin Rose Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio and has been added to and refined by a variety of researchers since that time.<ref></ref> Health professionals often use a person's ability or inability to perform ADLs as a measurement of their functional status, particularly in regard to people post injury, with Disability and the Old age.<ref name=EN>"Activities of Daily Living Evaluation."

Common ADLs include feeding ourselves, bathing, dressing, grooming, work, homemaking, cleaning oneself after defecating and leisure.<ref name =MN> urltoken MedicineNet.com Medical Dictionary</ref> A number of national surveys collect data on the ADL status of the U.S. population.<ref name =NCHS> urltoken United States Census</ref> While basic definitions of ADLs have been suggested, what specifically constitutes a particular ADL for each individual may vary. Adaptive equipment and devices may be used to enhance and increase independence in performing ADLs.
ADLs refer to the most basic functions of living. The first sentence in the previous paragraph ends with "leisure,<ref name =MN> urltoken MedicineNet.com Medical Dictionary</ref> " or more completely "ability to make use of leisure." It usually is easy to make the binary choice YES/NO as regards "can someone feed themselves," though even here there are graduations. However, the question "can someone make good use of leisure?" does not easily lead to a binary choice YES/NO, and so the measurement of "leisure" is very problematic. "Employability" is even more problematic. Clearly quantifiable ADLs refer to very basic skills, while "quality of life" variables have not yet been quantified.
