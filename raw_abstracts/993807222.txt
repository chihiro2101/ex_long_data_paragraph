Riddim is the Jamaican Patois pronunciation of the English word "rhythm". In reggae, dancehall, calypso, soca, grime, and reggaeton parlance it refers to the instrumental accompaniment to a song. These genres consist of the riddim plus the "voicing" (vocal part) sung by the deejay. The resulting song structure is distinctive in many ways. A given riddim, if popular, may be used in dozens—or even hundreds—of songs, not only in recordings but also in live performances.
Since the 1970s, riddims have accompanied reggae music and through the 1980s, more widely known as dancehall. As seen in dancehall music, there is a voicing part – sung by the DJ – over some riddim that has probably been widely used in many other songs. There is a unique establishment in the combination of riddims and voicing. This redistribution of riddims creates a complexity of diasporic transference through the constant re-versions which could be comparable to hip-hop’s use of sampling. The situation is certainly different from U.S. hip-hop as the redistribution of riddims is relative to the Jamaican culture that relied heavily on sound systems and studio production. With redistribution, there has been a tricky history with copyright laws in Jamaica. Since the culture heavily relied on sound systems and vinyl records since the early beginning, there was not a heavy implementation of copyright protections. Throughout the 70s and 80s, there still remained no formal copyright system, as the work of producers on various records remained often anonymous.
By 1993, Jamaica finally established a copyright act, but producers still face difficulty in establishing profit. Through proper registration, many artists now work on negotiating their royalties and taking it more seriously. The unique nature of dancehall and riddims have been highly influential on the numerous remixes that now circulate R&B and hip-hop music.
