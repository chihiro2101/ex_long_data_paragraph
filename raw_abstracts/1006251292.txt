Peer pressure is the direct influence on people by peers, or the effect on an individual who is encouraged and wants to follow their peers by changing their attitudes, values or behaviors to conform to those of the influencing group or individual. For the individual, this can result in either a positive or negative effect, or both. Social groups affected include both membership groups - in which individuals are "formally" members (such as political parties, trade unions, schools) - and cliques - in which membership is not clearly defined. However, a person does not need to be a member or be seeking membership of a group to be affected by peer pressure. 
Researchers have studied the effects of peer pressure on children and on adolescents, and in popular discourse the term "peer pressure" occurs mostly with reference to those age-groups. For children, the common themes for study regard their abilities for independent decision-making; for adolescents, peer pressure's relationship with sexual intercourse and substance abuse have been significantly researched. Peer pressure can affect individuals of all ethnicities, genders and ages, however. Peer pressure has expanded from strictly face-to-face interaction to digital interaction as well. Social media offers opportunities for adolescents and adults alike to instil and/or experience pressure every day.<ref></ref> Research suggests that not just individuals but also organizations, such as large corporations, are susceptible to peer pressures, such as pressures from other firms in their industry or from headquarters.<ref name=":5">
