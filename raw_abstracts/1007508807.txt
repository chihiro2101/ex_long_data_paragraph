A rite of passage is a ceremony or ritual of the passage which occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another. It involves a significant change of social status. In cultural anthropology the term is the Anglicisation of rite de passage, a French term innovated by the Ethnography Arnold van Gennep in his work Les rites de passage, "The Rites of Passage".<ref></ref> The term is now fully adopted into anthropology as well as into the literature and popular cultures of many modern languages.
