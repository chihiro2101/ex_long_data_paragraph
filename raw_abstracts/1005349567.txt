Most of the settlements on the Levels are small villages. In the south, Aller, which has a population of 374,<ref></ref> includes the hamlet of Beer (sometimes Bere) and the deserted medieval village of Oath on the opposite bank of the River Parrett. The area known as the Isle of Athelney was once a very low isolated island linked by a causeway to East Lyng, each end of which was protected by a semi-circular stockade and ditch. The ditch on the island is now known to date from the Iron Age, and was used by Alfred the Great as a fort before the Battle of Ethandun in May 878; in gratitude for his victory Alfred founded a monastery, Athelney Abbey,<ref></ref> on the Isle in 888, which survived until the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII in 1539. Bawdrip is a small village which has a population of 498.<ref name="sedgecensus"></ref> Brent Knoll is a large village at the foot of Brent Knoll Camp that dominates the surrounding landscape; the name means Beacon Hill in Old English.<ref></ref> Brent Knoll has been inhabited since at least the Bronze Age.<ref></ref> Before the Somerset Levels were drained, Brent Knoll was an island known as the Isle (or Mount) of Frogs.<ref></ref>
Glastonbury (population 8,784)<ref name="mendipcensus"></ref> and Street (11,066)<ref name="mendipcensus"/> lie on opposite sides of the River Brue, and provide a central point for trade and commerce. Larger centres are generally on slightly higher ground around the edges of the Levels. Bridgwater is a market town, the administrative centre of the Sedgemoor district, and a major industrial centre. With a population of 33,698,<ref name="sedgecensus"/> it straddles the major communication routes through South West England. Situated on the edge of the Somerset Levels, along both banks of the River Parrett and from its mouth, it was at one time a major port and trading centre. The hamlet of Dunball forms part of the port on the river. Burrowbridge lies on the River Parrett further inland. The name probably comes from the Old English (fortified hill) and (bridge).<ref></ref> In the village is Burrow Mump, an ancient earthwork now owned by the National Trust. Burrow Mump is also known as St Michael's Borough or Tutteyate.<ref></ref> It is a natural hill of Triassic sandstone capped by Keuper marl.<ref></ref> Excavations showed evidence of a medieval masonry building on the top of the hill.<ref></ref>
Along the coast, settlements such as Berrow are built on the line of sand dunes separating the low-lying marshes from the Bristol Channel. At the northern end Bleadon lies on the River Axe; and there was for many years a small harbour, sometimes known as Lympsham Wharf.<ref name="farr-88-90"></ref> The arrival of the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1841, which crossed the Axe on a bridge, obstructed river traffic beyond the wharf, making it the limit of navigation for coastal vessels.<ref name="farr-88-90"/> An Act of 1915 authorised the drainage of the river and installation of a flood gate at Bleadon,<ref></ref> although attempts to control the water had occurred on Bleadon Level since medieval times, including an early windmill, in 1613, to pump water into the sea from behind a sea wall.<ref></ref> Burnham-on-Sea (population 18,401)<ref></ref> is at the mouth of the River Parrett where it enters Bridgwater Bay.<ref name="OS182"></ref> The position of the town on the edge of the Somerset Levels has resulted in a history dominated by land reclamation and sea defences since Roman times.<ref></ref> Burnham was seriously affected by the Bristol Channel floods, 1607, and various flood defences have been installed since then.<ref></ref> A concrete sea wall was built in 1911, and after the Second World War further additions to the defences were made, using the remains of a Mulberry harbour; the present curved concrete wall was completed in 1988.<ref></ref> Highbridge, which neighbours Burnham, is near the mouth of the River Brue and the villages of East and West Huntspill.<ref name="OS182"/>
