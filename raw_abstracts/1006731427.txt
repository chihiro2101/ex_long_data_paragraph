The Field of the Cloth of Gold , was a royal summit meeting at a site in Balinghem equidistant between Ardres in France and Gu√Ænes in the English Pale of Calais. It was a lavish extremely expensive display of wealth on both sides from 7 to 24 June 1520, between King Henry VIII of England and King Francis I of France.<ref>Glenn Richardson, "Field of the Cloth of Gold" History Today (July 2020) 7#7 pp 28-39. </ref>
The summit was arranged to increase the bond of friendship between the two kings following the Anglo-French treaty of 1514. These two monarchs would meet again in 1532 to arrange Francis's assistance in pressuring Pope Clement VII to pronounce Henry's first marriage as illegitimate. Under the guidance of English Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, the chief nations of Europe sought to outlaw war forever among Christian nations.
The site is indicated by a commemorative plaque on the D231 road (Route de Marquise). Though now in France, Balinghem was at the time regarded as Pale of Calais. This caused some tensions between the English and French, as the latter preferred a location closer to the border, but topographical considerations proved the decisive factor.<ref></ref>
