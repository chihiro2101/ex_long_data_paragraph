The Oak Ridge Boys are an American country and gospel vocal quartet. The group was founded in the 1940s as the Oak Ridge Quartet. They became popular in southern gospel during the 1950s. Their name was changed to the Oak Ridge Boys in the early 1960s, and they remained a gospel group until the mid-1970s, when they changed their image and concentrated on country music.<ref name="oak_ridge_boys_2015_hall_of_fame">Carter, Walter: urltoken "Oak Ridge Boys: Inducted 2015,", 2015, (adapted from the Country Music Hall of Fame® and Museum's Encyclopedia of Country Music, Oxford University Press) Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, retrieved September 6, 2020</ref><ref name="hall_of_fame_inductees_2015_10_25"> urltoken "Country Music Hall Of Fame Inductees: Jim Ed Brown And The Browns, Grady Martin, Oak Ridge Boys,", Oct 25, 2015, Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, retrieved September 6, 2020</ref>
The lineup which produced their most well-known country and crossover hits (such as "Elvira" (1981), "Bobbie Sue" (1982), and "American Made" (1983) consists of Duane Allen (lead), Joe Bonsall (tenor), William Lee Golden (baritone), and Richard Sterban (bass). Golden and Allen joined the group in the mid-1960s, and Sterban and Bonsall joined in the early 1970s. Aside from an eight-year gap (1987–95) when Golden left the group and was replaced, this lineup has been together since 1973 and continues to tour and record.
