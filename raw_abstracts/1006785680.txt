Pocahontas was captured and held for ransom by the Colonists during hostilities in 1613. During her captivity, she was encouraged to convert to Christianity and was baptized under the name Rebecca. She married tobacco planter John Rolfe in April 1614 aged about 17 or 18, and she bore their son Thomas Rolfe in January 1615.<ref name="Stebbins 2010"></ref>
In 1616, the Rolfes travelled to London where Pocahontas was presented to English society as an example of the Noble savage in hopes of stimulating investment in the Jamestown settlement. On this trip she may have met Squanto, a Patuxet from New England.<ref></ref> She became something of a celebrity, was elegantly fêted, and attended a masque at Whitehall Palace. In 1617, the Rolfes set sail for Virginia, but Pocahontas died at Gravesend of unknown causes, aged 20 or 21. She was buried in St George's Church, Gravesend, in England, but her grave's exact location is unknown because the church was rebuilt after a fire destroyed it.<ref name="Stebbins 2010"/>
