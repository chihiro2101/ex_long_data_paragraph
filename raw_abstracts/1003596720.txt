Very low frequency or VLF is the ITU designation<ref name="ITU Nomenclature"></ref> for Radio frequency (RF) in the range of 3â€“30&nbsp;kHz, corresponding to wavelengths from 100 to 10&nbsp;km, respectively. The band is also known as the myriameter band or myriameter wave as the wavelengths range from one to ten myriameters (an obsolete metric unit equal to 10&nbsp;kilometers). Due to its limited bandwidth, audio (voice) transmission is highly impractical in this band, and therefore only low data rate coded signals are used. The VLF band is used for a few radio navigation services, government Time signal (broadcasting time signals to set radio clocks) and for secure military communication. Since VLF waves can penetrate at least 40&nbsp;meters (131&nbsp;ft) into saltwater, they are used for military communication with submarines.
