Diodotus I Soter (Greek: ; epithet means "the Saviour"; c. 285&nbsp;BC â€“ c. 235 BC) was Seleucid satrap of Bactria. Diodotus became independent of the Seleucids empire around 255 or 245 BC, and established the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, which endured in various forms until the beginning of the first century AD. As ruler, he is known to have pursued hostilities with the Parthians and to have minted coinage with his own image but not in his own name. He died around 235 BC and was succeeded by his son, Diodotus II.
Diodotus' career was recounted by Apollodorus of Artemita in the Parthian History, but this text is lost, and surviving literary sources only mention him in passing.<ref></ref> Thus, most details of Diodotus' life and career have to be reconstructed from numismatics.
