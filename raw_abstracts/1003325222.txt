In electronics a relaxation oscillator is a nonlinear electronic oscillator circuit that produces a nonsinusoidal repetitive output signal, such as a triangle wave or square wave.<ref name="Graf"></ref><ref name="Edson"> on Peter Millet's urltoken Tubebooks website</ref><ref name=" Morris"></ref><ref name="Du"></ref> The circuit consists of a feedback loop containing a switching device such as a transistor, comparator, relay,<ref name="Varigonda"></ref> op amp, or a negative resistance device like a tunnel diode, that repetitively charges a capacitor or inductor through a resistance until it reaches a threshold level, then discharges it again.<ref name="Du" /><ref name="HyperPhysics"></ref> The period of the oscillator depends on the time constant of the capacitor or inductor circuit.<ref name="Edson" /> The active device switches abruptly between charging and discharging modes, and thus produces a discontinuously changing repetitive waveform.<ref name="Edson" /><ref name="Du" /> This contrasts with the other type of electronic oscillator, the harmonic or linear oscillator, which uses an amplifier with feedback to excite resonant oscillations in a resonator, producing a sine wave.<ref name="Oliveira"></ref> Relaxation oscillators are used to produce low frequency signals for applications such as blinking lights (turn signals) and Buzzer and in voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs), inverters and Switching power supply, dual-slope ADCs, and function generators.
The term relaxation oscillator is also applied to dynamical systems in many diverse areas of science that produce nonlinear oscillations and can be analyzed using the same mathematical model as electronic relaxation oscillators.<ref name="Wang"></ref><ref name="Sauro">,</ref><ref name="Letellier1"></ref><ref name="Ginoux1"></ref> For example, geothermal geysers,<ref name="Enns"></ref><ref name="Pippard"></ref> networks of firing nerve cells,<ref name="Ginoux1" /> thermostat controlled heating systems,<ref name="Pippard1"> urltoken Pippard, The Physics of Vibration, p. 41-42</ref> coupled chemical reactions,<ref name="Sauro" /> the beating human heart,<ref name="Ginoux1" /><ref name="Pippard1" /> earthquakes,<ref name="Enns" /> the squeaking of chalk on a blackboard,<ref name="Pippard1" /> the cyclic populations of predator and prey animals, and gene activation systems<ref name="Sauro" /> have been modeled as relaxation oscillators. Relaxation oscillations are characterized by two alternating processes on different time scales: a long relaxation period during which the system approaches an equilibrium point, alternating with a short impulsive period in which the equilibrium point shifts.<ref name="Ginoux1" /><ref name="Enns" /><ref name="Pippard" /><ref name="Kinoshita"></ref> The period of a relaxation oscillator is mainly determined by the relaxation time constant.<ref name="Ginoux1" /> Relaxation oscillations are a type of limit cycle and are studied in nonlinear control theory.<ref name="Leigh">see Ch. 9, "Limit cycles and relaxation oscillations" in </ref>
