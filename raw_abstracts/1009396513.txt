The Eddystone Lighthouse is a lighthouse that is located on the dangerous Eddystone Rocks, south of Rame Head in England. While Rame Head is in Cornwall, the rocks are submerged below the surface of the sea <ref>Ordnance Survey mapping; the rocks form part of the unitary district of the City of Plymouth, in the ceremonial county of Devon</ref> and composed of Precambrian gneiss.<ref name=osinfo> View at 1:50000 scale</ref>
The current structure is the fifth to be built on the site. The first was taken down after only a year of use due to harsh conditions. The second tower was swept away in a powerful storm, killing its architect and five other men in the process. The third burned down. The fourth, also known as Smeaton's Tower, is the best known because of its influence on Lighthouse and its importance in the development of concrete for building. Its upper portions have been re-erected in Plymouth as a monument.<ref name=thinfo></ref> The first lighthouse, completed in 1699, was the world's first open ocean lighthouse, although the Cordouan Lighthouse off the western French coast preceded it as the first offshore lighthouse.<ref name="Winstanley"></ref>
