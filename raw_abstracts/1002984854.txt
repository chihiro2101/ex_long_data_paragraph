A dip pen or nib pen or pen nib usually consists of a metal nib with capillary action like those of fountain pen nibs, mounted in a handle or holder, often made of wood. Other materials can be used for the holder, including bone, metal and plastic; some pens are made entirely of glass. 
Generally, dip pens have no ink reservoir, so the user must recharge the ink from an ink bowl or bottle to continue drawing or writing. There are simple, tiny tubular reservoirs that illustrators sometimes clip onto dip pens, which allow drawing for several minutes without recharging the nib. Recharging can be done by dipping into an inkwell, but it is also possible to charge the pen with an eyedropper, a syringe, or a brush, which gives more control over the amount of ink applied. Thus, "dip pens" are not necessarily dipped; many illustrators call them "nib pens".
Dip pens emerged in the early 19th century, when they replaced quill pens and,<ref name=book></ref> in some parts of the world, reed pens. Dip pens were generally used before the development of fountain pens in the later 19th century,<ref name=bjq> urltoken More about the pen trade on Birmingham Jewellery Quarter</ref> and are now mainly used in illustration, calligraphy, and comics.
The dip pen has certain advantages over a fountain pen. It can use waterproof, pigmented, particle-and-binder-based inks, such as India ink, drawing ink, and acrylic inks—each of which would destroy a fountain pen by clogging it—and the traditional iron gall ink, which can corrode fountain pens. Dip pens are also more sensitive to variations of pressure and speed, producing a line that naturally varies in thickness; and they can also produce a finer line than any fountain pen.<ref name=bestnibs> urltoken The Best Nib and Nib Holder Combinations by Miriam on Jet Pens, March 12, 2019</ref>
There is a wide range of exchangeable nibs for dip pens, so different types of lines and effects can be created. The nibs and handles are far cheaper than most fountain pens, and allow color changes much more easily.<ref name=bestnibs/>
