Ira Samuel Einhorn (May 15, 1940&nbsp;– April 3, 2020), known as "The Unicorn Killer", was a convicted murderer and American environmental activist. He was convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend, Holly Maddux. On September 9, 1977, Maddux disappeared following a trip to collect her belongings from the apartment she and Einhorn had shared in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Eighteen months later, police found her partially mummified body in a trunk in Einhorn's closet.<ref name=compost></ref>
After his arrest, Einhorn fled the country and spent twenty-three years in Europe before being extradited to the United States. He took the stand in his own defense, claiming his ex-girlfriend had been killed by CIA agents who framed him for the crime because he knew too much about the agency's paranormal military research. He was convicted and served a life sentence until his death in prison in April 2020.<ref name=compost/><ref></ref>
His nickname, "the Unicorn", comes from the surname Einhorn, which means "unicorn" in German.
On 3 April 2020, Einhorn, aged 79, died in the State Correctional Institution – Laurel Highlands.
