Edgware Road is a major road in London, England. The route originated as part of Roman Watling Street, and, unusually for London, runs for 10 miles in an almost perfect straight line. It is part of the modern A5 road. 
 
The road runs runs from central to suburban London, beginning at Marble Arch in the City of Westminster and heading north to Edgware in the London Borough of Barnet. It is used as the boundary for four London boroughs: Harrow and Brent to the west, and Barnet and Camden to the east.
 
The road undergoes several name changes along its length, including Maida Vale, Kilburn High Road, Shoot Up Hill and Cricklewood Broadway; but the road is, as a whole, known as the Edgware Road, as it is the road to Edgware.
