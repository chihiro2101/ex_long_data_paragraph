Image:Perovskite.jpg|thumb|Structure of a perovskite with general chemical formula ABX<sub>3</sub>. The red spheres are X atoms (usually oxygens), the blue spheres are B atoms (a smaller metal cation, such as Ti<sup>4+</sup>), and the green spheres are the A atoms (a larger metal cation, such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>). Pictured is the undistorted cubic structure; the symmetry is lowered to orthorhombic, tetragonal or trigonal in many perovskites.<ref></ref>
A perovskite is any material with a crystal structure similar to the Perovskite, which consists of calcium titanium oxide (CaTiO<sub>3</sub>).<ref name="Min"></ref> The mineral was first discovered in the Ural mountains of Russia by Gustav Rose in 1839 and named after Russian mineralogist L. A. Perovski (1792â€“1856). The general chemical formula for perovskite compounds is ABX<sub>3</sub>, where 'A' and 'B' are two cations, often of very different sizes, and X is an anion (frequently oxide) that bonds to both cations. The 'A' atoms are generally larger than the 'B' atoms. The ideal cubic structure has the B cation in 6-fold coordination, surrounded by an octahedron of anions, and the A cation in 12-fold cuboctahedron coordination.
As one of the most abundant structural families, perovskites are found in an enormous number of compounds which have wide-ranging properties, applications and importance.<ref></ref> Natural compounds with this structure are perovskite, loparite, and the silicate perovskite bridgmanite.<ref name="Min"/><ref name=Mindat> urltoken Bridgemanite on Mindat.org</ref> Since the discovery of Perovskite solar cell, which contain methylammonium lead halide perovskites in 2009 there has been considerable research interest into perovskite materials.<ref></ref>
