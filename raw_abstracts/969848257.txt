Nectocaris pteryx is a species of possible cephalopod<ref name=SmithAndCaron2010/> known from the "early Cambrian" (Series 2) Emu Bay Shale and Chengjiang biota, the "middle Cambrian" (Wuliuan) Burgess Shale.
Nectocaris was a free-swimming, predatory or scavenging organism. This lifestyle is reflected in its binomial name: Nectocaris means "swimming shrimp" (from the Ancient Greek , , meaning "swimmer" and , , "shrimp"; , , means "wing"). Two morphs are known: a small morph, about an inch long, and a large morph, anatomically identical but around four times longer.<ref name="Smith2013c"/>
The closely related Ordovician taxon Nectocotis is a second genus, closely resembling Nectocaris, but possessing an internal skeletal element.<ref name=Smith2019></ref>
