Only When I Laugh is a 1981 American comedy-drama based on Neil Simon's 1970 play The Gingerbread Lady.
The story is about an alcoholic Broadway actress who tries to stay sober, while dealing with the problems of her teenaged daughter and her friends: a vain woman who fears the loss of her looks, and a gay actor relegated to small roles in third-rate shows. Simon changed the main character's name to Georgia Hines for the film adaptation; the character was named Evy Meara in the stage version. The main character went from being a cabaret singer to a Broadway stage actress.
The film, written by Simon and directed by Glenn Jordan, stars Marsha Mason, Joan Hackett, James Coco, and Kristy McNichol. It also features two short scenes with then-unknowns Kevin Bacon and John Vargas. Simon's next release, I Ought to Be in Pictures, was released just six months later, and its plot was similar.
It was nominated for Academy Awards for Academy Award for Best Actress (Marsha Mason), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (James Coco), and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Joan Hackett). Only When I Laugh proved to be very successful at the box office.
Coco was also nominated for Worst Supporting Actor in Golden Raspberry Awards for the same role.
