A pH meter is a scientific instrument that measures the hydrogen-ion activity in Aqueous solution, indicating its acidity or alkalinity expressed as pH.<ref name="EB"></ref> The pH meter measures the difference in electrical potential between a pH electrode and a reference electrode, and so the pH meter is sometimes referred to as a "potentiometric pH meter". The difference in electrical potential relates to the acidity or pH of the solution.<ref>Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (2 ed.), ed.
