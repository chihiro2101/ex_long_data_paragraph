OpenDoc is a defunct multi-platform software componentry framework standard created by Apple in the 1990s for compound documents, intended as an alternative to Microsoft's Object Linking and Embedding (OLE).<ref name="appleWordperfectAnnounce"></ref> As part of the AIM alliance between Apple, IBM, and Motorola, OpenDoc is one of Apple's earliest experiments with open standards and collaborative development methods with other companieseffectively starting an industry consortium. Active development was discontinued in March 1997.<ref name=cnet97 /><ref name=techCrunch97 />
The core idea of OpenDoc is to create small, reusable components, responsible for a specific task, such as text editing, bitmap editing, or browsing an FTP server. OpenDoc provides a framework in which these components can run together, and a document format for storing the data created by each component. These documents can then be opened on other machines, where the OpenDoc frameworks substitute suitable components for each part, even if they are from different vendors.<ref></ref> In this way users can "build up" their documents from parts. Since there is no main application and the only visible interface is the document itself, the system is known as document-centered.<ref></ref>
At its inception, it was envisioned that OpenDoc would allow, for example, smaller, third-party developers to enter the then-competitive office suite software market, able to build one good editor instead of having to provide a complete suite.<ref></ref>
