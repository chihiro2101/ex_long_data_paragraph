The United States public's opinion on the invasion of Iraq has changed significantly since the years preceding the incursion. For various reasons, mostly related to the unexpected consequences of the invasion, as well as misinformation provided by US authorities, the US public's perspective on its government's choice to initiate an offensive is increasingly negative. Before the invasion in March 2003, polls showed 47â€“60% of the US public supported an invasion, dependent on U.N. approval.<ref name="usatoday2003"></ref> According to the same poll retaken in April 2007, 58% of the participants stated that the initial attack was a mistake.<ref name="Polling Report">
