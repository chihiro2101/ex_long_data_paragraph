Hyponatremia is a low sodium concentration in the blood.<ref name=CMAJ2014/> It is generally defined as a sodium concentration of less than 135 mmol/L (135 mEq/L), with severe hyponatremia being below 120 mEq/L.<ref name=Ann2015/><ref></ref> Symptoms can be absent, mild or severe.<ref name=Wil2016/><ref name=Endo2010/> Mild symptoms include a decreased ability to think, headaches, nausea, and poor balance.<ref name="babar" /><ref name=Ann2015></ref> Severe symptoms include confusion, seizures, and coma.<ref name="babar" /><ref name=Wil2016></ref><ref name=Endo2010></ref>
The causes of hyponatremia are typically classified by a person's body fluid status into low volume, normal volume, or high volume.<ref name=CMAJ2014/> Low volume hyponatremia can occur from diarrhea, vomiting, diuretics, and sweating.<ref name=CMAJ2014/> Normal volume hyponatremia is divided into cases with dilute urine and concentrated urine.<ref name=CMAJ2014/> Cases in which the urine is dilute include adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and polydipsia or potomania.<ref name=CMAJ2014/> Cases in which the urine is concentrated include syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).<ref name=CMAJ2014/> High volume hyponatremia can occur from heart failure, liver failure, and kidney failure.<ref name=CMAJ2014/> Conditions that can lead to falsely low sodium measurements include hyperproteinemia such as in multiple myeloma, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia.<ref name=Fil2016/><ref name=Ros2013></ref>
Treatment is based on the underlying cause.<ref name=CMAJ2014/> Correcting hyponatremia too quickly can lead to complications.<ref name=Fil2016/> Rapid partial correction with 3% normal saline is only recommended in those with significant symptoms and occasionally those in whom the condition was of rapid onset.<ref name=CMAJ2014/><ref name=Ros2013/> Low volume hyponatremia is typically treated with intravenous normal saline.<ref name=CMAJ2014/> SIADH is typically treated by correcting the underlying cause and with fluid restriction while high volume hyponatremia is typically treated with both fluid restriction and a diet low in salt.<ref name="babar" /><ref name=CMAJ2014/> Correction should generally be gradual in those in whom the low levels have been present for more than two days.<ref name=CMAJ2014></ref>
 
Hyponatremia is the most common type of electrolyte imbalance.<ref name=Din2017></ref> It occurs in about 20% of those admitted to hospital and 10% of people during or after an endurance sporting event.<ref name=Ann2015/><ref name=Fil2016/> Among those in hospital, hyponatremia is associated with an increased risk of death.<ref name=Fil2016></ref> The economic costs of hyponatremia are estimated at $2.6 billion in the United States.<ref></ref>
