Edgar Cayce ; 18 March 1877&nbsp;â€“ 3 January 1945) was an American clairvoyant who claimed, uniquely, to channel his own higher self.<ref></ref> Cayce's channeling sessions happened in a trance state that he would induce with help from his friend Al Layne or his wife until later in life, when he became accustomed enough to do so on his own. During these sessions, Cayce would answer questions on subjects as varied as healing, reincarnation, dreams, the afterlife, past-life, nutrition, Atlantis and future events. As a devout Christian and Sunday school teacher, his channelling claims were a source of trouble for him because channelling was typically criticized by practitioners of his faith as being demonic. Cayce, in contrast, believed that it was his subconscious exploring the dream realm, where he believed minds were eternity connected. Cayce founded a nonprofit organization, the Association for Research and Enlightenment,<ref name='ARE About/Mission'></ref> to store and facilitate the study of his channelings, as well as run a hospital. A biographer gave him the nickname The Sleeping Prophet.<ref> urltoken 
Some consider him the true founder and a principal source of the most characteristic beliefs of the New Age movement.<ref></ref>
