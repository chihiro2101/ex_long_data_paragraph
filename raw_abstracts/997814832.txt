Fibrinogen (factor I) is a glycoprotein complex, made in the liver,<ref name="pmid23852822" /> that circulates in the blood of all vertebrates.<ref></ref> During tissue and vascular injury, it is converted Enzyme by thrombin to fibrin and then to a fibrin-based blood clot. Fibrin clots function primarily to occlude blood vessels to stop bleeding. Fibrin also binds and reduces the activity of thrombin. This activity, sometimes referred to as antithrombin I, limits clotting.<ref name="pmid23852822"></ref> Fibrin also mediates blood platelet and endothelial cell spreading, tissue fibroblast proliferation, Capillary action, and angiogenesis and thereby promotes revascularization and wound healing.<ref name="pmid16102057"></ref>
Reduced and/or dysfunctional fibrinogens occur in various congenital and acquired human List of fibrinogen disorders. These disorders represent a group of rare conditions in which individuals may present with severe episodes of pathological bleeding and thrombosis; these conditions are treated by supplementing blood fibrinogen levels and inhibiting blood clotting, respectively.<ref name="pmid27019462"></ref><ref name="pmid21952526"></ref> These disorders may also be the cause of certain liver and kidney diseases.<ref name="pmid23852822"/>
Fibrinogen is a "positive" acute-phase protein, i.e. its blood levels rise in response to systemic inflammation, tissue injury, and certain other events. It is also elevated in various cancers. Elevated levels of fibrinogen in inflammation as well as cancer and other conditions have been suggested to be the cause of thrombosis and vascular injury that accompanies these conditions.<ref name="pmid22037947"></ref><ref name="pmid28833193"></ref>
