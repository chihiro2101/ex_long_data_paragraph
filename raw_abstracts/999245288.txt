The enteric nervous system (ENS) or intrinsic nervous system is one of the main divisions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and consists of a mesh-like system of neurons that governs the function of the gastrointestinal tract.<ref name="Furness2008"/> It is capable of acting independently of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, although it may be influenced by them. The ENS is also called the second brain.<ref></ref><ref></ref> It is derived from neural crest cells.<ref name="pmid18385256"></ref><ref name="pmid16961690"></ref>
The enteric nervous system is capable of operating independently of the brain and spinal cord,<ref name="Gershon"/> but does rely on innervation from the autonomic nervous system via the vagus nerve and prevertebral ganglia in healthy subjects. However, studies have shown that the system is operable with a severed vagus nerve.<ref name="amjphysgastro"></ref> The neurons of the enteric nervous system control the motor functions of the system, in addition to the secretion of gastrointestinal enzymes. These neurons communicate through many neurotransmitters similar to the CNS, including acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin. The large presence of serotonin and dopamine in the gut are key areas of research for neurogastroenterologists.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
