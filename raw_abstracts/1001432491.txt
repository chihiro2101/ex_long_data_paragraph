A micrometeoroid is a tiny meteoroid: a small particle of rock in space, usually weighing less than a gram. A micrometeorite is such a particle that survives passage through the Earth's atmosphere and reaches the Earth's surface.
The term "micrometeoroid" was officially deprecated by the IAU in 2017, as redundant to meteoroid.<ref></ref>
