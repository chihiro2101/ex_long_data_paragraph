The swim bladder, gas bladder, fish maw, or air bladder is an internal gas-filled organ that contributes to the ability of many bony fish (but not cartilaginous fish<ref></ref>) to control their buoyancy, and thus to stay at their current water depth without having to waste energy in swimming.<ref name="Orr"></ref> Also, the dorsal position of the swim bladder means the center of mass is below the centroid, allowing it to act as a stabilizing agent. Additionally, the swim bladder functions as a resonator, to produce or receive sound.
The swim bladder is evolutionarily homologous to the lungs. Charles Darwin remarked upon this in On the Origin of Species.<ref name=origin>Darwin, Charles (1859) urltoken Origin of Species Page 190, reprinted 1872 by D. Appleton.</ref> Darwin reasoned that the lung in air-breathing vertebrates had derived from a more primitive swim bladder.
In the embryonic stages, some species, such as redlip blenny,<ref></ref> have lost the swim bladder again, mostly bottom dwellers like the weather fish. Other fish—like the opah and the pomfret—use their pectoral fins to swim and balance the weight of the head to keep a horizontal position. The normally bottom dwelling sea robin can use their pectoral fins to produce lift while swimming.
The gas/tissue interface at the swim bladder produces a strong reflection of sound, which is used in sonar equipment to find fish.
Chondrichthyes, such as sharks and rays, do not have swim bladders. Some of them can control their depth only by swimming (using dynamic lift); others store fats or oils with density less than that of seawater to produce a neutral or near neutral buoyancy, which does not change with depth.
