Magnesium oxide (MgO), or magnesia, is a white hygroscopy solid mineral that occurs naturally as periclase and is a source of magnesium (see also oxide). It has an empirical formula of and consists of a lattice of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions and O<sup>2−</sup> ions held together by ionic bonding. Magnesium hydroxide forms in the presence of water (MgO + H<sub>2</sub>O → Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>), but it can be reversed by heating it to remove moisture.
Magnesium oxide was historically known as magnesia alba (literally, the white mineral from Magnesia – other sources give magnesia alba as MgCO<sub>3</sub>), to differentiate it from magnesia negra, a black mineral containing what is now known as manganese.
While "magnesium oxide" normally refers to MgO, magnesium peroxide MgO<sub>2</sub> is also known as a compound. According to evolutionary crystal structure prediction,<ref></ref> MgO<sub>2</sub> is thermodynamically stable at pressures above 116 GPa (gigapascals), and a semiconducting suboxide Mg<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is thermodynamically stable above 500 GPa. Because of its stability, MgO is used as a model system for investigating vibrational properties of crystals.<ref></ref>
