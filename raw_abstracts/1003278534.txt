Newhaven is a channel ferry port in East Sussex in England, with regular passenger services to Dieppe.
 
It lies at the mouth of the River Ouse, which has historically migrated westward from Seaford, one of the Cinque Ports. A breakwater was built at the village of Meeching and a new outlet cut through the valley; the railway reached the port in 1847, enabling a train-ferry which brought great activity. The area then became known as the 'new haven', officially recognised as 'The Port of Newhaven' in 1882.
