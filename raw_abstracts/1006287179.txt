The Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) is the facility for object-oriented programming which is part of ANSI Common Lisp. CLOS is a powerful dynamic object system which differs radically from the OOP facilities found in more static languages such as C++ or Java. CLOS was inspired by earlier Lisp object systems such as MIT Flavors and CommonLoops, although it is more general than either. Originally proposed as an add-on, CLOS was adopted as part of the ANSI standard for Common Lisp and has been adapted into other Lisp dialects such as EuLisp or Emacs Lisp.<ref>"CLOS is a standard. Multiple vendors supply CLOS. CLOS (or parts of it) is being used to add object-orientation to other Lisp dialects such as EuLisp or Emacs Lisp." p. 110 of Veitch 1998</ref>
