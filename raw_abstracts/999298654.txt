Pantyhose, called sheer tights, or sheers in the United Kingdom and a few other countries, are close-fitting legwear covering the wearer's body from the waist to the toes. Mostly considered to be a garment for women and girls, pantyhose first appeared on store shelves in 1959 (Allen Gant's product, 'Panti-Legs')<ref></ref> as a convenient alternative to stockings and/or panties (which, in turn, replaced girdles).
Like stockings or knee highs, pantyhose are usually made of nylon, or of other fibers blended with nylon. Pantyhose are designed to:
* Be attractive in appearance,
* Hide physical features such as blemishes, bruises, scars, hair, spider veins, or varicose veins,
* Reduce Panty line,<ref name="Glen Raven 1">Glen Raven, Inc.: Turnpage advertisement "How do gals get this sleek bell bottom look without the bumps of garters and panties? - They don't wear any. They wear Glen Raven Panti-Legs in Cantrece.", USA, 1966</ref> and
* Ease chafing between feet and footwear, or between thighs.
Besides being worn as fashion, in Western society pantyhose are sometimes worn by women as part of formal dress. Also, the dress code of some companies and schools may require pantyhose or fashion tights to be worn when skirts or shorts are worn as part of a uniform.
