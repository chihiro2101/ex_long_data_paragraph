Physiognomy (from the Greek φύσις physis meaning "nature" and gnomon meaning "judge" or "interpreter") is the practice of assessing a person's character or personality from their outer appearance—especially the face. The term can also refer to the general appearance of a person, object, or terrain without reference to its implied characteristics—as in the physiognomy of an individual plant (see plant life-form) or of a plant community (see vegetation).
Credence of such study has varied. The practice was well accepted by the Greek philosophys, but fell into disrepute in the Middle Ages when practised by vagabonds and Charlatan. It was then revived and popularised by Johann Kaspar Lavater before falling from favour again in the late 19th century.<ref name="newscientist2"> urltoken How your looks betray your personality – New Scientist (Magazine issue 2695) – 11 February 2009: Roger Highfield, Richard Wiseman, and Rob Jenkins</ref> Physiognomy as understood in the past meets the contemporary definition of a pseudoscience.<ref name=porter></ref> Popular in the 19th century, it has been used as a basis for scientific racism.<ref>American Anthropological Association.

Physiognomy is also sometimes referred to as anthroposcopy, though the expression was more common in the 19th century when the word originated.<ref></ref>
