The Amiiformes order of fish has only one extant species, the bowfin (Amia calva). These Amiiformes are found in the freshwater systems throughout North America and parts of southern Canada. They live in freshwater streams, rivers, and swamps. These bowfin fish are not on the endangered list. They have the ability to go to the surface to breathe if the water level is too low. The extinct species of the Amiiformes can be found fossilized in Asia and Europe, but the bowfin is the last living species in the order. 
Characteristics of Amiiformes are a cylindrical body with a long dorsal fin, single gular plate, urltoken heterocercal caudal fin, 10 to 13 flattened urltoken branchiostegal rays, maxilla included in gape, and prominent ocellus near upper base of caudal fin.
