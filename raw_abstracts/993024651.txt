Thomas Walsingham (died c. 1422) was an England chronicler, and is the source of much of the knowledge of the reigns of Richard II, Henry IV and Henry V, and the careers of John Wycliff and Wat Tyler.
Walsingham was a Benedictine monk who spent most of his life at St. Albans Abbey, where he was superintendent of the copying room (scriptorium). His works include Chronicon Angliæ, controversially attacking John of Gaunt, and Ypodigma Neustriæ (Chronicle of Normandy), justifying Henry V's invasion, and dedicated to him in 1419.
He is no relation to Sir Francis Walsingham, spymaster to Queen Elizabeth I.
