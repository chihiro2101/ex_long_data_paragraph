A bug-out bag or BOB<ref name=South1990p221></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> is a portable kit that normally contains the items one would require to survive for 72 hours<ref></ref> when evacuating from a disaster, although some kits are designed to last longer periods. Other names for such a bag are a 72-hour kit,<ref></ref> battle box, grab bag, go bag, GOOD bag (get out of Dodge),<ref></ref><ref></ref> personal emergency relocation kit (PERK), or quick run bag (QRB).<ref></ref><ref></ref>
The focus is on evacuation, rather than long-term survival, distinguishing the bug-out bag from a survival kit, an aviation or a boating emergency kit, or a fixed-site disaster supplies kit. The kits are also popular in the survivalism subculture.
