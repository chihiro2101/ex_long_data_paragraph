Territorial authorities are the second tier of local government in New Zealand, below regional councils. There are 67 territorial authorities: 13 city councils, 53 district councils and the Chatham Islands Council.<ref></ref> District councils serve a combination of rural and urban communities, while city councils administer the larger urban areas.<ref group="note">City councils serve a population of more than 50,000 in a predominantly urban area.</ref> Five territorial authorities (Auckland, Nelson, Gisborne, Tasman and Marlborough) also perform the functions of a regional council and thus are unitary authorities. The Chatham Islands Council is a sui generis territorial authority that is similar to a unitary authority.
Territorial authority districts are not subdivisions of regions, and some of them fall within more than one region. Regional council areas are based on water catchment areas, whereas territorial authorities are based on community of interest and road access. Regional councils are responsible for the administration of many environmental and public transport matters, while the territorial authorities administer local roading and reserves, water supply and sanitation, building consents, the land use and subdivision aspects of resource management, and other local matters.<ref></ref> Some activities are delegated to council-controlled organisations. The scope of powers is specified by the Local Government Act 2002.<ref name="LGA_2002"></ref>
