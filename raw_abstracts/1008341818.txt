Chitons are marine molluscs of varying size in the class Polyplacophora ,<ref name=EB1911></ref> formerly known as Amphineura.<ref></ref> About 940<ref></ref><ref></ref> extant and 430<ref></ref> fossil species are recognized.
They are also sometimes known as sea cradles or "coat-of-mail shells", or more formally as loricates, polyplacophorans, and occasionally as polyplacophores.
Chitons have a shell composed of eight separate shell plates or valves.<ref name=EB1911/> These plates overlap slightly at the front and back edges, and yet articulate well with one another. Because of this, the shell provides protection at the same time as permitting the chiton to flex upward when needed for locomotion over uneven surfaces, and even allows the animal to curl up into a ball when dislodged from rocks.<ref></ref> The shell plates are encircled by a skirt known as a girdle.
