Nicholas William Leeson<ref name="bio_p2"/> (born 25 February 1967) is an English former derivatives trader notorious for bankrupting Barings Bank, the United Kingdom's oldest merchant bank. He was a rogue trader who made fraudulent, unauthorized and speculation trades, and his actions led directly to the 1995 collapse of the bank, for which he was sentenced to prison.
Between 2005 and 2011, Leeson had management roles at League of Ireland club Galway United. After suffering financial difficulties and going into bankruptcy, the club dropped out of the League of Ireland after the 2011 season. He is also active on the keynote and after-dinner speaking circuit, where he advises companies about risk and corporate responsibility. Leeson competed in the UK Celebrity Big Brother 2018, where he finished in fourth place.
