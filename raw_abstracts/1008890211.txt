Bon, also spelled Bön is considered to be the autochthonous religious tradition of Tibet. A distinction is sometimes made between:
# the Old Bon or Bön nying , dating back to the pre-dynastic era;
# the Eternal Bon or Yungdrung Bön , the classical Bon tradition (which emerged in the tenth to the eleventh century); and
# the New Bon or Bonsar , a late syncretic movement dating back to the fourteenth century and active in eastern Tibet. <ref name=Achard2015> </ref> <ref></ref> 
Its relationship to Tibetan Buddhism has been a subject of debate. Followers of Bon, known as Bonpos (Wylie: bon po), believe that the religion originated in a land called Tazig (Wylie: stag gzig), identified by scholars variously as Persia, Central Asia, or the area around Mount Kailash in the west of the Tibetan Plateau.<ref>Karmay, Samten G., "Extract from 'A General Introduction to the History and Doctrines of Bon'", in Alex McKay, ed. History of Tibet, Volume 1 (New York: Routledge, 2003), 496-9.</ref> Bonpos identify Shenrab Miwo (Wylie: gshen rab mi bo) as Bon's founder, although there are no available sources to establish this figure's historicity.<ref>Karmay, 499.</ref> From Tazig, Bon was brought first to Zhang Zhung, a kingdom to the west of the Tibetan Plateau, and then to Tibet.<ref>Namdak, Lopon Tenzin, Heart Drops of Dharmakaya (Ithaca: Snow Lion Publications, 2002).</ref> Western scholars have posited several origins for Bon, and have used the term Bon in many ways. Tibetan Buddhist scholarship tends to cast Bon in a negative, adversarial light, with derogatory stories about Bon appearing in a number of Buddhist histories.<ref>Samuel, Geoffrey, "Shamanism, Bon, and Tibetan Religion," in Alex McKay, ed. History of Tibet, Volume 1 (New York: Routledge, 2003), 462-3.</ref> The Rimé movement within Tibetan religion encouraged more ecumenical attitudes between Bonpos and Buddhists. Western scholars began to take Bon seriously as a religious tradition worthy of study in the 1960s, in large part inspired by English scholar David Snellgrove's work.<ref>Samuel, 465-7.</ref> Following the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1959, Bonpo scholars began to arrive in Europe and North America, encouraging interest in Bon in the West.<ref>Samuel, 465.</ref> Today, Bon is practiced by Tibetans both in Tibet and in the Tibetan diaspora, and there are Bonpo centers in cities around the world.
