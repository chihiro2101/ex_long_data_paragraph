Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a species of yeast (single-celled fungus microorganisms). The species has been instrumental in winemaking, baking, and brewing since ancient times. It is believed to have been originally isolated from the skin of grapes (one can see the yeast as a component of the thin white film on the skins of some dark-colored fruits such as plums; it exists among the waxes of the cuticle). It is one of the most intensively studied Eukaryote model organisms in molecular and cell biology, much like Escherichia coli as the model bacteria. It is the microorganism behind the most common type of fermentation. S.&nbsp;cerevisiae cells are round to ovoid, 5–10&nbsp;μm in diameter. It reproduces by budding.<ref></ref>
Many proteins important in human biology were first discovered by studying their homologs in yeast; these proteins include cell cycle proteins, signaling proteins, and protein-processing enzymes. S. cerevisiae is currently the only yeast cell known to have Berkeley body present, which are involved in particular secretory pathways. Antibodies against S.&nbsp;cerevisiae are found in 60–70% of patients with Crohn's disease and 10–15% of patients with ulcerative colitis (and 8% of healthy controls).<ref></ref> S. cerevisiae has been found to contribute to the smell of bread; the proline and ornithine present in yeast are precursors of the 2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline, a roast‐smelling odorant, in the bread crust.<ref></ref>
