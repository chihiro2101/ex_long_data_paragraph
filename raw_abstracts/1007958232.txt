The Hail Mary (Latin: Ave Maria) is a traditional Scripture-based Christian prayer of praise for and petition to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Since the sixteenth century, the Roman Catholic version of the prayer closes with an appeal for her intercession. Largely based on two phrases in the Gospel of Luke, the prayer takes different forms in various traditions. It has often been set to music.
In the Latin Church, the prayer forms the basis of the Rosary and the Angelus prayers. The liturgies of the Oriental Orthodox Churches use many prayers addressed to Mary, but only vaguely similar to the Hail Mary.<ref> urltoken Claremont Coptic Encyclopedia: Hail Mary</ref> On the other hand, the Eastern Orthodox Church has a quite similar prayer (without explicit request for her intercession), both in Greek and in translations, that it frequently uses outside of the formal liturgy, like the Jesus Prayer. The Eastern Catholic Churches follow their respective traditions or adopt the Latin-Church prayer, which is also used by many other Western groups historically associated with the Catholic Church such as Anglicans, Independent Catholics, and Old Catholics.
