Syntactic ambiguity, also called structural ambiguity,<ref name="Dallin"/> amphiboly or amphibology, is a situation where a sentence may be interpreted in more than one way due to ambiguous syntax.
Syntactic ambiguity arises not from the range of polysemy, but from the relationship between the words and clauses of a sentence, and the sentence structure underlying the word order therein. In other words, a sentence is syntactically ambiguous when a reader or listener can reasonably interpret one sentence as having more than one possible structure.
In legal disputes, courts may be asked to interpret the meaning of syntactic ambiguities in statutes or contracts. In some instances, arguments asserting highly unlikely interpretations have been deemed frivolous. A set of possible parse trees for an ambiguous sentence is called a parse forest.<ref>Billot, Sylvie, and Bernard Lang. " urltoken The structure of shared forests in ambiguous parsing."
