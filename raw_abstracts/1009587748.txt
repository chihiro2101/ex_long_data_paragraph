The New Romantic movement was a pop culture movement that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The movement emerged from the nightclub scene in London and Birmingham at venues such as Billy's and The Blitz.<ref name=Johnson2009></ref> The New Romantic movement was characterised by flamboyant, eccentric fashion inspired by fashion boutiques such as Kahn and Bell in Birmingham and PX in London.<ref name=BorrelliPersson2015></ref> Early adherents of the movement were often referred to by the press by such names as Blitz Kids, New Dandy and Romantic Rebels.<ref></ref><ref name=Cateforis2011pp47-8></ref>
Influenced by David Bowie, Marc Bolan and Roxy Music, the New Romantics developed fashions inspired by the glam rock era coupled with the early Romanticism of the late 18th and early 19th century (from which the movement took its name). The term "New Romantic" is known to have been coined by musician, producer, manager and innovator Richard James Burgess.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> In response to a question about being credited with coining the term New Romantic in an interview with The Electricity Club, Burgess said: "Initially I was using three terms - Futurist, Electronic Dance Music (the Landscape singles have EDM printed on them) and New Romantic."<ref></ref> In an interview with NZ Musician, Burgess was asked how he came to be credited with originating the term New Romantic, and replied: "I always had a kind of marketing sensibility and I felt that it was important for a movement to have a name. If you look at the first single off the Tearooms album – "European Man" – it has the catalogue number EDM1 on the label, and the back cover of the single says 'Electronic Dance Music… EDM; computer programmed to perfection for your listening pleasure…' That was many years before the term EDM began being commonly used. The name futurist was floating around as well but never really stuck. 'New Romantic' didn't really fit Landscape very well but it did fit the Blitz scene and Spandau Ballet, although most of the groups tried to distance themselves from it."<ref></ref><ref></ref>
Though it was a fashion movement, several British music acts in the late 1970s and early 1980s adopted the style and became known to epitomise it within the press, including Steve Strange of Visage, Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, A Flock of Seagulls, Classix Nouveaux and Boy George (of Culture Club). Ultravox were also often identified as New Romantics by the press, although they did not exhibit the same visual styles of the movement, despite their link to the band Visage. Japan and Adam and the Ants were also labelled as New Romantic artists by the press, although both repudiated this and neither had any direct connection to the original scene.<ref name=Cateforis2011pp47-8/> A number of these bands adopted synthesizers and helped to develop synth-pop in the early 1980s, which, combined with the distinctive New Romantic visuals, helped them first to national success in the UK, and then, via MTV, play a major part in the Second British Invasion of the U.S. charts.
By the end of 1981, the original movement had largely dissipated.<ref name=Cateforis2011pp47-8/><ref name="Johnson2009"/> Although some of the artists associated with the scene continued their careers, they had largely abandoned the aesthetics of the movement. There were attempts to revive the movement from the 1990s, including the short-lived Romo scene.
