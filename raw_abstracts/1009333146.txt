Sodium carbonate, , (also known as washing soda, soda ash and soda crystals) is the inorganic compound with the formula Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and its various hydrates. All forms are white, water-soluble salts that yield moderately alkaline solutions in water. Historically it was extracted from the ashes of plants growing in sodium-rich soils. Because the ashes of these sodium-rich plants were noticeably different from ashes of wood (once used to produce potash), sodium carbonate became known as "soda ash."<ref></ref> It is produced in large quantities from sodium chloride and limestone by the Solvay process.
