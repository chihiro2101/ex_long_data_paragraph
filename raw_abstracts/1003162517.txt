An operant conditioning chamber (also known as the Skinner box) is a laboratory equipment used to study animal behavior. The operant conditioning chamber was created by B. F. Skinner while he was a graduate student at Harvard University. It may have been inspired by Jerzy Konorski studies. It is used to study both operant conditioning and classical conditioning.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
Skinner created the operant chamber as a variation of the puzzle box originally created by Edward Thorndike.<ref></ref>
