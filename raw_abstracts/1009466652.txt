Jefferson Starship is an American rock band from San Francisco, California, formed in 1974 by former members of Jefferson Airplane. Between 1974 and 1984, they released eight gold or platinum selling studio albums. The band went through several major changes in personnel and genres through the years while retaining the Jefferson Starship name. The band name was retired in 1985, but it was picked up again in the early 1990s by a revival of the group led by Paul Kantner, which has continued following his death in 2016.
The group was formed by former Jefferson Airplane members Kantner and Grace Slick, and evolved from several solo albums they had recorded. They were joined by David Freiberg, Craig Chaquico and Pete Sears. Former Airplane frontman Marty Balin subsequently joined the group in 1975, and the following year's album Spitfire was a top five hit. Slick and Balin both left the group in 1978, leaving the remaining members to recruit Mickey Thomas as their replacement. Slick rejoined the group in 1981, which continued with minor chart success. Kanter quit in 1984 and took legal action towards using the name; the remaining members became Starship. Kantner reformed the group as Jefferson Starship: The Next Generation in the early 1990s, which toured regularly throughout that decade and into the 21st century. Following his death, the group continued with new members; Chaquico threatened legal action before reaching a settlement.
