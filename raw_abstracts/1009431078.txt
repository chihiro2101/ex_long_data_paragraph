Humphry Repton (21 April 1752 â€“ 24 March 1818) was the last great English landscape designer of the eighteenth century, often regarded as the successor to Capability Brown; he also sowed the seeds of the more intricate and eclectic styles of the 19th century. His first name is often incorrectly rendered "Humphrey".
In 2018, the bicentenary of Repton's death, several groups held events throughout the United Kingdom to celebrate his work.<ref></ref>
