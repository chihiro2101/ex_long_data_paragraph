The gens Rabiria was a minor plebs family at Ancient Rome. Although of senatorial rank, few members of this gens appear in history, and the only one known to have held any of the higher offices of the Roman state was Gaius Rabirius Postumus, who was praetor circa 48 or 47 BC.<ref>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol.
