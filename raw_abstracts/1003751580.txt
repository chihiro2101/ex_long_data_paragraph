Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (until 2014 known as Lactobacillus bulgaricus) is one of over 200 published species in the Lactobacillus genome complex (LGC)<ref></ref> and is the main bacterium used for the production of yogurt. It also plays a crucial role in the ripening of some cheeses,<ref name=":2"></ref> as well as in other processes involving naturally fermented products. It is defined as homofermentive lactic acid bacteria due to lactic acid being the single end product of its carbohydrate digestion. It is also considered a probiotic.<ref name=":1"></ref>
It is a gram-positive rod that may appear long and filamentous. It is Motility and does not form spores. It is also non-pathogenic. It is regarded as aciduric or acidophilic, since it requires a low pH (around 5.4–4.6) to grow effectively. In addition, it is anaerobic.<ref></ref> As it grows on raw dairy products, it creates and maintains the acidic environment that it needs to thrive via its production of lactic acid. In addition, it grows optimally at temperatures of 40–44&nbsp;°C under anaerobic conditions. It has complex nutritional requirements which vary according to the environment. These include carbohydrates, unsaturated fatty acids, amino acids, and vitamins.
First identified in 1905 by the Bulgarian doctor Stamen Grigorov by isolating it from a yogurt sample, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus can be found naturally in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals living in Bulgaria. One strain, Lactobacillus bulgaricus GLB44, is extracted from the leaves of the Galanthus nivalis (snowdrop flower) in Bulgaria as well.<ref></ref> The bacterium is also grown artificially in many countries. It is the national microorganism of India.<ref name="courtin" />
