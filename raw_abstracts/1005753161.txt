In 1675, after the Battle of Fehrbellin and the Brandenburg-Prussian advance in Swedish Pomerania during the Scanian War, Frederick William decided to establish a navy.<ref name=Heyden11/> He engaged Dutch merchant and shipowner Benjamin Raule as his advisor, who after a first personal meeting with Frederick William in 1675 settled in Brandenburg in 1676<ref name=Heyden11/> and became the major figure of Brandenburg-Prussia's emerging naval and colonial enterprise. The Brandenburg-Prussian navy was established from ten ships which Frederick William leased from Raule, and achieved first successes in the war against Sweden supporting the siege of Stralsund and Stettin and the invasion of RÃ¼gen.<ref name=Heyden12>van der Heyden (2001), p. 12</ref> In Pillau (now Baltiysk) on the East Prussian coast, Raule established shipyards and enlarged the port facilities.<ref name=Heyden11/>
After the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679), the navy was used to hijack Swedish ships in the Baltic Sea, and in 1680, six Brandenburg-Prussian vessels captured the Spain vessel Carolus Secundus near Oostende to pressure Spain to pay promised subsidies.<ref name=Heyden12/> The Spanish ship was renamed Markgraf von Brandenburg ("Margrave of Brandenburg") and became the flagship of an Atlantic fleet that was ordered to capture Spanish vessels carrying silver; it was not successful in this mission.<ref name=Heyden12/> In the following years, the navy was expanded, and the policy of leasing ships was replaced by the policy of building or purchasing them.<ref name=Heyden17>van der Heyden (2001), p. 17</ref> On 1 October 1684 Frederick William bought all ships that had been leased for 110,000 talers.<ref name=Heyden17/> Also in 1684, the East Frisian port of Emden replaced Pillau as the main Brandenburg-Prussian naval base.<ref name=Heyden35>van der Heyden (2001), p. 35</ref> From Pillau, part of the shipyard, the admiral's house and the wooden church of the employees was transferred to Emden.<ref name=Heyden35/> While Emden was not part of Brandenburg-Prussia, the elector owned a nearby castle, Greetsiel, and negotiated an agreement with the town to maintain a garrison and a port.<ref name=Heyden35/>
