The Lambeth Conference is a decennial assembly of bishops of the Anglican Communion convened by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The first such conference took place at Lambeth in 1867.
As the Anglican Communion is an international association of autonomous national and regional churches and is not a governing body, the Lambeth Conferences serve a collaborative and consultative function, expressing "the mind of the communion" on issues of the day.<ref>The truth shall make you free: the Lambeth Conference 1988: the reports, resolutions & pastoral letters from the bishops (Church House Publishing, 1988), p. 118</ref>
Resolutions which a Lambeth Conference may pass are without legal effect, but they are nonetheless influential. So, although the resolutions of conferences carry no legislative authority, they "do carry great moral and spiritual authority." "Its statements on social issues have influenced church policy in the churches."
These conferences form one of the communion's four "Instruments of Communion".<ref></ref>
