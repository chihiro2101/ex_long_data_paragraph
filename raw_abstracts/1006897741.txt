Giambattista Vico (born Giovan Battista Vico ; ; 23 June 1668 â€“ 23 January 1744) was an Italian political philosopher and rhetorician, historian and jurist of the Age of Enlightenment. He criticized the expansion and development of modern rationalism, was an apologist for Classical Antiquity, finding Cartesian analysis and other types of reductionism impractical to daily life, and was the first expositor of the fundamentals of social science and of semiotics. 
The Latin aphorism Verum esse ipsum factum ("What is true is precisely what is made") coined by Vico is an early instance of constructivist epistemology.<ref>Ernst von Glasersfeld, An Introduction to Radical Constructivism.</ref><ref>Bizzell and Herzberg, The Rhetorical Tradition, p. 800.</ref> He inaugurated the modern field of the philosophy of history, and, although the term philosophy of history is not in his writings, Vico spoke of a "history of philosophy narrated philosophically."<ref>The contemporary interpretation of Vico is by Verene, Donald Philip.

Vico's intellectual Masterpiece is the book Scienza Nuova (1725, New Science), which attempts a systematic organization of the humanities as a single science that recorded and explained the historical cycles by which societies rise and fall.<ref>The Penguin Encyclopedia (2006), David Crystal, ed., p. 1,409.</ref>
