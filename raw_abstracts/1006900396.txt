The Battle of Seneffe took place on 11 August 1674 near Seneffe in present-day Belgium and was one of the most notable engagements of the Franco-Dutch War. It was fought between a French army commanded by the Grand Condé and a combined Dutch, Imperial, and Spain force led by William of Orange. 
One of only three battles in the Spanish Netherlands during the war, Seneffe was the most expensive in terms of casualties, although estimates vary considerably. After successfully repulsing the Allied assault, Condé launched a series of counter-attacks against the advice of his subordinates. 
Defeat ended Allied hopes of invading Northern France, but French losses shocked Louis XIV, who thereafter focused on sieges, the dominant form of warfare in the late 17th century. Of the two other battles fought in this theatre, Cassel was an attempt to relieve Saint-Omer, while Saint-Denis was fought to prevent the fall of Mons.
