A microRNA (abbreviated miRNA) is a small single-stranded non-coding RNA molecule (containing about 22 nucleotides) found in plants, animals and some viruses, that functions in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.<ref name="Metazoan MicroRNAs"></ref> miRNAs function via base-pairing with complementary sequences within mRNA molecules.<ref name="pmid19167326"></ref> As a result, these mRNA molecules are silenced, by one or more of the following processes: (1) Cleavage of the mRNA strand into two pieces, (2) Destabilization of the mRNA through shortening of its poly(A) tail, and (3) Less efficient translation of the mRNA into proteins by ribosomes.<ref name="pmid19167326" /><ref></ref>
miRNAs resemble the small interfering RNA of the RNA interference pathway, except miRNAs derive from regions of RNA transcripts that fold back on themselves to form short hairpins, whereas siRNAs derive from longer regions of double-stranded RNA.<ref name="pmid14744438"></ref> The human genome may encode over 1900 miRNAs,<ref> urltoken Homo sapiens miRNAs in the miRBase at Manchester University</ref> although more recent analysis indicates that the number is closer to 600.<ref name="ReferenceD"></ref>
miRNAs are abundant in many mammalian cell types<ref name="pmid12672692"></ref><ref name="pmid12007417"></ref> and as extracellular circulating miRNAs.<ref name=Kumar></ref> Circulating miRNAs are released into body fluids including blood and cerebrospinal fluid and have the potential to be available as biomarkers in a number of diseases.<ref name=Kumar/><ref name=PN></ref> MiRNAs appear to target about 60% of the genes of humans and other mammals.<ref name="Lewis BP, Burge CB, Bartel DP 2005 15â€“20"></ref><ref name="pmid18955434"></ref> Many miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved, which implies that they have important biological functions.<ref name="ReferenceD"/><ref name="Metazoan MicroRNAs"/> For example, 90 families of miRNAs have been conserved since at least the common ancestor of mammals and fish, and most of these conserved miRNAs have important functions, as shown by studies in which genes for one or more members of a family have been knocked out in mice.<ref name="Metazoan MicroRNAs"/>
