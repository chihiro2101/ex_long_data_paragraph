Yerba mate or yerba-maté<ref><br /><br /><br /><br /></ref> (Ilex paraguariensis), from Spanish ; , or ; , , is a plant species of the holly genus Ilex native to South America.<ref></ref> It was named by the French botanist Augustin Saint-Hilaire.<ref></ref>
The indigenous Guaraní and some Tupí communities (whose territory covered present-day Paraguay, the Misiones province of Argentina, southern Brazil and Uruguay) first cultivated and used yerba mate prior to European colonization of the Americas. The leaves of the plant are steeped in hot water to make a beverage known as mate. When served cold, it is called tereré in the Guarani language. Both the plant and the beverage contain caffeine.
Mate is traditionally consumed in central and southern regions of South America, primarily in Paraguay, as well as in Argentina, Uruguay, southern and central-western Brazil, the Gran Chaco of Bolivia, and southern Chile.<ref></ref> It has also become popular in the Druze community in the Levant, especially in Syria and Lebanon, where it is imported from Argentina, thanks to 19th-century Syrian Argentines.<ref></ref> Yerba mate can now be found worldwide in various energy drinks as well as being sold as a bottled or canned iced tea.
