Maedhros is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, first introduced as a major character in The Silmarillion and later mentioned in Unfinished Tales and The Children of Húrin. In the books, Maedhros was the first son of Fëanor, the creator of the Silmarils that were essential to the plot and the history of Middle-earth. Following his father in swearing to reclaim the Silmarils from anyone who took and kept them, he led his people the Noldor in their war against Morgoth in Middle-earth, and brought eventual ruin upon himself and his brothers. Maedhros has been the subject of artwork by artists such as Jenny Dolfen and Alan Lee.
