Wilhelm Iwan Friederich August Freiherr<ref></ref> von Gloeden (September 16, 1856 â€“ February 16, 1931) was a German photographer who worked mainly in Italy. He is mostly known for his pastoral nude (art) of Sicilian boys, which usually featured props such as wreaths or amphoras, suggesting a setting in the Greece or Italy of antiquity. From a modern standpoint, his work is commendable due to his controlled use of lighting as well as the often elegant poses of his models. His innovations include the use of photographic filters and special body makeup (a mixture of milk, olive oil, and glycerin) to concealer.
