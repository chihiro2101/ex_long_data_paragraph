Takeoff is the phase of flight in which an aerospace vehicle leaves the ground and becomes airborne.
For aircraft that take off horizontally, this usually involves starting with a transition from moving along the ground on a runway. For balloons, helicopters and some specialized fixed-wing aircraft (VTOL aircraft such as the Harrier), no runway is needed.
