A knuckleball or knuckler is a baseball pitch thrown to minimize the spin of the ball in flight, causing an erratic, unpredictable motion. The air flow over a seam of the ball causes the ball to transition from laminar to turbulent flow. This transition adds a deflecting force to the baseball, making it difficult for batters to hit, but also difficult for pitchers to control and catchers to catch; umpires are challenged as well, as the ball's irregular motion through the air makes it harder to call balls and strikes.<ref name=hoffman>Hoffman, Benjamin. urltoken "Not So Easy on the Eyes" New York Times (June 23, 2012)</ref> A pitcher who throws knuckleballs is known as a knuckleballer.
