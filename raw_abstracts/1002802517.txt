Badlands are a type of dry terrain where softer sedimentary rocks and clay-rich soils have been extensively eroded by wind and water.<ref name="Chambers">"Badlands" in Chambers's Encyclop√¶dia. London: George Newnes, 1961, Vol. 2, p. 47.</ref> They are characterized by steep slopes, minimal vegetation, lack of a substantial regolith, and high drainage density.<ref name="A.D. Abrahams, Editors 2009">A.J. Parsons and A.D. Abrahams, Editors (2009) Geomorphology of Desert Environments (2nd ed.) Springer Science & Business Media </ref> Canyons, ravines, gully, buttes, mesas, hoodoos and other such geologic forms are common in badlands. They are often difficult to navigate by foot. Badlands often have a spectacular color display that alternates from dark black/blue coal stria to bright clays to red scoria.
