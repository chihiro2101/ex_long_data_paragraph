Joseph Haydn wrote sixty-eight string quartets. (The number was previously thought to be eighty-three, but this includes some arrangements and spurious works.) They are catalogued by Anthony van Hoboken's catalogue of his works, and also by their publication order in the First Haydn Edition (FHE), but are most often simply referred to by their opus numbers.
