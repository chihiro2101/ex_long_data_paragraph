The Caroline Islands (or the Carolines) are a widely scattered archipelago of tiny islands in the western Pacific Ocean, to the north of New Guinea. Politically, they are divided between the Federated States of Micronesia in the eastern part of the group, and Palau at the extreme western end. Historically, this area was also called Nuevas Filipinas or New Philippines,<ref name="Rosser1870"></ref> because they were part of the Spanish East Indies and were governed from Manila in the Philippines.
The Carolines are scattered across a distance of approximately 3540 kilometers (2200 miles), from the westernmost island, Tobi (island), to the easternmost island, Kosrae.<ref name="spanCarolines"></ref>
