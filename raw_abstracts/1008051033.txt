Brie ; is a soft cow's-milk cheese named after Brie, the France region from which it originated (roughly corresponding to the modern d√©partement of Seine-et-Marne). It is pale in color with a slight grayish tinge under a rind of white mould. The rind is typically eaten, with its flavor depending largely upon the ingredients used and its manufacturing environment. It is similar to Camembert, which is native to a different region of France.
