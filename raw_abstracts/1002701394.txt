The Algeciras Conference of 1906 took place in Algeciras, Spain, and lasted from 16 January to 7 April. The purpose of the conference was to find a solution to the First Moroccan Crisis of 1905 between France and Germany, which arose as Germany responded to France's effort to establish a protectorate over the independent state of Morocco.<ref name="history"></ref> Germany was not trying to stop French expansion. Its goal was to enhance its own international prestige, and it failed badly.
