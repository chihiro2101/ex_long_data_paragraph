John Singleton Copley (1738<ref>Allan Cunningham gives the date of his birth as July 3, 1737 (The Lives of the Most Eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, 1830â€“33, V, 162), but the published Boston Records have no entry confirming this date. Copley himself wrote on September 12, 1766, to Peter Pelham, his step-brother, that he had had "resolution enough to live a bachelor to the age of twenty-eight" ("Letters and Papers of John Singleton Copley and Henry Pelham", p. 48, Mass. Hist. Soc. Colls., vol. LXXI (1914)). His daughter, Elizabeth Clarke Greene (in a letter quoted by William Dunlap, A History of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of Design in the United States, vol. I, p. 119. Ed. F. W. Bayley and C. E. Goodspeed, 1918) spoke of her father as "born in 1738." Worthington C. Ford, editor of the Copley-Pelham correspondence, and Frank W. Bayley, a biographer, accept the evidence as indicating that the artist "was born in 1738, and not in 1737 as usually stated" ("Copley-Pelham Letters," p. 48). James Thomas Flexner, John Singleton Copley (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1948), p. 4, gives the "probable" birthdate as July 3, 1738.</ref> &ndash; September 9, 1815) was an Anglo-American painter, active in both colonial America and England. He was probably born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Richard and Mary Singleton Copley, both Anglo-Irish. After becoming well-established as a portrait painter of the wealthy in colonial New England,<ref></ref><ref></ref> he moved to London in 1774, never returning to America. In London, he met considerable success as a portraitist for the next two decades, and also painted a number of large history paintings, which were innovative in their readiness to depict modern subjects and modern dress. His later years were less successful, and he died heavily in debt.
