The Anno Dracula series by Kim Newman—named after Anno Dracula (1992), the series' first novel—is a work of fantasy depicting an alternate history in which the heroes of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula fail to stop Count Dracula's conquest of Great Britain, resulting in a world where vampires are common and increasingly dominant in society. While Dracula is a central figure in the events of the series, he is a minor character in the books themselves, and usually appears in only a few climactic pages of each book. While many of the characters from Newman's Diogenes Club stories appear in the Anno Dracula novels, they are not the same versions as appear in those stories, nor is the Diogenes Club itself exactly the same.
The series is known for its carefully researched historical settings and the author's use as supporting characters of both historical people and fictional characters of the appropriate period. The metafictional style was inspired by the Wold Newton family of Philip José Farmer, and Neil Gaiman helped develop the series (and was originally going to be its co-author).<ref></ref> Gaiman has also credited the series as being one of the main influences on his short story "A Study in Emerald".<ref>Introduction to Fragile Things</ref>
Entries in the series have won the Dracula Society's Children of the Night Award, the Lord Ruthven Award and the International Horror Guild Award, and have been short-listed for the Bram Stoker Award and the Sidewise Award for Alternate History.
The series currently consists of five novels and a number of short stories and novellas. The author is currently contracted for a sixth book.
