Community-supported agriculture (CSA model) or cropsharing is a system that connects the producer and consumers within the food system more closely by allowing the consumer to subscribe to the harvest of a certain farm or group of farms. It is an alternative socioeconomic model of agriculture and food distribution that allows the producer and consumer to share the risks of farming.<ref name="Galt 341â€“365"></ref> The model is a subcategory of civic agriculture that has an overarching goal of strengthening a sense of community through local markets.<ref></ref>
In return for subscribing to a harvest, subscribers receive either a weekly or bi-weekly box of produce or other farm goods. This includes in-season fruits and vegetables and can expand to dried goods, eggs, milk, meat, etc. Typically, farmers try to cultivate a relationship with subscribers by sending weekly letters of what is happening on the farm, inviting them for harvest, or holding an open-farm event. Some CSAs provide for contributions of labor in lieu of a portion of subscription costs.<ref name="usda"></ref>
The term CSA is mostly used in the United States and Canada, but a variety of similar production and economic sub-systems are in use worldwide.
