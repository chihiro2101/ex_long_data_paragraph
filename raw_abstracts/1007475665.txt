A governess is a woman employed to teach and train children in a private household. In contrast to a nanny (formerly called a nurse), she concentrates on teaching children, rather than caring for their physical needs. Her charges are of school age rather than babies.<ref> urltoken A Governess's Duties, Outback House (Australian Broadcasting Corporation).</ref>
The position of governess used to be common in well-off European families before the First World War, especially in the countryside where no suitable school existed nearby. Parents' preference to educate their children at home—rather than send them away to boarding school for months at a time—varied across time and countries. Governesses were usually in charge of girls and younger boys. When a boy was old enough, he left his governess for a tutor or a school.
Governesses are rarer now, except within great house or royal families such as the House of Saud<ref></ref> and in remote regions such as outback Australia.<ref>Harris, Julia: urltoken A career as a Governess?

The reasons for this include personal security, the benefits of a tailored education, and the flexibility to travel or live in multiple locations.<ref> urltoken Return of the governess as parents look to give children exam advantage, The Telegraph, Telegraph.co.uk, 15 March 2009.</ref>
