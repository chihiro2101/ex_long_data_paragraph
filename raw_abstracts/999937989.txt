A Reagan Democrat is a traditionally Democratic voter in the United States, referring initially to white working class Rust Belt and California residents, and later solely to white working-class Rust Belt, who left their party to support Republican presidents Ronald Reagan during either or both of the 1980 and 1984 presidential elections, George H. W. Bush during the 1988 presidential election, and George W. Bush during either or both of the 2000 and 2004 elections.
The term still carries relevance, since part of this group also defected to Donald Trump, in the 2016 presidential election, who won every swing state in the rust belt and became the first Republican candidate to win Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin since 1988. All of these states voted for Reagan in 1980 and 1984, but voted for Democratic president Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
