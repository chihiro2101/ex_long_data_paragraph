Clonaid is a Canadian-based human cloning organization, registered as a company in the Bahamas. Founded in 1997, it has philosophical ties with the UFO religion RaÃ«lism,<ref name=MH20181230 /> which sees cloning as the first step in achieving immortality. On December 27, 2002, Clonaid's chief executive, Brigitte Boisselier, claimed that a baby clone, named Eve, was born. Media coverage of the claim sparked serious criticism and ethical debate that lasted more than a year. Florida attorney Bernard Siegel tried to appoint a special guardian for Eve and threatened to sue Clonaid, because he was afraid that the child might be treated like a lab rat.<ref name="Clone Newcomer Bends U.N.'s Ear"> urltoken Clone Newcomer Bends U.N.'s Ear, Wired News.
