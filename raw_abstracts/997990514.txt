It is often convenient to edit Wikipedia articles using a full-fledged text editor, instead of the standard text area of a web browser. Text editors provide facilities that are very useful for writing and editing articles (especially long articles), such as spell checker, search and replace, macros, syntax highlighting, and alphabetic sorting. They also provide a quick and easy way of saving a local backup copy of an article, possibly for future offline editing. wikEd for Wikipedia (Preferences > Gadgets > Editing) supports some of these features, and some browsers support spell-checking. In any case, you can select Wikipedia VisualEditor for a visual editing, wikipedia:VisualEditor.
This page contains pointers for adapting several external and in-browser text editors to editing Wikipedia articles.
