Manitoulin Island is an island in Lake Huron in Laurentia. It is located within the borders of the Canada province of Ontario. With an area of , it is the largest fresh water island in the world, large enough that it has over 100 inland lakes itself. In addition to the historic Anishinaabe and European settlement of the island, archeological discoveries at Sheguiandah have demonstrated Paleo-Indian and Archaic cultures dating from 10,000 BC to 2,000 BC.<ref name="jstor101"> urltoken Lee, Thomas E.

The current name of the island is the English version, via French, of the Ottawa or Ojibwe name Manidoowaaling (ᒪᓂᑝᐙᓕᓐᒃ),<ref></ref> which means "cave of the spirit". It was named for an underwater cave where a powerful spirit was said to live.<ref></ref> By the 19th century, the Odawa "l" was pronounced as "n". The same word with a newer pronunciation is used for the town Manitowaning (19th-century Odawa "Manidoowaaning"), which is located on Manitoulin Island near the underwater cave where legend has it that the spirit dwells. The modern Odawa name for Manitoulin Island is Mnidoo Mnis, meaning "Spirit Island".<ref></ref>
Manitoulin Island contains a number of lakes of its own. In order of size, its three most prominent lakes are Lake Manitou, Lake Kagawong and Lake Mindemoya. These three lakes in turn have islands within them, the largest of these being Lake Mindemoya's Treasure Island, located in the centre of Manitoulin.
The island is the site of the administrative office of the band government of the Sheshegwaning First Nation.<ref></ref>
