Coccidioidomycosis , , commonly known as cocci,<ref name=Malo2014/> Valley fever,<ref name="Malo2014" /> as well as California fever,<ref name="Bolognia" /> desert rheumatism,<ref name="Bolognia" /> or San Joaquin Valley fever,<ref name="Bolognia"></ref> is a mammalian mycosis caused by Coccidioides immitis or Coccidioides posadasii.<ref name=Nguyen2013></ref> Coccidioidomycosis is endemic in certain parts of the United States in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and northern Mexico.<ref name=Hector_2005></ref>
C. immitis is a dimorphic saprophytic fungus that grows as a mycelium in the soil and produces a spherule form in the host organism. It resides in the soil in certain parts of the southwestern United States, most notably in California and Arizona.<ref name=Malo2014/> It is also commonly found in northern Mexico, and parts of Central and South America.<ref name=Malo2014/> C. immitis is dormant during long dry spells, then develops as a mold with long filaments that break off into airborne spores when it rains. The spores, known as arthroconidia, are swept into the air by disruption of the soil, such as during construction, farming, or an earthquake.<ref></ref> Windstorms may also cause epidemics far from endemic areas. In December 1977, a windstorm in an endemic area around Arvin, California led to several hundred cases, including deaths, in non-endemic areas hundreds of miles away.<ref></ref>
Coccidioidomycosis is a common cause of community acquired pneumonia in the endemic areas of the United States.<ref name=Malo2014></ref> Infections usually occur due to inhalation of the arthroconidial spores after soil disruption.<ref name=Malo2014/> The disease is not contagious.<ref name=Malo2014/> In some cases the infection may recur or become chronic.
