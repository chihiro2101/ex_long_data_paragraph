As a form of inquiry, ethnography relies heavily on participant observationâ€”on the researcher participating in the setting or with the people being studied, at least in some marginal role, and seeking to document, in detail, patterns of social interaction and the perspectives of participants, and to understand these in their local contexts. It had its origin in social and cultural anthropology in the early twentieth century, but spread to other social science disciplines, notably sociology, during the course of that century.
Ethnographers mainly use qualitative methods, though they may also employ quantitative data. The typical ethnography is a holistic study<ref name="Ember 2006">Ember, Carol and Melvin Ember, Cultural Anthropology (Prentice Hall, 2006), chapter one.</ref><ref name="Heider, Karl 2001">Heider, Karl. Seeing Anthropology. 2001. Prentice Hall, Chapters One and Two.</ref> and so includes a brief history, and an analysis of the terrain, the climate, and the habitat. A wide range of group and organisation have been studied by this method, including traditional communities, youth gangs, religious cults, and organisations of various kinds. While, traditionally, ethnography has relied on the physical presence of the researcher in a setting, there is research using the label that has relied on interviews or documents, sometimes to investigate events in the past such as the NASA Challenger disaster.<ref>Vaughan, D. (2016) The Challenger Launch Decision; Risky technology, culture, and deviance at NASA, Second edition, Chicago ILL, University of Chicago Press.</ref> There is also a considerable amount of 'virtual' or online ethnography, sometimes labelled netnography or cyber-ethnography.
