The Welsh Corgi <ref name=":0"></ref> sometimes known as Corgi, plural Corgis, or occasionally the etymologically consistent "Corgwn"; is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales.<ref></ref> Two separate breeds are recognised: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. There are physical differences between the two. According to the breed standards, overall the Cardigan is larger, both in weight and in height. Their tails are of different shapes; docking had previously been used.
The Pembroke is the more popular of the two, yet still appears on The Kennel Club's Vulnerable dog breeds of the United Kingdom list.<ref></ref>
The Pembroke Welsh Corgi gained in popularity because the Queen has personally owned more than 30 Pembrokes or Corgi-Dachshund crosses, known as dorgis. Historically, the Pembroke has been attributed to the influx of dogs alongside Flemish weavers from around the 10th century, while the Cardigan is attributed to the dogs brought with Norse settlers, in particular a common ancestor of the Swedish Vallhund.
