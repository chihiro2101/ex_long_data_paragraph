Skald, or skáld (Old Norse: , later ; , meaning "poet"), is generally a term used for poets who composed at the courts of Scandinavian leaders during the Viking Age, 793–1066 AD, and continuing into the Middle Ages (5th century – 15th century). Skaldic poetry forms one of two main groupings of Old Norse poetry, the other being the anonymous Poetic Edda.<ref name="Store norske leksikon"></ref>

The most prevalent metre of skaldic poetry is dróttkvætt. The subject is usually historical and encomium, detailing the deeds of the skald's patron. There is no evidence that the skalds employed musical instruments, but some speculate that they may have accompanied their verses with the harp or lyre.<ref name="Helle2003"></ref><ref></ref>
