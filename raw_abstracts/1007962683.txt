The members are now part of two phyla the Mucoromycota and Zoopagomycota.<ref name=Spatafora></ref> Approximately 1060 species are known.<ref name="Krogh2010"></ref> They are mostly terrestrial in habitat, living in soil or on decaying plant or animal material. Some are parasites of plants, insects, and small animals, while others form symbiotic relationships with plants.<ref></ref> Zygomycete hyphae may be coenocyte, forming septa only where gametes are formed or to wall off dead hyphae. Zygomycota is no longer recognised as it was not believed to be truly monophyletic.<ref name=Spatafora/>
