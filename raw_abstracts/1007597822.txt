The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. In operation since before 1985, NTP is one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use. NTP was designed by David L. Mills of the University of Delaware.
NTP is intended to synchronize all participating computers to within a few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).<ref name="Mills2010" /> It uses the intersection algorithm, a modified version of Marzullo's algorithm, to select accurate time servers and is designed to mitigate the effects of variable network latency. NTP can usually maintain time to within tens of milliseconds over the public Internet, and can achieve better than one millisecond accuracy in local area networks under ideal conditions. Asymmetric routes and network congestion can cause errors of 100&nbsp;ms or more.<ref name="summary"></ref><ref name="faq"></ref>
The protocol is usually described in terms of a client-server model, but can as easily be used in peer-to-peer relationships where both peers consider the other to be a potential time source.<ref name="Mills2010" /> Implementations send and receive timestamps using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on port number 123.<ref name="qNvGW"></ref><ref name="b66wS"></ref> They can also use broadcasting or multicasting, where clients passively listen to time updates after an initial round-trip calibrating exchange.<ref name="faq" /> NTP supplies a warning of any impending leap second adjustment, but no information about local time zones or daylight saving time is transmitted.<ref name="summary" /><ref name="faq" />
The current protocol is version 4 (NTPv4), which is a proposed standard as documented in . It is backward compatible with version 3, specified in .
