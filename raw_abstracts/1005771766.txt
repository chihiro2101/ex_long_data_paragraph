Pan's People was a British all-female dance troupe most commonly associated with the BBC TV music chart show Top of the Pops, from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s. They appeared on many other TV shows in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, and also performed in nightclub cabaret.
They were the second dance troupe to appear regularly on Top of the Pops, succeeding the Go-Jos in May/June 1968. Starting with monthly appearances, they became a weekly feature of the programme following its revamp and time extension in January 1970, continuing in the show until April 1976. As a result of line-up changes just one dancer, Ruth Pearson, appeared on the whole run.
Due to their weekly exposure on British television the group acquired a high profile, and in addition as a result of the increasing number of preserved recordings from 1973 onwards, the 'classic' line-up which existed from 1972 to 1974 is still widely recognised today. The dancers in this line-up were:
Babs Lord (born 1945) – member 1966–1975<br>
Dee Dee Wilde (born 1946) – member 1966–1975<br>
Ruth Pearson (13 July 1946 – 27 June 2017) – member 1967–1976 and choreographer on some shows 1967–1970<br>
Louise Clarke (3 September 1949 – 25 August 2012) – member 1967–1974<br>
Cherry Gillespie (born 1955) – member 1972–1976
Principal choreographer for Pan's People's entire existence was Flick Colby (23 March 1946 – 26 May 2011), who was also a dancer from 1966–1972.
