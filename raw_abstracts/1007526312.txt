Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is a chronic condition in which stomach contents rise up into the esophagus, resulting in either symptoms or complications.<ref name=NIH2014/><ref name=Kah2008></ref> Symptoms include the taste of acid in the back of the mouth, heartburn, halitosis, chest pain, regurgitation, breathing problems, and wearing away of the teeth.<ref name=NIH2014/> Complications include esophagitis, esophageal stricture, and Barrett's esophagus.<ref name=NIH2014/>
Risk factors include obesity, pregnancy, smoking, hiatal hernia, and taking certain medicines.<ref name=NIH2014></ref> Medications involved may include antihistamines, calcium channel blockers, antidepressants and sleeping pills.<ref name=NIH2014/> Acid reflux is due to poor closure of the esophagus#Sphincters, which is at the junction between the stomach and the esophagus.<ref name=NIH2014/> Diagnosis among those who do not improve with simpler measures may involve gastroscopy, upper GI series, esophageal pH monitoring, or esophageal manometry.<ref name=NIH2014/>
Treatment options include lifestyle changes; medications; and sometimes surgery for those who do not improve with the first two measures.<ref name=NIH2014/> Lifestyle changes include not lying down for three hours after eating, raising the head of the bed, losing weight, avoiding foods which result in symptoms, and stopping smoking.<ref name=NIH2014/> Medications include antacids, H2 antagonist, proton pump inhibitors, and prokinetics.<ref name=NIH2014/><ref name=Her2011></ref>
In the Western world, between 10 and 20% of the population is affected by GERD.<ref name=Her2011/> Occasional gastroesophageal reflux without troublesome symptoms or complications is even more common.<ref name=NIH2014/> The classic symptoms of GERD were first described in 1925, when Friedenwald and Feldman commented on heartburn and its possible relationship to a hiatal hernia.<ref></ref> In 1934 gastroenterologist Asher Winkelstein described reflux and attributed the symptoms to stomach acid.<ref></ref>
