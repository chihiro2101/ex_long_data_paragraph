In 1897, psychologists G. Stanley Hall and Arthur Allin described a "tickle" as two different types of phenomena.<ref>Hall, G. S., and A. Allin. 1897. The psychology of tickling, laughing and the comic. The American Journal of Psychology 9:1-42.</ref> One type is caused by very light movement across the skin. This type of tickle, called a knismesis, generally does not produce laughter and is sometimes accompanied by an itching sensation.
