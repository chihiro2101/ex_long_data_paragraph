In publishing, a colophon <ref></ref> is a brief statement containing information about the publication of a book such as the place of publication, the publisher, and the date of publication. A colophon may include the device of a printer or publisher. Colophons are correctly printed at the ends of books (see History below for the origin of the word), but sometimes the same information appears elsewhere (when it may still be referred to as colophon) and many modern (post-1800) books bear this information on the verso of the title-leaf,<ref>Carter, John (2004), ABC for book-collectors (eighth edition, edited by Nicolas Barker, London: British Library; New Castle: Oak Knoll), p. 68.</ref> which is sometimes called a "biblio-page" or (when bearing copyright data) the "copyright-page".<ref>John Peacock and Michael Barnard (1990), The Blueprint dictionary of printing and publishing (London etc: Blueprint), pp. 25, 60.</ref>
