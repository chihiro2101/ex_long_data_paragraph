Cotton Lyndal Hill (born December 7, 1927) is a Character (arts) in the Fox animated series King of the Hill voiced by Toby Huss. He is the father of Hank Hill, Good Hank Hill (or "G.H."), Junichiro (his illegitimate half-Japanese son), and, according to him, 270 possible others. He is also a World War II veteran, who had his shins "blowed off by a Japanman's machine gun" in combat and later had his feet attached to his knees. This made him a foot shorter than his relatives and caused a characteristic waddle. According to Hank, Cotton was 6&nbsp;ft. 4 in. (1.93 m) with his shins and was 5&nbsp;ft. (1.5 m) without them. Despite his disability, he eventually reached the rank of Colonel in the Texas State Guard and was addressed as such by his friends. Cotton Hill dies in the 12th season of King of the Hill at age 71.
