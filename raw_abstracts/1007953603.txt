The Fourth Macedonian War (150 BC to 148 BC) was fought between the Roman Republic and a Macedonian uprising led by the Macedonian pretender to the throne, Andriscus. Pretending to be a descendant of the former ruling dynasty of Macedon, the Antigonid dynasty which had been deposed by the Romans after the Third Macedonian War in 168 BC, Andriscus sought to re-establish the old Macedonian Kingdom.<ref>Goldsworthy, In the Name of Rome, p. 218</ref> In the process he destabilised Macedonia and much of the Macedonian world. After some early successes, he was eventually defeated by the Romans at the Second Battle of Pydna in 148 BC, leading to the collapse of the uprising. Two years later, Macedonia became a Roman province.
