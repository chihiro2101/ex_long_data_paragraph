Tiến Quân Ca, known in English as the Army Marching Song, Song of Marching Army or Song of Advancing Soldiers, is the National Anthem of Vietnam (SRV), both written and composed by Văn Cao in 1944. The "Army Marching Song" was adopted as the national anthem of North Vietnam in 1954, and was adopted as the national anthem of the new unified Vietnam in 1976, following the reunification of both North Vietnam and South Vietnam at the end of the Vietnam War. Though it has two verses, the first one is mainly sung.
