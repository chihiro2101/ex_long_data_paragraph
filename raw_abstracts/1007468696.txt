A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous vehicle (AV or auto), driverless car, or robo-car<ref name=":5"></ref><ref></ref><ref name="thrun2010toward"></ref> is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input.<ref name="Platoon" /><ref></ref>
Self-driving cars combine a variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as radar, lidar, sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units.<ref name=":5" /><ref name="Platoon"></ref> Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.<ref name="Platoon" /><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref name=":7"></ref>
Possible implementations of the technology include personal self-driving vehicles, shared robotaxis, connected vehicle platoons and long-distance trucking.<ref name="Platoon" /> Several projects to develop a fully self-driving commercial car are in various stages of development. Waymo became the first service provider to offer robotaxi rides to the general public in Phoenix, Arizona in 2020, while Tesla has said it will offer subscription-based "full self-driving" to private vehicle owners in 2021.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Furthermore, the autonomous delivery company Nuro has been allowed to start commercial operations in California starting in 2021.<ref></ref>
