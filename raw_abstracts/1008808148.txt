The Assize of Clarendon was an act of Henry II of England in 1166 that began a transformation of English law and led to Jury trial in common law countries worldwide, and that established assize courts. 
Prior systems for deciding the winning party in a case, especially felony, included trial by ordeal, by battle, or compurgation, in which evidence, inspection, and inquiry was made under oath by laymen, knights or ordinary freemen. After the Assize of Clarendon Jury trial developed, though some historians say beginnings of the jury system predate this act.<ref>cf. the debate between Stubbes, Powicke and Maitland, 'The Jury of Presentment and the Assize of Clarendon', N. Hurnard (1941), EHR vol.56, no.223, pp.374-410.</ref> The Assize of Clarendon did not lead to this change immediately; recourse to trial by combat was not officially rescinded until 1819, though by then it had fallen out of use. 
The assize takes its name from Clarendon Palace, Wiltshire, the royal hunting lodge at which it was promulgated.
