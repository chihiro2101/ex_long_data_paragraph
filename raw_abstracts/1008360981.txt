Luteinizing hormone (LH, also known as lutropin and sometimes lutrophin<ref></ref>) is a hormone produced by gonadotropic cells in the anterior pituitary gland. The production of LH is regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus.<ref></ref> In females, an acute rise of LH ("LH surge") triggers ovulation<ref name="Georgia"></ref> and development of the corpus luteum. In males, where LH had also been called interstitial cellâ€“stimulating hormone (ICSH),<ref></ref> it stimulates Leydig cell production of testosterone.<ref name="Georgia" /> It acts synergistically with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).
