Khutbah khuá¹­bah, serves as the primary formal occasion for public sermon in the Islamic tradition.
Such sermons occur regularly, as prescribed by the teachings of all legal schools. The Islamic tradition can be formally observed at the Dhuhr (noon) congregation Jumu'ah. In addition, similar sermons are called for on the Muslim holidays and after Solar and Lunar Eclipse prayer.
