Image:Riemann-Zeta-Func.png|right|thumb|250px|The Riemann zeta function, subject of the celebrated and influential unsolved problem known as the Riemann hypothesisSince the Renaissance, every century has seen the solution of more mathematical problems than the century before, yet many mathematical problems, both major and minor, still remain unsolved.<ref>Eves, An Introduction to the History of Mathematics 6th Edition, Thomson, 1990, .</ref> These unsolved problems occur in multiple domains, including physics, computer science, algebra, analysis, combinatorics, algebraic, differential, discrete and Euclidean geometry, graph, group, model, number, set and Ramsey theories, dynamical systems, partial differential equations, and more. Some problems may belong to more than one discipline of mathematics and be studied using techniques from different areas. Prizes are often awarded for the solution to a long-standing problem, and lists of unsolved problems (such as the list of Millennium Prize Problems) receive considerable attention.
This article is a composite of unsolved problems derived from many sources, including but not limited to lists considered authoritative. It does not claim to be comprehensive, it may not always be quite up to date, and it includes problems which are considered by the mathematical community to be widely varying in both difficulty and centrality to the science as a whole.
