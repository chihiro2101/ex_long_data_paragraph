George Powers Cockcroft (November 15, 1932 – November 6, 2020), widely known by the pen name Luke Rhinehart, was an American novelist, screenwriter, and nonfiction writer,<ref name=guardian2></ref> with at least ten books to his name. He is best known for his 1971 novel The Dice Man, the story of a psychiatrist who experiments with making life decisions based on the roll of a die,<ref name=guardian3></ref> including, near the novel's onset, the rape of his best friend's wife.<ref name=Independent1/>
Cockcroft has described the origin of the idea for this work variously,<ref>For a more complete discussion, see the Wikipedia article, The Dice Man, and references therein.</ref><ref>For an account that describes the origin of the idea in the years between Cockcroft's teens and early twenties in a self-help effort to move him away from shyness and uptightness through risk-taking, in areas such as "what to read, where to go, how to react to people," see Adams, The Guardian, 27 August 2000, op. cit.</ref><ref>For an account that describes the origin of the idea in Cockcroft's college years, in as a way to decide what he and his friends would do together socially, or to decide between slightly mischieveous dates, see Carrère, The Guardian, 7 November 2019, op. cit.</ref><ref>For an account that describes the origin of the idea in Cockcroft at the age of 16 years, likewise in an effort to move him away, first, from procrastination, and later, from shyness, see Gold, The Guardian, 4 March 2017, op. cit.</ref> however, at the time of the publication of this work, "it was not clear whether the book was fiction or autobiography", all the more because its protagonist and author were eponymous, both were described as having the same profession (psychiatry), and elements of the described lives of both (e.g., places of residence, date of birth) were also in common;<ref name=guardian2/><ref name=guardian3/> hence, curiosity over its authorship have persisted since its publication.<ref name=guardian2/><ref name=guardian3/> Emmanuel Carrère, writing for The Guardian, presented a long-form expose on Cockcroft and the relationship between author and legend in 2019, and in following others,<ref name=guardian1/><ref name=guardian3/> established the author Cockcroft as a life-long English professor living "in an old farmhouse with a yard that slopes down to a duck pond", a husband of fifty-years, father of three, and a caregiver to a special needs child.<ref name=guardian2/><ref name=guardian1></ref><ref name=guardian3/>
The Dice Man was critically well received. It quickly became,<ref name=TheTimes1></ref> and remains thought of as a cult classic.<ref name=telegraph1></ref><ref name=Fann2011></ref> It initially sold poorly in the United States, but well in Europe, particularly England, Sweden, Denmark, and Spain.<ref name=guardian1/> Writing in 2017 for The Guardian, Tanya Gold noted that "over the course of 45 years" it was still in print, had become famous, had devoted fans, and had "sold more than 2m copies in multiple languages"<ref name=guardian1/> (e.g., as many as 27 languages and 60 countries have been claimed<ref></ref>). In 1995, the BBC called it "one of the fifty most influential books of the last half of the twentieth century,"<ref></ref> and in 1999, after one of their reporters experimented, controversially, with dicing,<ref name = guardian4></ref> Loaded magazine named it "Novel of the Century".<ref name = funtriviaLoaded></ref> In 2013, Alex Clark of the Telegraph chose it as one of the fifty greatest cult books of the last hundred years.<ref name=telegraph1/>
Cockcroft continued themes—both comical and philosophical—introduced in The Dice Man—in two later novels, Adventures of Wim (1986) and The Search for the Dice Man (1993), as well as in a companion title, The Book of the Die (2000),<ref name=guardian3/> none of which achieved the commercial success of The Dice Man.<ref name=guardian2/> First published in 1971, The Dice Man was twice spoken of in the early 2000s as enjoying a renaissance,<ref name=guardian3/><ref name=Independent1></ref> though a scholar writing on the subject has indicated no formal evidence for such.<ref name=RobinsonConfProc/>
