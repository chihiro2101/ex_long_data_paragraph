Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, (10 March 15362 June 1572) was an English nobleman and politician. Although from a family with strong Catholic leanings, he was raised a Protestant. He was a second cousin of Queen Elizabeth I through her maternal grandmother, and held many high offices during her reign.
Norfolk was the son of the poet, soldier and politician Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey. He commissioned Thomas Tallis, probably in 1567, to compose his renowned motet in forty voice-parts, Spem in alium.
He was executed for his role in the Ridolfi plot.
