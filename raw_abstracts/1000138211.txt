Les Nabis (French: les nabis, were a group of young French artists active in Paris from 1888 until 1900, who played a large part in the transition from impressionism and academic art to abstract art, symbolism and the other early movements of modernism. The members included Pierre Bonnard, Maurice Denis, Paul Ranson, Édouard Vuillard, Ker-Xavier Roussel, Félix Vallotton, Paul Sérusier and Auguste Cazalis.<ref> urltoken Symbolist Art Theories: A Critical Anthology, edited by Henri Dorra, p.352</ref> Most were students at the Académie Julian in Paris in the late 1880s. The artists shared a common admiration for Paul Gauguin and Paul Cézanne and a determination to renew the art of painting, but varied greatly in their individual styles. They believed that a work of art was not a depiction of nature, but a synthesis of metaphors and symbols created by the artist.<ref> urltoken Nabis, French artists in Encyclopædia Britannica online edition</ref> In 1900, the artists held their final exhibition and went their separate ways.<ref name="Daphne">Bétard, Daphne, La révolution Nabie, in Les Nabis et le décor, Beaux-Arts Éditions, pp. 8-21</ref>
