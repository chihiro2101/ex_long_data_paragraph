An alluvial fan is an accumulation of sediments shaped like a section of a shallow cone,<ref name="boggs-2006-246-250"></ref> with its apex at a point source of sediments, such as a narrow canyon emerging from an escarpment.<ref name="leeder-2011-282-294"></ref> They are characteristic of mountainous terrain in arid to semiarid climates,<ref name="shelton-1966-154"></ref><ref name="blatt-etal-1980-629-632"></ref> but are also found in more humid environments subject to intense rainfall<ref name="boggs-2006-246-250"/> and in areas of modern glaciation.<ref name="blatt-etal-1980-629-632"/> They range in area from less than <ref name="blatt-etal-1980-629-632"/><ref name=":1" /> to almost .<ref name="leeder-2011-285">Leeder 2011, p.285</ref>
Alluvial fans typically form where flow emerges from a confined channel and is free to spread out and infiltrate the surface. This reduces the carrying capacity of the flow and results in deposition of sediments.<ref name="boggs-2006-246-250"/> The flow can take the form of infrequent debris flows or one or more ephemeral or perennial streams.<ref name="leeder-2011-285"/>
Alluvial fans are common in the geologic record, such as in the Triassic basins of eastern North America and the New Red Sandstone of south Devon.<ref name="blatt-etal-1980-631"/> Such fan deposits likely contain the largest accumulations of gravel in the geologic record.<ref name="leeder-2011-290">Leeder 2011, p.290</ref>
Some of the largest alluvial fans are found along the Himalaya mountain front on the Indo-Gangetic plain.<ref name="leeder-2011-285"/> A shift of the feeder channel (a nodal avulsion) can lead to catastrophic flooding, as occurred on the Kosi River fan in 2008.<ref name="leeder-2011-289">Leeder 2011, p.289</ref>
