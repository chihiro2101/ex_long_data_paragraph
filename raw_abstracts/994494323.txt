Sea cucumbers can be found in great numbers on the deep seafloor, where they often make up the majority of the animal biomass.<ref></ref> At depths deeper than , sea cucumbers comprise 90% of the total mass of the macrofauna.<ref></ref> Sea cucumbers form large herds that move across the bathygraphic features of the ocean, hunting food. The body of some deep water holothurians, such as Enypniastes eximia, Peniagone leander and Paelopatides confundens,<ref></ref> is made of a tough gelatinous tissue with unique properties that makes the animals able to control their own buoyancy, making it possible for them to either live on the ocean floor or to actively swim <ref>Blue Planet Discovery Channel</ref> or float over it in order to move to new locations,<ref></ref> in a manner similar to how the group Torquaratoridae floats through water.
Holothurians appear to be the echinoderms best adapted to extreme depths, and are still very diversified beyond 5,000 m deep: several species from the family Elpidiidae ("sea pigs") can be found deeper than 9,500 m, and the record seems to be some species of the genus Myriotrochus (in particular Myriotrochus bruuni), identified down to 10,687 meters deep.<ref name="MahDeepest"></ref>
In more shallow waters, sea cucumbers can form dense populations. The strawberry sea cucumber (Squamocnus brevidentis) of New Zealand lives on rocky walls around the southern coast of the South Island where populations sometimes reach densities of 1,000 animals per square meter (93 /sq ft). For this reason, one such area in Fiordland is called the strawberry fields.<ref></ref>
