The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC; French: Chambre de commerce internationale) is the largest, most representative Trade association in the world.<ref> urltoken International Chamber Of Commerce (ICC) Definition. Investopedia (2011-04-21). Retrieved on 2013-07-19.</ref> Its over 45 million members in over 100 countries have interests spanning every sector of private enterprise.
ICC's current chairman is Ajaypal Singh Banga<ref></ref> and John W.H. Denton AO is the current Secretary General.
ICC has three main activities: rule setting, dispute resolution, and policy advocacy. Because its member companies and associations are themselves engaged in international business, ICC has unrivalled authority in making rules that govern the conduct of business across borders. Although these rules are voluntary, they are observed in thousands of transactions every day and have become part of international trade.
A world network of national committees in over 100 countries advocates business priorities at national and regional level. More than 3,000 experts drawn from ICC's member companies feed their knowledge and experience into crafting the ICC stance on specific business issues.
ICC supports the work of the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, and many other intergovernmental bodies, both international and regional, such as G20<ref></ref> on behalf of international business. ICC was the first organization granted general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council and UN Observer Status.<ref></ref>
