Liriodendron <ref>Sunset Western Garden Book, 1995:606â€“607</ref> is a genus of two species of characteristically large trees, deciduous over most of their populations, in the magnolia family (Magnoliaceae).
These trees are widely known by the common name tulip tree or tuliptree for their large flowers superficially resembling tulips. It is sometimes referred to as tulip poplar or yellow poplar, and the wood simply as "poplar", although not closely related to the true Populus. Other common names include canoewood, saddle-leaf tree, and white wood.
The botanical name Liriodendron tulipifera originates from Greek: Liriodendron, which means lilytree, and tulipifera which means "bringing forth tulips", alluding to the resemblance of its flowers to a tulip.
The two extant species are Liriodendron tulipifera, native to eastern North America and Liriodendron chinense, native to China and Vietnam. Both species often grow to great size, the North American species may reach as much as in height.<ref> urltoken The North American species is commonly used horticulture, the Chinese species is increasing in cultivation, and hybrids have been produced between these two allopatry distributed species.
Various extinct species of Liriodendron have been described from the fossil record.
