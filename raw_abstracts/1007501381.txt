The Phillips curve is a single-equation economic model, named after William
Phillips, describing an inverse relationship between rates of unemployment and corresponding rates of rises in wages that result within an economy. Stated simply, decreased unemployment, (i.e., increased levels of employment) in an economy will correlate with higher rates of wage rises.<ref>AW Phillips, ‘The Relation between Unemployment and the Rate of Change of Money Wage Rates in the United Kingdom 1861–1957’ (1958) urltoken 25 Economica 283, referring to unemployment and the "change of money wage rates".</ref> Phillips did not himself state there was any relationship between employment and inflation; this notion was a trivial deduction from his statistical findings. Samuelson and Solow made the connection explicit and subsequently Milton Friedman<ref name="FriedmanRole"></ref> 
and Edmund Phelps<ref name="PhelpsMoneyWage"></ref><ref name="PhelpsPhillips"></ref>
put the theoretical structure in place. In so doing, Friedman was to successfully predict the imminent collapse of Phillips' a-theoretic correlation.
While there is a short run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation, it has not been observed in the long run.<ref name=chang>Chang, R. (1997) urltoken "Is Low Unemployment Inflationary?" Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Economic Review 1Q97:4-13</ref> In 1967 and 1968, Friedman and Phelps asserted that the Phillips curve was only applicable in the short-run and that, in the long-run, inflationary policies would not decrease unemployment.<ref name="FriedmanRole" /><ref name="PhelpsMoneyWage" /><ref name="PhelpsPhillips" /><ref name="Phelan"></ref> Friedman then correctly predicted that in the 1973–75 recession, both Stagflation.<ref name="Phelan"/> The long-run Phillips curve is now seen as a vertical line at the natural rate of unemployment, where the rate of inflation has no effect on unemployment.<ref></ref> In the 2010s<ref></ref> the slope of the Phillips curve appears to have declined and there has been controversy over the usefulness of the Phillips curve in predicting inflation. Nonetheless, the Phillips curve remains the primary framework for understanding and forecasting inflation used in central banks.<ref></ref>
