In economics, an absentee landlord is a person who owns and rents out a profit-earning property, but does not live within the property's local economic region. The term "absentee ownership" was popularised by economist Thorstein Veblen's 1923 book of the same name, Absentee Ownership.<ref></ref>
When used in a local context, the term refers to a landlord of a house or other real estate, who leases the property to tenants, but fails to ensure that proper maintenance is done on it, or does only the minimum required by law (the term slumlord is also used to describe such a person). This, in turn, leads to what may appear to be abandoned buildings, causing significantly lowered property values and urban blight.
Overall, tax policy seems to favour absentee ownership.<ref></ref> However, some jurisdictions seek to extract money from absentee owners by taxing land.<ref></ref> Absentee ownership has sometimes put the absentee owners at risk of loss.<ref></ref>
