Open theism, also known as openness theology and free will theism,<ref></ref> is a theological movement that has developed within Christianity as a rejection to the synthesis of Greek philosophy and Christian theology. Open theism is typically advanced as a biblically motivated and philosophically consistent theology of human and divine freedom (in the libertarian sense), with an emphasis on what this means for the content of God's foreknowledge and exercise of God's power.<ref name="reknew.org"></ref>
Noted Open Theist theologian Thomas Jay Oord identifies four paths to open and relational theology:<ref></ref>
# following the biblical witness,
# following themes in some Christian theological traditions,
# following the philosophy of free will, and
# following the path of reconciling faith and science.
Roger E. Olson said that open theism triggered the "most significant controversy about the doctrine of God in evangelical thought" in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.<ref></ref>
