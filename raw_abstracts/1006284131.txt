In the modern English-language's usage of the word, a tyrant (derived from Ancient Greek , tyrannos) is an absolute ruler who is unrestrained by law, or one who has usurped a legitimate ruler's sovereignty. Often portrayed as cruel, tyrants may defend their positions by resorting to repressive means.<ref>: "TYRANT (Gr. τύραννος, master, ruler), a term applied in modern times to a ruler of a cruel and oppressive character."</ref><ref>Compare: </ref> The original Greek term meant an absolute sovereign who came to power without constitutional right,<ref></ref><ref></ref> The Encyclopédie defined the term as a usurper of sovereign power who makes "his subjects the victims of his passions and unjust desires, which he substitutes for laws".<ref>Compare: </ref>
In the late fifth and fourth centuries BC, a new kind of tyrant, one who had the support of the military, arose – specifically in Sicily.
One can apply accusations of tyranny to a variety of types of government:
* to government by one individual (in an autocracy)
* to government by a minority (in an oligarchy, tyranny of the minority)
* to government by a majority (in a democracy, tyranny of the majority)
The existence of tyranny would call the legitimacy of the democratic process into question and would 'invite resistance and protest rather than acceptance' of the process's results."<ref></ref>
