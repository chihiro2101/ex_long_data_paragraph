The Basic Laws of Sweden are the four fundamental laws of the Sweden that regulate the Politics of Sweden, acting in a similar manner to the constitutions of most countries. These are the Instrument of Government , the Freedom of the Press Act , the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression and the Act of Succession . Together, they constitute a basic framework that stands above other laws and regulation, and also define which agreements are themselves above normal Swedish law.
The Parliament Act is usually considered to be halfway between a fundamental law and a normal law, with certain main chapters afforded similar protections as the fundamental laws while other additional chapters require only a simple parliamentary majority.<ref name="fifteen_p808"></ref>
To amend or to revise a fundamental law, the Riksdag needs to approve the changes twice in two successive terms with qualified majorities, with a general election having been held in between. The first vote can be replaced with a referendum.<ref name=fifteen_p808/>
