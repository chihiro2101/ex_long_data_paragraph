Anna Komnene ; 1 December 1083 – 1150s), commonly Latinized as Anna Comnena, was a Byzantine princess and author of the Alexiad, an account of the reign of her father, the Byzantine emperor, Alexios I Komnenos. The Alexiad is the most important primary source of Byzantine history of the late 11th and early 12th centuries. Although she is best known as the author of the Alexiad, Anna played an important part in the politics of the time and attempted to depose her brother, John II Komnenos, as emperor and seize the throne herself.<ref name=":23">Hanawalt 1982, p. 303.</ref>
At birth, Anna was betrothed to Constantine Doukas,<ref name=":23">Hanawalt 1982, p. 303.</ref> and she grew up in his mother's household.<ref name=":0">Neville 2016, p. 2.</ref> She was well-educated in "Greek literature and history, philosophy, theology, mathematics, and medicine."<ref name=":23" /> Anna and Constantine were next in the line to throne until Anna's younger brother, John II Komnenos, became the heir in 1092. Constantine died around 1094, and Anna married Nikephoros Bryennios in 1097.<ref name=":4">Neville 2016, p. 3.</ref> The two had several children before Nikephoros' death around 1136.
Following her father's death in 1118, Anna and her mother attempted to usurp John II Komnenos.<ref>Larmour 2004, pp. 203–205.</ref> Her husband refused to cooperate with them, and the usurpation failed.<ref name=":23" /> As a result, John exiled Anna to the Kecharitomene Monastery, where she spent the rest of her life.
In confinement there, she wrote the Alexiad.<ref name=":3">Larmour 2004, p. 204.</ref>
She died sometime in the 1150s; the exact date is unknown.<ref name=":5">Neville 2016, p. 5.</ref>
