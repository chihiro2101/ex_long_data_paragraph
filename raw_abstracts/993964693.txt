The Financial Services Authority (FSA) was a quasi-judicial body responsible for the regulation of the financial services industry in the United Kingdom between 2001 and 2013. It was founded as the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) in 1985. Its board was appointed by the Treasury, although it operated independently of government. It was structured as a company limited by guarantee and was funded entirely by fees charged to the financial services industry.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
Due to perceived regulatory failure of the banks during the financial crisis of 2007â€“2008, the UK government decided to restructure financial regulation and abolish the FSA.<ref name=20100616ft></ref> On 19 December 2012, the Financial Services Act 2012 received royal assent, abolishing the FSA with effect from 1 April 2013.
