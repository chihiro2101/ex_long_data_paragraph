Robert Fludd, also known as Robertus de Fluctibus (17 January 1574 &ndash; 8 September 1637), was a prominent English Paracelsian physician with both scientific and occult interests. He is remembered as an astrologer, mathematician, cosmologist, Qabalist and Rosicrucian apologist.
Fludd is best known for his compilations in occult philosophy. He had a celebrated exchange of views with Johannes Kepler concerning the scientific and hermetic approaches to knowledge.<ref>Wolfgang Pauli, Wolfgang Pauli â€“ Writings on physics and philosophy, translated by Robert Schlapp and edited by P.
