In topology, knot theory is the study of mathematical knots. While inspired by knots which appear in daily life, such as those in shoelaces and rope, a mathematical knot differs in that the ends are joined together so that it cannot be undone, Unknot. In mathematical language, a knot is an embedding of a circle in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, <math>\mathbb^n</math> embedded in <math>\R^m</math>, where k is a natural number. Both the <math>m=n+2</math> and the <math>m>n+2</math> cases are well studied, and so is the <math>n>1</math> case.<ref> — An introductory article to high dimensional knots and links for the advanced readers</ref><ref> — An introductory article to high dimensional knots and links for beginners</ref>
