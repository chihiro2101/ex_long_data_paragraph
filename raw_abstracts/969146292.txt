Aleister Crowley, the founder of Thelema, designated his works as belonging to one of several classes. Not all of his work was placed in a class by him.
:Class A consists of works that are not to be changed, even to the letter. The Holy Books fall in this category.
:Class B consists of works of scholarship and enlightenment.
:Class C consists of material that suggests things other than the obvious.
:Class D consists of official rituals and instructions.
:Class E consists of manifestos, broadsides, epistles and other public statements.
