In the Lebor Gabála Érenn, a medieval Irish Christian pseudo-history, the Milesians are the final race to settle in Ireland. They represent the Irish people. The Milesians are Gaels who sail to Ireland from Iberia (Hispania) after spending hundreds of years travelling the earth. When they land in Ireland they contend with the Tuatha Dé Danann, who represent the pagan gods. The two groups agree to divide Ireland between them: the Milesians take the world above, while the Tuath Dé take the world below (i.e. the Otherworld). 
Whether the word "Milesians" came before or after the name Míl Espáine, which is the Irish form of the Latin Miles Hispaniae ("Soldier of Hispania") is uncertain. Joseph Lennon writes that "no Irish-language cognate of the word exists." and that "the word Milesian is not used to refer to the Irish with any regularity until the eighteenth century."<ref name="Lennon"></ref>
Scholars believe that the tale is mostly an invention of medieval Christian writers.<ref name=carey1-4>Carey, John. urltoken The Irish National Origin-Legend: Synthetic Pseudohistory. University of Cambridge, 1994. pp.1–4</ref><ref name=mythlegendromance></ref>
