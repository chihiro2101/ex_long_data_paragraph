Lusatia , , , , , , , also known as Sorbia, is a historical region in Central Europe, split between Germany and Poland. The region is the home of the ethnic group of Sorbs. It stretches from the Bóbr and Kwisa rivers in the east to the Pulsnitz and Black Elster in the west, today located within the German states of Saxony and Brandenburg as well as in the Lower Silesian and Lubusz voivodeships of western Poland.
Historically, Lusatia belonged to several countries. Being part of the Kingdom of Poland (about 1025), Lands of the Bohemian Crown (the so-called Czech Lands) for three hundred years, alongside them it passed to the Habsburg Monarchy and from it to the Electorate of Saxony. The greater part passed to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815 and the whole region merged into Germany in 1871. After the occupation of Eastern Germany by the Red Army and the partition in 1945, the eastern part of Lusatia along the Lusatian Neisse river was ceded to Poland under the Potsdam Agreement. The newly-established Polish-German border became known as the Oder–Neisse line.
In the Polish part today, as the result of the expulsion of its German-speaking population after 1945 and Polish re-settlement, Polish is spoken, and in the German part German. A minority speaks the Upper- and Lower Sorbian language. The largest Lusatian town is Cottbus (Lower Sorbian: Chóśebuz).
