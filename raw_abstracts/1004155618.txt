Mixed-member proportional representation (MMP or MMPR) is a mixed electoral system in which voters get two votes: one to decide the legislator for their single-seat constituency, and one for a political party. Seats in the legislature are filled firstly by the successful constituency candidates, and secondly, by party candidates based on the percentage of nationwide or region-wide votes that each party received.<ref name=AceMmp></ref><ref name=ShugartMixMember></ref><ref name=BochslerTerritory></ref> The constituency representatives are elected using first-past-the-post voting (FPTP) or another plurality/majoritarian system. The nationwide or region-wide party representatives are, in most jurisdictions, drawn from published party lists, similar to party-list proportional representation. To gain a nationwide representative, parties may be required to achieve a minimum number of constituency candidates, a minimum percentage of the nationwide party vote, or both.
MMP differs from parallel voting in that the nationwide seats are allocated to political party in a compensatory manner in order to achieve proportional representation. Under MMP, two parties that each receive 25% of the votes may both end up with 25% of the seats, even if one party wins more constituencies than the other. Depending on the exact system implemented in a country and the results of a particular election, the proportionality of an election may vary.<ref name="Linhart Raabe Statsch pp. 21–40"></ref> Overhang seats may reduce the proportionality of the system, although this can be compensated for by allocating additional party list seats to cover any proportionality gap.<ref name="Golosov 2013 p.

MMP was originally used to elect representatives to the German Bundestag, and has been adopted by Bolivia, Lesotho and New Zealand. It was also used in Romania during its 2008 and 2012 legislative elections. In Germany, where it is used on the federal level and in most states, MMP is known as personalized proportional representation . In the United Kingdom such systems used in Scotland, Wales, and the London Assembly are referred to as additional member systems.<ref></ref><ref name="Additional-member system: Politics"></ref> In the Canadian province of Quebec, where an MMP model was studied in 2007,<ref></ref> it is called the compensatory mixed-member voting system (système mixte avec compensation or SMAC).
