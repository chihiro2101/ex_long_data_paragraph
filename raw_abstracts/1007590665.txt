The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in Missouri on behalf of Phelps and Westboro Baptist Church to overturn the ban on the picketing of soldier's funerals.<ref></ref> The ACLU of Ohio also filed a similar lawsuit.
In the case of Snyder v. Phelps, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that "distasteful and repugnant" protests surrounding funerals of service members were protected by the First Amendment. But attorneys for the service member's family appealed the decision on the grounds that such speech should not be allowed to inflict emotional distress on private parties exercising their freedom of religion during a funeral service. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case on October 6, 2010 and ruled 8â€“1 in favor of Phelps in an opinion released on March 2, 2011.<ref name="snyder_v_phelps_us_supreme_court_ruling" /><ref name="phelps_dies_2014_03_20_wichita_eagle" /> The court held that "any distress occasioned by Westboro's picketing turned on the content and viewpoint of the message conveyed, rather than any interference with the funeral itself" and thus could not be restricted.<ref name="snyder_v_phelps_us_supreme_court_ruling" /><ref name="upholds_2011_03_02_metro_weekly"></ref><ref name="right_upheld_2011_03_02_cnn"></ref><ref name="why_2011_03_03_time_com"></ref>
