However, this climax is not realized, and the momentum sinks to another lyrical section, bringing back other quotes from the first movement, including fanfares, and "" (see Lieder section), leading to the second theme of the recapitulation, but this time in F major. A brief closing section, in F minor, is heard on the violas, before the above theme returns in the same minor key one last time in the strings from the beginning of the coda, leading to its repetition in D major by the brass and reaching a true climax. The symphony concludes with fanfare material from the beginning.
