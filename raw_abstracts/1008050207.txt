On July 4, 1917 the Smiley Steel Company of New York began demolition of the tower by dynamite it.

George Boldt decided to make the property available for sale. On April 20, 1922, Tesla lost an appeal of judgment on Boldt's foreclosure. This effectively locked Tesla out of any future development of the facility.
