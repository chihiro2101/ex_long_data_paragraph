The separation of commercial and investment banking prevented securities firms and investment banks from taking deposits, and commercial Federal Reserve member banks from:
* dealing in non-governmental securities for customers,
* investing in non-investment grade securities for themselves,
* underwriting or distributing non-governmental securities,
* affiliating (or sharing employees) with companies involved in such activities.
Starting in the early 1960s, federal banking regulators' interpretations of the Act permitted commercial banks, and especially commercial bank affiliates, to engage in an expanding list and volume of securities activities.<ref name="uphold" /> Congressional efforts to "repeal the Glass–Steagall Act", referring to those four provisions (and then usually to only the two provisions that restricted affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms),<ref name="repeal" /> culminated in the 1999 Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA), which repealed the two provisions restricting affiliations between banks and securities firms.<ref name="GLBA" />
By that time, many commentators argued Glass–Steagall was already "dead".<ref name="dead" /> Most notably, Citibank's 1998 affiliation with Salomon Smith Barney, one of the largest US securities firms, was permitted under the Federal Reserve Board's then existing interpretation of the Glass–Steagall Act.<ref name="Citi" /> In November 1999, President Bill Clinton publicly declared "the Glass–Steagall law is no longer appropriate".<ref> </ref><ref></ref>
Some commentators have stated that the GLBA's repeal of the affiliation restrictions of the Glass–Steagall Act was an important cause of the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics laureate Joseph Stiglitz argued that the effect of the repeal was "indirect": "when repeal of Glass-Steagall brought investment and commercial banks together, the investment-bank culture came out on top".<ref name="Kuttner" /><ref name="capitalistfools"></ref> Economists at the Federal Reserve, such as Chairman Ben Bernanke, have argued that the activities linked to the financial crisis were not prohibited (or, in most cases, even regulated) by the Glass–Steagall Act.<ref name="W&M" /><ref></ref><ref name="optimal">Mester, Loretta J.
