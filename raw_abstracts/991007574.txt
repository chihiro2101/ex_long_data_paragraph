An altarpiece is an artwork such as a painting, sculpture or relief representing a religious subject made for placing behind the altar of a Christian church.<ref name=catholic></ref><ref name=britannica></ref><ref name=webster></ref> Though most commonly used for a single work of art such as a painting or sculpture, or a set of them, the word can also be used of the whole ensemble behind an altar, otherwise known as a reredos, including what is often an elaborate frame for the central Religious image. Altarpieces were one of the most important products of Christian art especially from the late Middle Ages to the era of the Counter-Reformation.<ref name=visualartscork></ref>
Many altarpieces have been removed from their church settings, and often from their elaborate sculpted frameworks, and are displayed as more simply framed paintings in museums and elsewhere.
