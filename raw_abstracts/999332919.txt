Image:Old Farmer's Almanac 1793 cover.jpg|frame|The Old Farmer's Almanac is famous in the US for its (not necessarily accurate) long-range weather predictions.
A prediction (Latin pr√¶-, "before," and dicere, "to say"), or forecast, is a statement about a future event. They are often, but not always, based upon experience or knowledge. There is no universal agreement about the exact difference from "estimation"; different authors and disciplines ascribe different connotations.
Although future events are necessarily uncertain, so guaranteed accurate information about the future is impossible. Prediction can be useful to assist in making plans about possible developments; Howard H. Stevenson writes that prediction in business "is at least two things: Important and hard."<ref>Stevenson, Howard, ed. Do lunch or be lunch. Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 1998</ref>
