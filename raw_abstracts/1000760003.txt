Roland Glen "Rollie" Fingers (born August 25, 1946) is an American retired professional baseball pitcher who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball for the Oakland Athletics (1968–1976), San Diego Padres (1977–1980), and Milwaukee Brewers (1981–1985). Fingers's effectiveness as a relief pitcher helped redefine the value of relievers within baseball and helped usher in the modern closer role. He is a three-time World Series champion, a seven-time All-Star, a four-time Rolaids Relief Man Award, and a three-time MLB saves leader. Fingers won the American League's (AL) Most Valuable Player Award and Cy Young Award in 1981.
Fingers retired in 1985 with 341 career saves, the 300 save club until surpassed by Jeff Reardon in 1992. Fingers was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1992, making him just the second reliever elected. He is also one of only a few MLB players to have his number retired by more than one club (Oakland Athletics and Milwaukee Brewers). Fingers is also known for his neatly groomed handlebar mustache.
