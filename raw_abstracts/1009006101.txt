A ship prefix is a combination of letters, usually, abbreviations, used in front of the name of a civilian or naval ship that has historically served numerous purposes, such as identifying the vessel's mode of propulsion, purpose, or ownership/nationality. In the modern environment, prefixes are used inconsistently in civilian service, however, in government service, the vessels prefix is seldom missing due to government regulations dictating a certain prefix be present. Today the common practice is to use a single prefix for all warships of a nation's navy, and other prefixes for auxiliaries and ships of allied services, such as coast guards. For example, the modern navy of Japan adopts the prefix "JS" â€“ Japanese Ship. However, not all navies used prefixes; this includes the significant navies of China, France (though France has a NATO designation for its naval prefix, which is FS (French Ship)), Russia and Spain, which like France uses the NATO designation SPS (Spanish Ship) if needed.
