</ref> Paired birds greet by engaging in up-down and head-shaking crouch displays, and clattering the beak while throwing back the head. Pairs copulate frequently throughout the month before eggs are laid. High-frequency pair copulation is usually associated with sperm competition and high frequency of extra-pair copulation; however, extra-pair copulation is infrequent in white storks.<ref></ref>
A white stork pair raises a single brood a year. The female typically lays four eggs, though clutches of one to seven have been recorded. The eggs are white, but often look dirty or yellowish due to a glutinous covering. They typically measure ,<ref name="Oologia neerlandica" /> and weigh , of which about is shell.<ref name="Oologia neerlandica"></ref> Incubation begins as soon as the first egg is laid, so the brood hatches asynchronously, beginning 33 to 34&nbsp;days later. The first hatchling typically has a competitive edge over the others. While stronger chicks are not aggressive towards weaker siblings, as is the case in some species, weak or small chicks are sometimes killed by their parents.<ref name="Zielinski"></ref><ref></ref> This behaviour occurs in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. White stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. Despite this, this behaviour has not commonly been observed.<ref name="Zielinski" />
The temperature and weather around the time of hatching in spring is important; cool temperatures and wet weather increase chick mortality and reduce breeding success rates.<ref name="Carrascal1993" /> Somewhat unexpectedly, studies have found that later-hatching chicks which successfully reach adulthood produce more chicks than do their earlier-hatching nestmates.<ref></ref> The body weight of the chicks increases rapidly in the first few weeks and reaches a plateau of about in 45&nbsp;days. The length of the beak increases linearly for about 50&nbsp;days.<ref></ref> Young birds are fed with earthworms and insects, which are regurgitated by the parents onto the floor of the nest. Older chicks reach into the mouths of parents to obtain food.<ref></ref> Chicks fledge 58 to 64&nbsp;days after hatching.
White storks generally begin breeding when about four years old, although the age of first breeding has been recorded as early as two years and as late as seven years. The oldest known wild white stork lived for 39 years after being ringed in Switzerland,<ref></ref> while captive birds have lived for more than 35 years.
