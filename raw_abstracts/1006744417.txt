A pipe band is a musical ensemble consisting of pipers and drummers.<ref></ref> The term pipes and drums, used by military pipe bands is also common.
The most common form of pipe band consists of a section of pipers playing the Great Highland bagpipe, a section of snare drummers (often referred to as 'side drummers'), several tenor drummers and usually one, though occasionally two, bass drummers. The tenor drummers and bass drummer are referred to collectively as the 'bass section' (or in North America as the 'midsection'), and the entire drum section is collectively known as the drum corps. The band follows the direction of the pipe major; when on parade the band may be led by a drum major, who directs the band with a mace. Standard instrumentation for a pipe band involves 6 to 25 pipers, 3 to 10 side drummers, 1 to 6 tenor drummers and 1 bass drummer. Occasionally this instrumentation is augmented to include additional instruments (such as additional percussion instruments or keyboard instruments), but this is typically done only in concert settings.
Pipe bands are a long-standing tradition in areas with Celts roots, most notably in Scotland, Ireland, the regions of Galicia, Asturias and Cantabria in Northern Spain. and Brittany in Northwestern France. The tradition is also long-standing in former British colonies such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as constituents of the Commonwealth of Nations.
