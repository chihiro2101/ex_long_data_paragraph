The pleural cavity, pleural space, or interpleural space, is the potential space between the pleurae of the pleural sac that surrounds each lung. A small amount of serous fluid is maintained in the pleural cavity to enable lubrication between the pleurae, and also to create a pressure gradient.<ref name="Saladin"></ref>
The serous membrane that covers the surface of the lung is the visceral pleura and is separated from the outer membrane the parietal pleura by just the film of pleural fluid in the pleural cavity. The visceral pleura follows the fissures of the lung and the root of the lung structures. The parietal pleura is attached to the mediastinum, the upper surface of the diaphragm, and to the inside of the ribcage.<ref name="Saladin"/>
