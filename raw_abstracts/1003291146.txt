Nevada is the only U.S. state where prostitution is legally permitted in some form. Strictly regulated brothels operate legally in mainly isolated rural areas, away from the majority of Nevada's population. However, prostitution is not legal in all of Nevada, and is illegal in the following counties: Clark (which contains Las Vegas), Douglas, Eureka, Lincoln, Pershing and Washoe (which contains Reno). Prostitution is also illegal in Nevada's capital, Carson City, an independent city. The rest of Nevada's counties are permitted by state law to license brothels, but currently only seven counties have active brothels. As of December 2018, there are 21 brothels in Nevada.
Despite there being a legal option, the vast majority of prostitution in Nevada takes place illegally in the metropolitan areas of Las Vegas and Reno. About 66 times more money is spent by customers on illegal prostitution in Nevada than in the regulated brothels.<ref name=Flowers2011/> Some scholars have argued that Nevadaâ€™s brothels should not be seen as aberrant or deviant, "but rather are part and parcel of today's neoliberal consumer economy&nbsp;. in which personal consumer choice is elevated to a moral right."<ref></ref>
