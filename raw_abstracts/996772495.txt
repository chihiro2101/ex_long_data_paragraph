The Oregon Country Fair begins on the Friday of the second weekend in July every year (i.e. as early as July 7 and as late as July 13). The fair is a non-profit organization and as such has a board of directors. Additionally, the management structure of the Oregon Country Fair is typically composed of a General Manager, an Operations Manager, and a team of volunteer Back Up Managers, otherwise known as BUMS, who serve as representation for the fair's paid management staff for the duration of the event. Currently the fair does not have an official General Manager. In the interim, management responsibilities fall to the Operations Manager and the Site Manager who work as a co-management team.
