A grocery store (North America), grocer or grocery shop (UK), is a store primarily engaged in retailing a general range of food products,<ref name=naics/> which may be fresh or packaged. In everyday U.S. usage, however, "grocery store" is a synonym for supermarket,<ref name=oxford/> and is not used to refer to other types of stores that sell groceries. In the UK, shops that sell food are distinguished as grocers<ref name=oxford/> or grocery shops, though in everyday use, people usually use either the term "supermarket" or, for a smaller type of store that sells groceries, a "corner shop"<ref name=corner/> or "convenience shop".
Larger types of stores that sell groceries, such as supermarkets and hypermarkets, usually stock significant amounts of non-food products, such as clothing and household items. Small grocery stores that mainly sell fruits and vegetables are known as greengrocers (Britain) or produce markets (U.S.), and small grocery stores that predominantly sell prepared food, such as candy and snacks, are known as convenience shops or delicatessens.
Some groceries specialize in the foods of certain countries or regions, such as Chinese, Italian, Middle Eastern, or Polish. These stores are known in the U.S. as ethnic markets and may also serve as gathering places for immigrants.<ref name="Carter"></ref>
