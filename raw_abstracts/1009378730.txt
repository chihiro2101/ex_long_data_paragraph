Medb (pronounced —later forms Meḋḃ, Maedhbh , Méabh , Méibh and Maedbh and also Maeve—is queen of Connacht in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. Her husband in the core stories of the cycle is Ailill mac Máta, although she had several husbands before him who were also kings of Connacht. She rules from Cruachan (now Rathcroghan, County Roscommon). She is the enemy (and former wife) of Conchobar mac Nessa, king of Ulster, and is best known for starting the Táin Bó Cúailnge ("The Cattle Raid of Cooley") to steal Ulster's prize stud bull Donn Cúailnge.
Medb is strong-willed, ambitious, cunning and promiscuous, and is an archetypal warrior queen.<ref></ref> She is believed by some to be a manifestation of the sovereignty goddess.<ref name="o hogain">Ó hÓgáin, Dáithí.
