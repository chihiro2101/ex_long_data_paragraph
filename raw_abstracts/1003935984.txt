Female ejaculation is characterized as an expulsion of fluid from the Skene's gland at the lower end of the urethra during or before an orgasm. It is also known colloquially as squirting (or gushing), although research indicates that female ejaculation and squirting are different phenomena, with squirting being attributed to a sudden expulsion of liquid that partly comes from the bladder and contains urine.<ref name="pastor"></ref><ref name="Salama"></ref> Female ejaculation is physiologically distinct from coital incontinence, with which it is sometimes confused.<ref name=Pastor2013></ref><ref name="pmid19170835"> </ref>
There have been few studies on female ejaculation.<ref name="Estupinyà"></ref> A failure to adopt common definitions and research methodology by the scientific community has been the primary contributor to this lack of experimental data.<ref name="Taverner"></ref> Research has suffered from highly selected participants, narrow case studies, or very small sample sizes, and consequently has yet to produce significant results. Much of the research into the composition of the fluid focuses on determining whether it is, or contains, urine.<ref name="Estupinyà"/><ref name="rodriguez"></ref> It is common for any secretion that exits the vagina, and for fluid that exits the urethra, during sexual activity to be referred to as female ejaculate, which has led to significant confusion in the literature.<ref name="rodriguez"/>
Whether the fluid is secreted by the Skene's gland through and around the urethra has also been a topic of discussion; while the exact source and nature of the fluid remain controversial among medical professionals, and are related to doubts over the existence of the G-spot,<ref name="Balon, Segraves"></ref><ref name="Greenberg"></ref><ref name="rodriguez"/> there is substantial evidence that the Skene's gland is the source of female ejaculation.<ref name=pastor/><ref name="rodriguez"/> The function of female ejaculation, however, remains unclear.<ref name="rodriguez"/>
