In these monotheistic religions, idolatry has been considered as the "worship of false gods" and is forbidden by the values such as the Ten Commandments. Other monotheistic religions may apply similar rules.<ref name="mwdoniger497"></ref> In many Indian religions, such as theistic and non-theistic forms of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, idols (murti) are considered as symbolism for the absolute but not The Absolute,<ref name=fowler41/> or icons of spiritual ideas,<ref name=fowler41>Jeaneane D Fowler (1996), Hinduism: Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, , pages 41–45</ref><ref name=wernercort/> or the embodiment of the divine.<ref name=klausklost>Klaus Klostermaier (2010), A Survey of Hinduism, State University of New York Press, , pages 264–267</ref> It is a means to focus one's religious pursuits and worship (bhakti).<ref name=fowler41/><ref name="Gale Encyclopedia of Religion"></ref><ref name=wernercort>Karel Werner (1995), Love Divine: Studies in Bhakti and Devotional Mysticism, Routledge, , pages 45-46;<br>John Cort (2011), Jains in the World, Oxford University Press, , pages 80–85</ref> In the traditional religions of ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, Africa, Asia, the Americas and elsewhere, the reverence of an image or statue has been a common practice, and cult images have carried different meanings and significance.<ref name="Halbertal1992p1"></ref>

The history of religions has been marked with accusations and denials of idolatry. These accusations have considered statues and images to be devoid of symbolism. Alternatively, the topic of idolatry has been a source of disagreements between many religions, or within denominations of various religions, with the presumption that icons of one's own religious practices have meaningful symbolism, while another person's different religious practices do not.<ref name=janowitz239/><ref name=halbertal105/>
