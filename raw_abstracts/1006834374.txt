The Duchy of Prussia , or Ducal Prussia ; was a duchy in the Prussia (region) established as a result of secularization of the State of the Teutonic Order during the Protestant Reformation in 1525.
It was the first protestant state when Albert, Duke of Prussia formally adopted Lutheranism in 1525. It was inhabited by a German, Polish (mainly in Masuria), and Lithuanian-speaking (mainly in Lithuania Minor) population. In old texts, and in Latin, the term Prut(h)enia refers alike to Ducal Prussia, and the breakaway province of Royal Prussia, and their common predecessor, Teutonic Prussia. The adjectival form of the name was "Prut(h)enic".<ref> urltoken Notes and Queries, Oxford University Press, 1850</ref>
In 1525 during the Protestant Reformation, in accordance to the Treaty of Kraków, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Albert, secularized the order's Prussian territory, becoming Albert, Duke of Prussia. As the region had been an integral part of the Kingdom of Poland since the Second Peace of Thorn (1466),<ref></ref> King of Poland Sigismund I the Old, as its suzerain, granted the territory as a hereditary fief of Poland to Duke Albert per the Treaty of Kraków, a decision that was sealed by the Prussian Homage in Kraków in April 1525. The new duke established Lutheranism as the first protestant state church. The capital remained in Königsberg , , modern Kaliningrad). The duchy was inherited by the Hohenzollern prince-electors of Brandenburg in 1618. This personal union is referred to as Brandenburg-Prussia. Frederick William, the "Great Elector" of Brandenburg, achieved full sovereignty over the duchy under the 1657 Treaty of Wehlau, confirmed in the 1660 Treaty of Oliva. In the following years, attempts were made to return to Polish suzerainty, especially by the capital city of Königsberg, whose burghers rejected the treaties and viewed the region as part of Poland”.<ref name=JJ/><ref> urltoken The Duchy of Prussia was elevated to a kingdom in 1701.
