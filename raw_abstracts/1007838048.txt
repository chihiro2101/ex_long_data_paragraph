</ref> whereas micromolar concentrations of tetrodotoxin are required to inhibit TTX-r Na<sup>+</sup> channels.<ref></ref> Nerve cells containing TTX-r Na<sup>+</sup> channels are located primarily in cardiac tissue, while nerve cells containing TTX-s Na<sup>+</sup> channels dominate the rest of the body.
TTX and its analogs have historically been important agents for use as chemical tool compounds, for use in channel characterization and in fundamental studies of channel function.<ref name="Kao66" /><ref></ref> The prevalence of TTX-s Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the central nervous system makes tetrodotoxin a valuable agent for the silencing of neurons within a cell culture.
