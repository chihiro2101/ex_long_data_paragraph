I Remember Mama is a 1948 American drama film directed by George Stevens from a screenplay by DeWitt Bodeen, whose work was adapted from John Van Druten's stage play. Druten, in turn, had based his play on Kathryn Forbes' novel Mama's Bank Account, which was originally published by Harcourt Brace in 1943. The story in all its variant forms recounts the everyday life and economic struggles of a Norwegian immigrant family in San Francisco in the early 20th century. The film stars Irene Dunne in the titular role, as well as Barbara Bel Geddes, Oscar Homolka, Ellen Corby and Philip Dorn. Homolka portrays Uncle Chris in the film, a role he had performed earlier in the Broadway production.
The film was nominated for five Academy Awards.<ref>Dirks, Tim. urltoken "Filmsite Movie Review: I Remember Mama (1948)". AMC Filmsite, American Movie Classics Company, New York, N.Y. Retrieved July 4, 2017.</ref>
