A focus group is a group interview involving a small number of demographically similar people. Their reactions to specific researcher-posed questions are studied. Focus groups are used in market research and studies of people's political views. The discussions can be guided or open. They can concern a new product or something else. The idea is for the researcher to learn about the participants' reactions. If group members are representative of a larger population, those reactions can be expected to reflect the views of that larger population.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> Thus focus groups constitute a research method that researchers organize for the purpose of collecting qualitative data, through interactive and directed discussions.<ref name=":33"></ref>
A focus group is also a technique used by sociologists, psychologists, and researchers in communication studies, education, political science, and public health.<ref name=":3"></ref> Marketers can use the information collected from focus groups to obtain insights on a specific product, controversy, or topic.<ref name=":2"></ref> Used in qualitative research, the interviews involve a group of people who are asked about their perceptions, attitudes, opinions, beliefs, and views regarding many different topics (e.g., from abortion to political views to commercial products or services). Group members are often free to talk and interact with each other. Instead of a researcher individually asking group members questions, focus groups use group interaction to explore and clarify the beliefs, opinions, and views of participants. The interactivity of focus groups allows researchers to obtain qualitative data from multiple participants, often making focus groups a relatively quick and convenient research method.<ref></ref> While the focus group is taking place, the researcher either takes notes and/or records the discussion for later note-taking in order to learn from the group. Researchers should select members of the focus group carefully in order to obtain useful information.
