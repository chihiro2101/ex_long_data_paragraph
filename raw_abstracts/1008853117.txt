They are found only in eastern and central North America, where they grow in moist to dry prairies and open wooded areas. They have large, showy heads of composite flowers, blooming in summer. The generic name is derived from the Greek word , meaning "sea urchin", due to the spiny central disk. These flowering plants and their parts have different uses. Some species are cultivated in gardens for their showy flowers. Echinacea purpurea is used in traditional medicine.<ref name=NIH-NCCIH /> Two of the species, E. tennesseensis and E. laevigata, are listed in the United States as endangered species.<ref name="Conservation status of Echinacea"></ref>
