A Taser (also spelled tazer) is a non-lethal electroshock weapon used to incapacitate targets via shocks that temporarily impair the target's physical function to a level that allows them to be approached and handled in an unresisting and thus safe manner. It is sold by Axon, formerly TASER International.<ref> urltoken TASER X26 </ref> It fires two small barbed darts intended to puncture the skin and remain attached to the target, at 180 feet (55 m) per second. Their range extends from 15 feet (4.57 m) for non-Law Enforcement Tasers to 35 feet (10.67 m) for LE Tasers. The darts are connected to the main unit by thin insulated copper wire and deliver a modulated electric current designed to disrupt voluntary control of muscles, causing "neuromuscular incapacitation", which is often mistaken for unconsciousness by police officers and bystanders. The effects of a Taser device may only be localized pain or strong involuntary long muscle contractions, based on the mode of use and connectivity of the darts.<ref> urltoken "Neuromuscular Incapacitation (NMI)", TASER International, published March 12, 2007.

The Taser device is marketed as less-lethal, since the Taser safety issues whenever the weapon is deployed.<ref name="CEW"></ref> At least 49 people died in 2018 after being shocked by police with a Taser.
The first Taser conducted energy weapon was introduced in 1993<ref name="Axon Leadership Axon"></ref> Â 
The TASER 7 device is the newest of all three CEWs. It is a two-shot device with spiral darts that spool from the dart allowing the probes to fly straighter. The TASER 7 device's rapid arc technology with adaptive cross connections allows for full incapacitation. The TASER 7 CEW connects wirelessly to the Axon network of software that includes inventory management capabilities using Axon Evidence.<ref name="Taser 7 OG TItle Axon"/>
