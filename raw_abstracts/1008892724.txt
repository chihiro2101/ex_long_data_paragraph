King and 88 other boycott leaders and carpool drivers were indicted<ref></ref> for conspiring to interfere with a business under a 1921 ordinance.<ref></ref> Rather than wait to be arrested, they turned themselves in as an act of defiance.
King was ordered to pay a $500 fine or serve 386 days in jail. He ended up spending two weeks in jail. The move backfired by bringing national attention to the protest. King commented on the arrest by saying: "I was proud of my crime. It was the crime of joining my people in a nonviolent protest against injustice."<ref></ref>
