In geometry, the nine-point circle is a circle that can be constructed for any given triangle. It is so named because it passes through nine significant concyclic points defined from the triangle. These nine points are:
* The midpoint of each side of the triangle
* The foot of each altitude
* The midpoint of the line segment from each vertex of the triangle to the orthocenter (where the three altitudes meet; these line segments lie on their respective altitudes).<ref></ref><ref></ref>
The nine-point circle is also known as Feuerbach's circle, Euler's circle, Terquem's circle, the six-points circle, the twelve-points circle, the n-point circle, the medioscribed circle, the mid circle or the circum-midcircle. Its center is the nine-point center of the triangle.<ref> Kocik and Solecki (sharers of a 2010 Lester R. Ford Award) give a proof of the Nine-Point Circle Theorem.</ref><ref></ref>
