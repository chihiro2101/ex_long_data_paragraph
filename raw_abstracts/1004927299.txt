"To Autumn" is a poem by English Romantic poet John Keats (31 October 1795 â€“ 23 February 1821). The work was composed on 19 September 1819 and published in 1820 in a volume of Keats's poetry that included Lamia and The Eve of St. Agnes. "To Autumn" is the final work in a group of poems known as Keats's "1819 odes". Although personal problems left him little time to devote to poetry in 1819, he composed "To Autumn" after a walk near Winchester one autumnal evening. The work marks the end of his poetic career, as he needed to earn money and could no longer devote himself to the lifestyle of a poet. A little over a year after the publication of "To Autumn", Keats died in Rome.
The poem has three eleven-line stanzas which describe a progression through the season, from the late maturation of the crops to the harvest and to the last days of autumn when winter is nearing. The imagery is richly achieved through the personification of Autumn, and the description of its bounty, its sights and sounds. It has parallels in the work of English landscape artists,<ref name="Bewell 1999 p. 176">Bewell 1999 p. 176</ref> with Keats himself describing the fields of stubble that he saw on his walk as conveying the warmth of "some pictures".<ref name="Bate 1963 p. 580">Bate 1963 p. 580</ref>
The work has been interpreted as a meditation on death; as an allegory of artistic creation; as Keats's response to the Peterloo Massacre, which took place in the same year; and as an expression of nationalism sentiment. One of the most anthology English lyric poems, "To Autumn" has been regarded by critics as one of the most perfect short poems in the English language.
