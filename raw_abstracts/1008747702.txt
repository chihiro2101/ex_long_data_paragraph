Leytonstone High Road is a separate London Overground railway station, some 10 mins walk from the tube station, serving the line known colloquially as the GoBlin (Gospel Oak to Barking). In 2017–2018, the line was electrified ready for new longer trains with an additional 30 per cent capacity. After engineering and supply delays, these were finally introduced in June 2019.<ref></ref>
