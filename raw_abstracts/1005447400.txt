An appendectomy, also termed appendicectomy, is a Surgery in which the vermiform appendix (a portion of the intestine) is removed. Appendectomy is normally performed as an urgent or emergency procedure to treat complicated acute appendicitis.<ref name=":3"></ref>
Appendectomy may be performed laparoscopically (as minimally invasive surgery) or as an open operation.<ref name=":0" /> Over the 2010s, surgical practice has increasingly moved towards routinely offering laparoscopic appendicectomy; for example in the United Kingdom over 95% of adult appendicectomies are planned as laparoscopic procedures.<ref></ref> Laparoscopy is often used if the diagnosis is in doubt, or in order to leave a less visible surgical scar. Recovery may be slightly faster after laparoscopic surgery, although the laparoscopic procedure itself is more expensive and resource-intensive than open surgery and generally takes longer. Advanced pelvic sepsis occasionally requires a lower midline laparotomy.
Both uncomplicated (non-perforated) and complicated (perforated) appendicitis should undergo prompt surgical intervention.<ref name=":3" /> The difference in treatment occurs post-operatively with respect to the length of time the antibiotics are administered. For uncomplicated appendicitis, antibiotics should be continued up to 24 hours post-operatively. For complicated appendicitis, antibiotics should be continued for anywhere between 3 and 7 days.<ref name=":3" /> An interval appendectomy is generally performed 6-8 weeks after conservative management with antibiotics for special cases, such as perforated appendicitis.<ref> urltoken Sell N, O'Donnell T, Saillant N.
