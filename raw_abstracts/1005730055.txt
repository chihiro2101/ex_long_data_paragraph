A tweeter or treble speaker is a special type of loudspeaker (usually dome, inverse dome or horn-type) that is designed to produce high audio frequencies, typically from around 2&nbsp;kHz to 20&nbsp;kHz (generally considered to be the upper limit of human hearing). Specialty tweeters can deliver high frequencies up to 100&nbsp;kHz. The name is derived from the high pitched sounds made by some birds (Tweets), especially in contrast to the low woofs made by many dogs, after which low-frequency drivers are named (woofers).
