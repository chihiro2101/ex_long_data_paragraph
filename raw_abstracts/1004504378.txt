U.S. Route 61 or U.S. Highway 61 (US&nbsp;61) is a major United States highway that extends between New Orleans, Louisiana and the city of Wyoming, Minnesota. The highway generally follows the course of the Mississippi River and is designated the Great River Road for much of its route. As of 2004, the highway's northern terminus in Wyoming, Minnesota, is at an intersection with Interstate 35 (I-35). Until 1991, the highway extended north on what is now Minnesota State Highway 61 (MN 61) through Duluth to the Canada–U.S. border near Grand Portage. Its southern terminus in New Orleans is at an intersection with U.S. Route 90 (US 90). The route was an important south–north connection in the days before the interstate highway system. 
The highway is often called the Blues Highway because of its long history with the Blues genre. It is the supposed location where singer-songwriter Robert Johnson made a deal with the Devil for his successes. Other notable songs named for the highway include a blues song recorded in 1957 by Sunnyland Slim; one in 1962 by Johnny Young; and a 1981 song, "61 Highway", by bluesman James "Son" Thomas. To denote US 61's significance in Blues history, there are two markers on the route which are part of the Mississippi Blues Trail: 61 Highway in Vicksburg, Mississippi and Highway 61 Blues in Tunica, Mississippi.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The road later gave its name to Minnesota native Bob Dylan's album Highway 61 Revisited and to the song of the same name, which imagines all sorts of fantastical events (including World War III) occurring alongside it.
