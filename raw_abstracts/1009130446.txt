This shows a structure typical for English-speaking cultures (and some others). Other cultures use other structures for full names
A given name (also known as a first name or forename) is the part of a personal name<ref name="grigg-1991"> quoted in </ref> that identifies a person, potentially with a middle name as well, and differentiates that person from the other members of a group (typically a family or clan) who have a common surname. The term given name refers to a name bestowed at or close to the time of birth, usually by the parents of the newborn. A Christian name is the first name which is given at baptism, in Christian custom.
In informal situations, given names are often used in a familiar and friendly manner.<ref name="grigg-1991" /> In more formal situations, a person's surname is more commonly used—unless a distinction needs to be made between people with the same surname. The idioms 'on a first-name basis' and 'being on first-name terms' refer to the familiarity inherent in addressing someone by their given name.<ref name="grigg-1991" />
By contrast, a surname (also known as a family name, last name, or gentile name) is normally inherited and shared with other members of one's immediate family.<ref>"A name given to a person at birth or at baptism, as distinguished from a surname" – according to the urltoken American Heritage Dictionary </ref> Regnal names and Religious name are special given names bestowed upon someone receiving a crown or entering a religious order; such a person then typically becomes known chiefly by that name.
