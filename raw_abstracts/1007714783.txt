and the prairie falcon (F.&nbsp;mexicanus). This lineage probably diverged from other falcons towards the end of the Late Miocene or in the Early Pliocene, about 5–8&nbsp;million years ago (mya). As the peregrine-hierofalcon group includes both Old World and North American species, it is likely that the lineage originated in western Eurasia or Africa. Its relationship to other falcons is not clear, as the issue is complicated by widespread hybridization confounding mtDNA sequence analyses. For example, a genetic lineage of the saker falcon (F.&nbsp;cherrug) is known<ref name=Helbig1994/><ref name=Wink1998/> which originated from a male saker producing fertile young with a female peregrine ancestor, and the descendants further breeding with sakers.<ref name=Seibold1993/>
Today, peregrines are regularly paired in captivity with other species such as the lanner falcon (F.&nbsp;biarmicus) to produce the "perilanner", a somewhat popular bird in falconry as it combines the peregrine's hunting skill with the lanner's hardiness, or the gyrfalcon to produce large, strikingly coloured birds for the use of falconers. As can be seen, the peregrine is still genetically close to the hierofalcons, though their lineages diverged in the Late Pliocene (maybe some 2.5–2&nbsp;mya in the Gelasian).<ref name=Nittinger2005/><ref name=Helbig1994/><ref name=Wink1998/><ref name=Griffiths1999/><ref name=Wink2000/><ref name=Groombridge2002/><ref name=Griffiths2004/>
