Jai alai : is a sport involving a ball that is bounced off a walled space by accelerating it to high speeds with a hand-held wicker device (cesta). It is a variation of Basque pelota. The term, coined by Serafin Baroja in 1875, is also often loosely applied to the fronton (the open-walled playing area) where the sport is played. The game, whose name means "merry festival" in Basque, is called "zesta-punta" (basket tip) in the Basque Country. The sport is played in Spain, south west of France and Latin American countries.
