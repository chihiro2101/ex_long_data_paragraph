The Holodeck is a fictional device from the television franchise Star Trek. It is a stage where participants may engage with different virtual reality environments. From a storytelling point of view, it permits the introduction of a wide variety of locations and characters, such as events and persons in the Earth's past and imaginary places or beings, that would otherwise require complicated set-ups such as time-travel or dream sequences. Writers often use it as a way to pose philosophical questions.
In the series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, the device is referred to as a holosuite. Quark maintains several of them in his bar aboard the titular station and rents them out to customers.
Although the Holodeck is supposed to be a safe alternative to reality, many Star Trek shows feature holodeck-gone-bad plots in which real-world dangers become part of what is supposed to be a controlled environment.<ref>Thomas Richards, The Meaning of Star Trek.
