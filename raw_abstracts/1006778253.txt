The canal network of the United Kingdom played a vital role in the Industrial Revolution. The canals permitted the creation of wealth, by industry, that led to the British Empire in the Victorian Era. The UK was the first country to develop a nationwide canal network, which expanded to nearly 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometres) in length. The canals allowed raw materials to be transported to a place of manufacture, and finished goods to be transported to consumers, more quickly and cheaply than via a land based route.
In the post-medieval period, some rivers were canalised for boat traffic. The Exeter Ship Canal was completed in 1567. The Sankey Canal was the first British canal of the Industrial Revolution, opening in 1757. The Bridgewater Canal followed in 1761 and proved to be highly profitable. A "Golden Age" of canals occurred between the 1770s and 1830s, during which the majority of the network was built. From 1840 the canals began to decline, because the growing railway network was a more efficient means of transporting goods. From the beginning of the 20th century the road network became progressively more important, canals became uneconomic and were abandoned. Consequently, in 1948, much of the network was nationalised. Since the second half of the 20th century there has been a growing use of the canals for recreation and tourism. 
Different types of boat used the canals, the most common being the traditional narrowboat, that were painted in the Roses and Castles design. At the outset the boats were towed by horses and later they were driven by diesel engines. Restoration projects take place to restore closed canals and canal museums have opened. The network built was extensive and included feats of civil engineering such as the Anderton Boat Lift, the Manchester Ship Canal, the Worsley Navigable Levels and the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct.
