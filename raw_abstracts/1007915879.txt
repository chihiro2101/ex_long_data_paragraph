The Khanate of Sibir , also historically called the Khanate of Turan,<ref>John Smith, A System of Modern Geography: Or, the Natural and Political History of the Present State of the World vol.1 p.321.</ref><ref>Tooke, William, A View of the Russian empire during the reign of Catharine the Second volume II p.60</ref> was a Turkic Khanate, located in southwestern Siberia and with a Turco-Mongol ruling class. Throughout its history, members of the Shiban and Taibuga dynasties often contested the rulership over the Khanate between each other; both of these competing tribes were direct patrilineal descendants of Genghis Khan through his eldest son Jochi and Jochi's fifth son Shiban (died 1266). The area of the Khanate had once formed an integral part of the Mongol Empire, and later came under the control of the White Horde and of the Golden Horde of 1242-1502.
The Khanate of Sibir had an ethnically diverse population of Turkic Siberian Tatars, Bashkirs and speakers of various Uralic languages - including the Khanty, Mansi and Selkup. The Sibir Khanate was the northernmost Muslim state in recorded history. 
Its defeat by Yermak Timofeyevich in 1582 marked the beginning of the Russian conquest of Siberia.
