The second stage of the redevelopment of the Southwark building, during which the museum remained open to the public, was completed in 1994.<ref name=arupjournal/> During the 1990s, while these works were going on, the museum was also seeking to open a branch in the north of England. 71 sites were offered for consideration by 36 local councils and in January 1999 the then Culture Secretary Chris Smith formally launched a project to construct a new branch of the museum, Imperial War Museum North, in Trafford, Greater Manchester.<ref name=Glancey>Glancey, Jonathan (22 April 2002) The Guardian urltoken War and peace and quiet.

The following year, 2000, the final phase of the Southwark redevelopment was completed. The development included the installation of the museum's Holocaust Exhibition which was opened by the Queen on 6 June 2000. This was the first permanent exhibition dedicated to the Holocaust in a UK museum; its development had taken five years at a cost of £5&nbsp;million.<ref>For details of the development process of the Holocaust Exhibition see .</ref> Two years later, in July 2002, Imperial War Museum North was opened.
Between 2004 and 2010 the museum was a partner in a national learning project entitled "Their Past Your Future" (TPYF), part of the Big Lottery Fund's Veterans Reunited programme to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.<ref name="VeteransEval"></ref> A partnership between the IWM, the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, and Scottish, Northern Irish and Welsh museum authorities, phase one included a touring exhibition seen by more than two million people,<ref></ref> overseas educational visits<ref></ref> and further activities run by local authorities.
