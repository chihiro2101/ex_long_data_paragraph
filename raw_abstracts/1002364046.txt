Guibert de Nogent (c. 1055–1124) was a Benedictine historian, theology and author of autobiography memoirs. Guibert was relatively unknown in his own time, going virtually unmentioned by his contemporaries. He has only recently caught the attention of scholars who have been more interested in his extensive autobiographical memoirs and personality which provide insight into medieval life.
