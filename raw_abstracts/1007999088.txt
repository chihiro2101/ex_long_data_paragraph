John "Jack" Gilbert Graham (January 23, 1932 â€“ January 11, 1957) was an American mass murderer who, on November 1, 1955, killed 44 people aboard United Airlines Flight 629 near Longmont, Colorado, using a dynamite time bomb. Graham planted the bomb in his mother's suitcase in an apparent move to murder her and claim $37,500 worth of life insurance money from policies he purchased in the airport terminal just before the flight departure. Graham was charged with and convicted of the murder of his mother. He was sentenced to death and was executed by the state of Colorado in January 1957.
