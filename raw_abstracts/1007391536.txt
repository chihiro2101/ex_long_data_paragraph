Price discrimination is a microeconomic pricing strategy where identical or largely similar goods or services are sold at different prices by the same provider in different markets.<ref name="krugman-a"></ref><ref name="Phillips2005-74"></ref><ref name="BelobabaOdoni2009"></ref> Price discrimination is distinguished from product differentiation by the more substantial difference in production cost for the differently priced products involved in the latter strategy.<ref name="BelobabaOdoni2009"/> Price differentiation essentially relies on the variation in the customers' willingness to pay<ref name="Phillips2005-74"/><ref name="BelobabaOdoni2009"/><ref name="auto">Apollo, M.

For price discrimination to succeed, a firm must have market power, such as a dominant market share, product uniqueness, sole pricing power, etc.<ref></ref> All prices under price discrimination are higher than the equilibrium price in a perfectly-competitive market. However, some prices under price discrimination may be lower than the price charged by a single-price monopolist.
The term differential pricing is also used to describe the practice of charging different prices to different buyers for the same quality and quantity of a product,<ref name="PrideFerrell2011"></ref> but it can also refer to a combination of price differentiation and product differentiation.<ref name="BelobabaOdoni2009"/> Other terms used to refer to price discrimination include equity pricing, preferential pricing,<ref name="Macklin2004"></ref> dual pricing<ref name="auto"/> and tiered pricing.<ref name="HoekmanMattoo2002"></ref> Within the broader domain of price differentiation, a commonly accepted classification dating to the 1920s is:<ref name="Shapiro1999-39"></ref><ref name="BelleflammePeitz2010-196"/>
* Personalized pricing (or first-degree price differentiation) — selling to each customer at a different price; this is also called one-to-one marketing.<ref name="Shapiro1999-39"/> The optimal incarnation of this is called perfect price discrimination and maximizes the price that each customer is willing to pay.<ref name="Shapiro1999-39"/> 
* Product versioning<ref name="Phillips2005-74"/><ref name="HayesMiller2011"/> or simply versioning (or second-degree price differentiation) — offering a product line<ref name="Shapiro1999-39"/> by creating slightly different products for the purpose of price differentiation,<ref name="Phillips2005-74"/><ref name="HayesMiller2011"></ref> i.e. a vertical product line.<ref name="Phillips2005-82"></ref> Another name given to versioning is menu pricing.<ref name="BelleflammePeitz2010-196"/><ref name="PepallRichards2011"></ref>
* Group pricing (or third-degree price differentiation) — dividing the market into segments and charging a different price to each segment (but the same price to each member of that segment).<ref name="Shapiro1999-39"/><ref name="Phillips2005-78"></ref> This is essentially a heuristic approximation that simplifies the problem in face of the difficulties with personalized pricing.<ref name="BelleflammePeitz2010-196"></ref><ref name="Phillips2005-77"></ref> Typical examples include student discounts<ref name="Phillips2005-78"/> and seniors' discounts.
