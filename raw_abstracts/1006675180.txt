Belvoir Castle <ref name="Collins"></ref>) is a historic castle and stately home in Leicestershire, England, situated 10 km west of the town of Grantham and 16 km north-east of Melton Mowbray. The Castle was first built immediately after the Norman Conquest of 1066 and has since been rebuilt at least three times, the surviving structure, a grade I listed building,<ref></ref> dating from the early 19th century. It is the seat of David Manners, 11th Duke of Rutland (the tiny county of Rutland lies 25 km south<ref>Based on position of Oakham, county town of Rutland</ref> of Belvoir Castle), whose direct male ancestor inherited it in 1508. His secondary seat is Haddon Hall in Derbyshire.<ref>Kidd, Charles, Debrett's Peerage & Baronetage 2015 Edition, London, 2015, p.1074</ref> The traditional burial place of the Manners family was in the parish church of St Mary the Virgin, Bottesford, situated 5 km to the north of the Castle, but since 1825 they have been buried in the ducal mausoleum built next to the Castle in that year, to which their ancient monuments were moved. It remains the private property of the Duke of Rutland but is open to the general public. 
The castle is situated at the extreme northerly corner of the county of Leicestershire and is sandwiched between Lincolnshire to the east and Nottinghamshire at west, and overlooks the Vale of Belvoir to the north-west<ref></ref> on the Nottinghamshire border. It is surrounded by the villages of Redmile, Woolsthorpe, Knipton, Harston, Harlaxton, Croxton Kerrial and Bottesford. The Antiquarian John Leland (d.1552) stated: "the Castle stands on the very nape of a high hill, steep up each way, partly by nature, partly by the working of men's hands."<ref>Quoted in Cantor 1977â€“1978 p. 35.</ref> The 15,000 acre (6,000 hectare)<ref></ref> Belvoir estate, situated in the heart of England's prime fox-hunting terrain,<ref>Perfectly suited to equestrian sport due to largely flat and cleared land with many hedges and small streams suited for jumping</ref> is the headquarters of the famous Belvoir Hunt ("the Duke of Rutland's Hounds"<ref> urltoken established in 1750 and now kennelled 1 km south-east of the Castle.
