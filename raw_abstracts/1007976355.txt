Tafl games (<small>pronounced</small> Help:IPA|tavl, also known as hnefatafl games) are a family of ancient Nordic and Celts strategy board games played on a checkered or latticed gameboard with two armies of uneven numbers. Most probably they are based upon the Roman game Ludus latrunculorum.
Names of different variants of Tafl include Hnefatafl, Tablut, Tawlbwrdd, Brandubh, Ard Rí, and Alea Evangelii. Games in the tafl family were played in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Britain, Ireland, and Sápmi.<ref>Murray 1951, p.&nbsp;56, Helmfrid 2005, p.&nbsp;2 Duggan 2015</ref> Tafl gaming was eventually supplanted by chess in the 12th&nbsp;Century,<ref name="Murray">Murray 1951, pp.&nbsp;56–57.</ref> but the tafl variant of the Sami people, tablut, was in play until at least the 1700s. The rules for tablut were written down by the Swedish naturalist Linnaeus in 1732, and these were translated from Latin to English in 1811. All modern tafl games are based on the 1811 translation, which had many errors. New rules were added to amend the issues resulting from these errors, leading to the creation of a modern family of tafl games. In addition, tablut is now also played in accordance with its original rules, which have been retranslated.<ref></ref>
