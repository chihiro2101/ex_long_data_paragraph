A castell is a human tower built traditionally at festivals in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community. 
At these festivals, several colles castelleres (teams that build towers) attempt to build and dismantle a tower's structure. On November 16, 2010, castells were declared by UNESCO to be amongst the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.<ref>BBC, urltoken Close-Up: Catalonia's human towers </ref>
