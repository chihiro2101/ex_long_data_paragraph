A protoplanetary disk is a rotating circumstellar disc of dense gas and dust surrounding a stellar evolution star, a T Tauri star, or Herbig Ae/Be star. The protoplanetary disk may also be considered an accretion disk for the star itself, because gases or other material may be falling from the inner edge of the disk onto the surface of the star. This process should not be confused with the accretion process thought to build up the planets themselves. Externally illuminated photo-evaporating protoplanetary disks are called proplyds.
In July 2018, the first confirmed image of such a disk, containing a nascent exoplanet, named PDS 70b, was reported.<ref name="EA-20180702"></ref><ref name="ESO-20180629"></ref><ref name="ESO-20180630"></ref>
