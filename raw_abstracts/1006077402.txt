Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by parasites of the Leishmania type.<ref name=WHO2014/> It is spread by the bite of certain types of sandflies, and occurs most frequently in the tropics and sub-tropics of Africa, Asia, the Americas, and southern Europe.<ref name=WHO2014/> The disease can present in three main ways: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, or visceral.<ref name=WHO2014></ref> The cutaneous form presents with skin ulcers, while the mucocutaneous form presents with ulcers of the skin, mouth, and nose. The visceral form starts with skin ulcers and later presents with fever, low count of red blood cells, and enlarged spleen and liver.<ref name=WHO2014/><ref name=Barrett2012/>
Infections in humans are caused by more than 20 species of Leishmania.<ref name="WHO2014" /> Risk factors include poverty, malnutrition, deforestation, and urbanization.<ref name="WHO2014" /> All three types can be diagnosed by seeing the parasites under microscopy.<ref name="WHO2014" /> Additionally, visceral disease can be diagnosed by blood tests.<ref name="Barrett2012" />
Leishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide.<ref name=WHO2014/> Other measures include spraying insecticides to kill sandflies and treating people with the disease early to prevent further spread.<ref name=WHO2014/> The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of Leishmania, and the type of infection.<ref name=WHO2014/> Some possible medications used for visceral disease include liposomal amphotericin B,<ref name=Sun2013/> a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin,<ref name=Sun2013></ref> and miltefosine.<ref name=Dor2012></ref> For cutaneous disease, paromomycin, fluconazole, or pentamidine may be effective.<ref name=Min2007></ref>
About 4 to 12 million people are currently infected<ref name=Mag></ref><ref name=GBD2015Pre></ref> in some 98 countries.<ref name=Barrett2012></ref> About 2 million new cases<ref name=Barrett2012/> and between 20 and 50 thousand deaths occur each year.<ref name=WHO2014/><ref name=Loz2012></ref> About 200&nbsp;million people in Asia, Africa, South and Central America, and southern Europe live in areas where the disease is common.<ref name=Barrett2012/><ref></ref> The World Health Organization has obtained discounts on some medications to treat the disease.<ref name=Barrett2012/> It is classified as a neglected tropical disease.<ref name=NTD2017></ref> The disease may occur in a number of other animals, including dogs and rodents.<ref name=WHO2014/>
