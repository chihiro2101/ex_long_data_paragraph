The 24-hour clock, popularly referred to in the United States and some other countries as military time,<ref name="CLDR" /><ref>U.S. Government Printing Office, Style Manual. </ref> is the convention of timekeeping in which the day runs from midnight to midnight and is divided into 24 hours.

A number of countries, particularly English-speaking, use the 12-hour clock, or a mixture of the 24- and 12-hour time systems. In countries where the 12-hour clock is dominant, some professions prefer to use the 24-hour clock. For example, in the practice of medicine, the 24-hour clock is generally used in documentation of care as it prevents any ambiguity as to when events occurred in a patient's medical history.<ref></ref>
