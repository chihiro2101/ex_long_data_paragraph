The Mentors are an American heavy metal band, known for their deliberate shock rock lyrics.
Originally formed in Seattle, Washington in May 1976,<ref name=bio></ref> they relocated to Los Angeles, California in 1979. 
The band garnered attention both from noted hard rock acts and pro-censorship movements such as the Parents Music Resource Center,<ref name=allmusic></ref> but the death of drummer and lead singer Eldon Hoke ("El Duce") in 1997 brought them unprecedented attention. The band remains active today with a different line-up: Sickie Wifebeater (Steve Carlson) on lead guitar, Dr Heathen Scum (Steve Broy) on bass guitar, Cousin Fister (Bryan) on rhythm guitar, and John Christopher on drums.
