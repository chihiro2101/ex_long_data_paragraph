Print on demand (POD) is a printing technology and business process in which book copies (or other documents) are not printed until the company receives an order, allowing prints of single or small quantities. While other industries established the build to order business model, "print on demand" could only develop after the beginning of digital printing,<ref> part of the Encyclopedia of Printing Technologies in 2 volumes.</ref> because it was not economical to print single copies using traditional printing technology such as letterpress and offset printing.
Many traditional small presses have replaced their traditional printing equipment with POD equipment or contract their printing to POD service providers. Many academic publishing, including university presses, use POD services to maintain large backlists (lists of older publications); some use POD for all of their publications.<ref></ref> Larger publishers may use POD in special circumstances, such as reprinting older, out-of-print titles, or for test marketing.<ref name="snowbooktech">
