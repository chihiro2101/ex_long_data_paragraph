In term logic (a branch of philosophical logic), the square of opposition is a diagram representing the relations between the four basic categorical propositions.
The origin of the square can be traced back to Aristotle making the distinction between two oppositions: contradiction and contrariety.
However, Aristotle did not draw any diagram. This was done several centuries later by Apuleius and Boethius.
