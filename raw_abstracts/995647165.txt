Amenorrhea is the absence of a menstrual cycle in a woman of reproductive age.<ref></ref> Physiological states of amenorrhoea are seen, most commonly, during pregnancy and lactation (breastfeeding), the latter also forming the basis of a form of contraception known as the lactational amenorrhea method. Outside the reproductive years, there is absence of menses during childhood and after menopause.
Amenorrhoea is a symptom with many potential causes.<ref></ref>
Primary amenorrhoea is defined as an absence of secondary sex characteristic by age 14 with no menarche or normal secondary sexual characteristics but no menarche by 16 years of age. It may be caused by developmental problems, such as the congenital absence of the uterus, failure of the ovary to receive or maintain egg cells, or delay in pubertal development.<ref></ref>
Secondary amenorrhoea (menstrual cycles ceasing) is often caused by hormonal disturbances from the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, from premature menopause or intrauterine scar formation. It is defined as the absence of menses for three months in a woman with previously normal menstruation, or six months for women with a history of oligomenorrhea.<ref></ref>
