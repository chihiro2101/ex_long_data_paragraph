Cabramatta is a suburb in South-Western Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Cabramatta is located south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Fairfield.
Cabramatta is colloquially known as 'Cabra' and has the largest Vietnamese community in Australia. It is also Australia's largest non-Anglo-Celtic commercial precinct. The population demographics are reflected by the many Vietnamese-Australian businesses. As a result, the suburb is considered a Gourmand for Vietnamese, Thai, Cambodian and Chinese cuisines.
Cabramatta used to have a longstanding image problem, primarily due to its reputation as a point for drug-dealing. These drug activities began from the early 1990s (to late) as drug addicts were drawn to the area.<ref></ref> However, since 2002, the problems have receded after an anti-drug crackdown was enforced by the NSW State Parliament.<ref></ref>
