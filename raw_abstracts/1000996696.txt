In algebraic geometry, a Calabi&ndash;Yau manifold, also known as a Calabi&ndash;Yau space, is a particular type of manifold which has properties, such as Ricci flatness, yielding applications in theoretical physics. Particularly in superstring theory, the extra dimensions of spacetime are sometimes conjectured to take the form of a 6-dimensional Calabi&ndash;Yau manifold, which led to the idea of mirror symmetry. Their name was coined by , after who first conjectured that such surfaces might exist, and who proved the Calabi conjecture.
Calabi&ndash;Yau manifolds are complex manifolds that are generalizations of K3 surfaces in any number of complex dimensions (i.e. any even number of real dimensions). They were originally defined as compact KÃ¤hler manifolds with a vanishing first Chern class and a Ricci-flat metric, though many other similar but inequivalent definitions are sometimes used.
