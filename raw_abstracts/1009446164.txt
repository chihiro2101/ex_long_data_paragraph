Grace Communion International (GCI), formerly the Worldwide Church of God (WCG) (still registered as Worldwide Church of God in the UK and some other regions) and the Radio Church of God, is a Christian denomination based in Charlotte, North Carolina, US, with the former mentioned organizations having had an often controversial influence on 20th-century religious broadcasting and publishing in the United States and Europe.
Originally based in Eugene, Oregon, and formerly named The Radio Church of God, its parent WCG organization was founded in 1934 by televangelist Herbert W. Armstrong as a radio ministry<ref></ref> that promoted a strict, minimalist doctrine. Armstrong prophesied that the world might end in 1975, observed a Saturday Sabbath,<ref></ref> forbade medical interventions,<ref name=Prytz/> and often required three tithes.<ref></ref><ref name=history></ref> The radio ministry initially spread Armstrong's prophecies and interpretations of the Bible via its national radio broadcast, The World Tomorrow, which later became a television program as well. After a few years on the air, Armstrong had developed a small following, so the church started publishing a free magazine, The Plain Truth, to supplement Armstrong's message in print for its radio audience.<ref name=Tucker/> In 1947, the church relocated its headquarters to Ambassador College in Pasadena, California, also founded by Armstrong, and in 1968, the movement was renamed the Worldwide Church of God (WCG).<ref name=Tucker></ref> Under its WCG incarnation, the church developed a reputation as a "doomsday cult".<ref name=Prytz></ref>
Within a few years of Armstrong's death in 1986, Joseph W. Tkach, Armstrong's chosen successor, along with other leading ministers came to the conclusion that a great many of their doctrines were not biblical. As a result, many members and ministers left and formed other churches that conformed to many of the teachings of Armstrong. In 2009, the church changed its name from The Worldwide Church of God to its current name.<ref name=namechange></ref> The GCI is a member of the National Association of Evangelicals, and has 50,000 members in 900 congregations in about 100 countries.<ref name="NAE"></ref>
