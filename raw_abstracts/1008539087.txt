VxWorks is a real-time operating system (RTOS) developed as proprietary software by Wind River Systems, a wholly owned subsidiary of TPG Capital, US. First released in 1987, VxWorks is designed for use in embedded systems requiring real-time, deterministic performance and, in many cases, safety and security certification, for industries, such as aerospace and defense, medical devices, industrial equipment, robotics, energy, transportation, network infrastructure, automotive, and consumer electronics.<ref name="64bitWBvert">" urltoken VxWorks Goes 64-bit", Electronic Design, March 25, 2011</ref>

VxWorks comes with the kernel, middleware, board support packages, Wind River Workbench development suite and complementary third-party software and hardware technologies. In its latest release, VxWorks 7, the RTOS has been re-engineered for modularity and upgradeability so the OS kernel is separate from middleware, applications and other packages.<ref name="iTERS"> urltoken Wind River reinvents real-time system for the Internet of Things, iTERS news, March 2014</ref> Scalability, security, safety, connectivity, and graphics have been improved to address Internet of Things (IoT) needs.<ref name="MSSC"></ref><ref name="msscwb">Wind River urltoken Reinvents the RTOS for the IoT, Business Wire, February 2014</ref><ref name="joab1"></ref>
