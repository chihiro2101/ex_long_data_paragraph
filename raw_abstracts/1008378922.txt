Frederick Griffith (1877â€“1941) was a British bacteriologist whose focus was the epidemiology and pathology of bacterial pneumonia. In January 1928 he reported what is now known as Griffith's experiment, the first widely accepted demonstrations of bacterial transformation, whereby a bacterium distinctly changes its form and function.<ref name = Griffith></ref>
 
He showed that Streptococcus pneumoniae, implicated in many cases of lobar pneumonia,<ref name="pmid21576901"></ref> could transform from one strain into a different strain. The observation was attributed to an unidentified transforming principle or transforming factor.<ref name = Griffith/> This was later identified as DNA.<ref name="isbn0-89766-905-3"></ref>
America's leading pneumococcal researcher, Oswald T. Avery, speculated that Griffith had failed to apply adequate controls.<ref name=pmid4143929></ref> A cautious and thorough researcher, and a reticent individual, Griffith's tendency was to publish only findings that he believed truly significant, and Griffith's findings were rapidly confirmed by researchers in Avery's laboratory.<ref name=pmid4143929/> His discovery was one of the first to show the central role of DNA in heredity.<ref name="isbn0-89766-905-3"/>
