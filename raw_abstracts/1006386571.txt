A crime against peace, in international law, is "planning, preparation, initiation, or waging of War of aggression, or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances, or participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing".<ref name="black book">Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, Stéphane Courtois, The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression, Harvard University Press, 1999, hardcover, 858 pages, , page 5.</ref> This definition of crimes against peace was first incorporated into the Nuremberg Principles and later included in the United Nations Charter. This definition would play a part in defining Aggression (war crime). It can also refer to the core international crimes set out in Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression), which adopted crimes negotiated previously in the Draft code of crimes against the peace and security of mankind.
An important exception to the foregoing are defensive military actions taken under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Such defensive actions are subject to immediate Security Council review, but do not require UN permission to be legal within international law. "Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations." (UN Charter, Article 51) The Security Council will determine if the action is legally the "right of individual or collective self-defence", or it may appoint another UN organ to do this.
Examples of crimes against peace include Second Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935,<ref></ref> Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Stalin and Hitler on the partition of Poland and annexation of Baltic States, Winter War in 1939, German-occupied Europe during World War II, the invasion of South Korea by North Korea in 1950, and the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in 1990.<ref name="black book"/>
