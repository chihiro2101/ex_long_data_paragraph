A milkshake, or simply shake, is a drink that is traditionally made by blending cow's milk, ice cream, and flavorings or sweeteners such as butterscotch, caramel sauce, chocolate syrup, fruit syrup, or whole fruit into a thick, sweet, cold mixture. It may also be made using other types of milk such as almond milk, coconut milk, or soy milk.
Milkshakes originated in the United States around the turn of the 20th century, and grew in popularity following the introduction of electric blenders in the following two decades. They became a common part of youth popular culture, as ice cream shops were a culturally acceptable meeting place for youth, and milkshakes became symbolic of the innocence of youth. In more recent years, the use of milkshakes in protest incidents has lead to the phenomenon of milkshaking.
