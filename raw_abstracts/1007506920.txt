Shaw Brothers (HK) Ltd. is the largest film production company of Hong Kong that operated from 1925 to 2011.
In 1925, three Shaw brothers&mdash;Runje, Runme, and Runde&mdash;founded Tianyi Film Company (also called "Unique") in Shanghai, and established a film distribution base in Singapore, where Runme and their youngest brother, Run Run Shaw, managed the precursor to the parent company, Shaw Organisation. Runme and Run Run took over the film production business of its Hong Kong-based sister company, Shaw & Sons Ltd., and in 1958, a new company, "Shaw Brothers," was set up. In the 1960s, Shaw Brothers established what was once the largest privately owned studio in the world, Movietown.
Over the years the film company produced some 1,000 films, some becoming the most popular and significant Chinese-language films of the period. It also popularized the Kung fu film of films. In 1987, the company suspended film production in order to concentrate on the television industry through its subsidiary TVB. Film production resumed in limited capacity in 2009.
In 2011 Shaw Brothers was reorganized into the Clear Water Bay Land Company Limited; its film production business was taken over by other companies within the Shaw conglomerate.
