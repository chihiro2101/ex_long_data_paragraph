A Domain Name System-based Blackhole List, Domain Name System Blacklist<ref></ref> (DNSBL) or Real-time Blackhole List (RBL) is a service whereby with a simple DNS query mail servers can check whether a sending IP address is on a blacklist of IP addresses reputed to send email spam. Most mail server software can be configured to check one or more of such lists - typically rejecting or flagging messages if it is from a listed site. 
A DNSBL is a software mechanism, rather than a specific list or policy. There are dozens of DNSBLs in existence,<ref></ref> which use a wide array of criteria for the listing and delisting of addresses. These may include listing the addresses of zombie computers or other machines being used to send spam, Internet service providers (ISPs) who willingly host spammers, or those which have sent spam to a honeypot system.
Since the creation of the first DNSBL in 1998, the operation and policies of these lists have frequently been controversial,<ref></ref><ref></ref> both in Internet advocacy circles and occasionally in lawsuits. Many email systems operators and users<ref></ref> consider DNSBLs a valuable tool to share information about sources of spam, but others including some prominent Internet activists have objected to them as a form of censorship.<ref></ref><ref name="EFF-Effector"></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> In addition, a small number of DNSBL operators have been the target of lawsuits filed by spammers seeking to have the lists shut down.<ref></ref>
