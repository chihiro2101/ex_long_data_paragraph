The Swabian Jura , more rarely: , sometimes also named Swabian Alps in English, is a mountain range in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany, extending from southwest to northeast and in width. It is named after the region of Swabia.
The Swabian Jura occupies the region bounded by the Danube in the southeast and the upper Neckar in the northwest. In the southwest it rises to the higher mountains of the Black Forest. The highest mountain of the region is the Lemberg . The area's profile resembles a high plateau, which slowly falls away to the southeast. The northwestern edge is a steep escarpment (called the Albtrauf or Albanstieg, rising up , covered with forests), while the top is flat or gently rolling.
In economic and cultural terms, the Swabian Jura includes regions just around the mountain range. It is a popular recreation area.
