Samuel Smiles (23 December 1812 â€“ 16 April 1904) was a Scottish author and government reformer. Although he campaigned on a Chartism platform, he promoted the idea that more progress would come from new attitudes than from new laws. His primary work, Self-Help (1859), promoted thrift and claimed that poverty was caused largely by irresponsible habits, while also attacking materialism and laissez-faire government. It has been called "the bible of mid-Victorian liberalism" and had lasting effects on British political thought.
