A supercell is a thunderstorm characterized by the presence of a mesocyclone: a deep, persistently rotating updraft.<ref></ref> For this reason, these storms are sometimes referred to as rotating thunderstorms.<ref> urltoken ON THE MESOCYCLONE "DRY INTRUSION" AND TORNADOGENESIS, Archived at: , Leslie R. Lemon</ref> Of the four classifications of thunderstorms (supercell, squall line, multi-cell, and pulse storm), supercells are the overall least common and have the potential to be the most severe. Supercells are often isolated from other thunderstorms, and can dominate the local weather up to away. They tend to last 2â€“4 hours.
Supercells are often put into three classification types: classic (Normal precipitation level), low-precipitation (LP), and high-precipitation (HP). LP supercells are usually found in climates that are more arid, such as the high plains of the United States, and HP supercells are most often found in moist climates. Supercells can occur anywhere in the world under the right pre-existing weather conditions, but they are most common in the Great Plains of the United States in an area known as Tornado Alley and in the Tornado Corridor of Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil.
