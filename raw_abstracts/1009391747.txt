Retrofuturism (adjective retrofuturistic or retrofuture) is a movement in the creative arts showing the influence of depictions of the future produced in an earlier era. If futurism is sometimes called a "science" bent on anticipating what will come, retrofuturism is the remembering of that anticipation.<ref>Elizabeth Guffey and Kate C. Lemay, "Retrofuturism and Steampunk", The Oxford Handbook to Science Fiction, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 434.</ref> Characterized by a blend of old-fashioned "retro styles" with futuristic technology, retrofuturism explores the themes of tension between past and future, and between the alienating and empowering effects of technology. Primarily reflected in artistic creations and modified technologies that realize the imagined artifacts of its parallel reality, retrofuturism can be seen as "an animating perspective on the world".<ref>Robert Lanham, "Introduction", The Oxford Handbook to Science Fiction, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 14</ref>
