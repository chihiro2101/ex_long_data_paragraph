Herzog explained how the choir-like sound was created, "We used a strange instrument, which we called a 'Mellotron.' It has inside it three dozen different tapes running parallel to each other in loops. . All these tapes are running at the same time, and there is a keyboard on which you can play them like an organ so that it will sound just like a human choir but yet, at the same time, very artificial and really quite eerie."<ref name="Ebert" />
In 1975 Popol Vuh released an album entitled Aguirre. Although ostensibly a soundtrack album to Herzog's film, the six-track LP included only two songs ("Aguirre I (L'Acrime Di Rei)" and "Aguirre II") taken from Aguirre, the Wrath of God. The four remaining tracks were derived from various recordings made by the group between about 1972 and 1974. At the time of Aguirre the band members were Fricke (piano, Mellotron), Fichelscher (electric guitar, acoustic guitar, drums), Djong Yun (vocals), and Robert Eliscu (oboe, pan pipe).
