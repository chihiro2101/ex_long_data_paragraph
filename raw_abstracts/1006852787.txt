He worked as an agent for American speculator William Duer to set up the Scioto Company in Paris in 1788, and to sell worthless deeds to land in the Northwest Territory which it did not own. Scholars believe that he did not know the transactions were fraudulent. He stayed in Paris, becoming involved in the French Revolution. He was elected to the Assembly and given French citizenship in 1792.
In his own time, Barlow was known especially for the epic poem The Columbiad, a later version of the Vision of Columbus (1807),<ref name="papers.ssrn.com">Brian Pelanda, urltoken Declarations of Cultural Independence: The Nationalistic Imperative Behind the Passage of Early American Copyright Laws, 1783-1787, Journal of the Copyright Society of the U.S.A.
