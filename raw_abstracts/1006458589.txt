It is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer science, psychology, and cognitive science.<ref name=TaoTan></ref> While some core ideas in the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical inquiries into emotion,<ref> Cited by Tao and Tan.</ref> the more modern branch of computer science originated with Rosalind Picard's 1995 paper<ref> urltoken "Affective Computing" MIT Technical Report #321 ( urltoken Abstract), 1995</ref> on affective computing and her book Affective Computing<ref name="Affective Computing"></ref> published by MIT Press.<ref>
