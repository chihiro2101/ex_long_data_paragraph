In conventional usage, boredom is an emotional and occasionally psychology state experienced when an individual is left without anything in particular to do, is not interested in their surroundings, or feels that a day or period is dull or tedious. It is also understood by scholars as a modern phenomenon which has a cultural dimension. "There is no universally accepted definition of boredom. But whatever it is, researchers argue, it is not simply another name for depression or apathy. It seems to be a specific mental state that people find unpleasant—a lack of stimulation that leaves them craving relief, with a host of behavioural, medical and social consequences."<ref></ref> According to BBC News, boredom ".can be a dangerous and disruptive state of mind that damages your health"; yet research ".suggests that without boredom we couldn't achieve our creative feats."<ref></ref>

Experience Without Qualities: Boredom and Modernity. Stanford: Stanford University Press. 3.</ref> In both conceptions, boredom has to do fundamentally with an experience of time and problems of meaning.
