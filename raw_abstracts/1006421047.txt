Christianity and Islam are the two largest religions in the world and share a historical traditional connection, with some major theological differences. The two faiths share a common place of origin in the Middle East, and consider themselves to be monotheism.
Christianity is an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion which developed out of Second Temple Judaism in the 1st century CE. It is founded on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and those who follow it are called Christians.<ref></ref>
Islam is an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion that developed in the 7th century CE. Islam, which literally means "submission to God", was founded on the teachings of Muhammad as an expression of ibadah of God. Those who follow it are called Muslims which means "submitter to God".<ref></ref><ref></ref>
Muslims have a range of views on Christianity, from viewing Christians to be People of the Book to regarding them as kafirs (infidels) that commit shirk (polytheism) because of Trinitarianism and as dhimmis (religious taxpayers) under Sharia. Christian views on Islam are diverse and range from considering Islam a fellow Abrahamic religion worshipping the same God, to believing Islam to be heresy or an apostasy cult that denies the Crucifixion and rejects the Jesus in Islam.
Islam considers Jesus to be al-Masih, the Arabic term for Messiah, sent to guide the Israelites (ban카 isr훮'카l in Arabic) with a new revelation: al-Inj카l (Arabic for "the Gospel").<ref></ref><ref name="Understanding Islam and Christianity: Beliefs That Separate Us and How to Talk About Them"></ref><ref>The Oxford Dictionary of Islam, p.158</ref> Christianity believes Jesus to be the Messiah of the Hebrew scripture, the Son of God, and God the Son, while Muslims consider the Trinity to be a division of Tawhid and a grave sin (shirk). Muslims believe Jesus (Isa) to be a messenger of God, not the son of God.
Christianity and Islam have different scriptures, with Christianity using the Bible and Islam using the Quran, though Muslims believe that both the Quran and the Gospel, termed Injeel, were sent by God. Both texts offer an account of the life and works of Jesus. The belief in Jesus is a fundamental part of Islamic theology, and Muslims view the Injeel as tahrif (distorted or altered), while Christians consider their Gospels to be authoritative and the Quran to be a later, fabricated or apocryphal work. Both religions believe in the virgin birth of Jesus through Mary, but the Biblical and Islamic accounts differ.
