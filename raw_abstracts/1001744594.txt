By 2014, a mitochondrial DNA phylogeny including fossil members placed ostriches on the basal branch, followed by rheas, then a clade consisting of moas and tinamous, followed by the final two branches: a clade of emus plus cassowaries and one of elephant birds plus kiwis.<ref name = "Mitchell2014" />
vicariance based on the plate tectonic split-up of Gondwana followed by continental drift would predict that the deepest phylogenetic split would be between African and all other ratites, followed by a split between South American and Australo-Pacific ratites, roughly as observed. However, the elephant bird–kiwi relation appears to require dispersal across oceans by flight,<ref name = "Mitchell2014" /> as apparently does the colonization of New Zealand by the moa and possibly the back-dispersal of tinamous to South America, if the latter occurred.<ref name = "Phillips2010" /> The phylogeny as a whole suggests not only multiple independent origins of flightlessness, but also of gigantism (at least five times).<ref name = "Mitchell2014" /> Gigantism in birds tends to be insular; however, a ten-million-year-long window of opportunity for evolution of avian gigantism on continents may have existed following the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, in which ratites were able to fill vacant herbivorous niches before mammals attained large size.<ref name = "Mitchell2014" /> Some authorities, though, have been skeptical of the new findings and conclusions.<ref name = "Zimmer2014" />
Kiwi and tinamous are the only palaeognath lineages not to evolve gigantism, perhaps because of competitive exclusion by giant ratites already present on New Zealand and South America when they arrived or arose.<ref name = "Mitchell2014" /> The fact that New Zealand has been the only land mass to recently support two major lineages of flightless ratites may reflect the absence of native mammals, which allowed kiwi to occupy a mammal-like nocturnal niche.<ref name="Le DucRenaud2015"/> However, various other landmasses such as South America and Europe have supported multiple lineages of flightless ratites that evolved independently, undermining this competitive exclusion hypothesis.<ref name="Agnolin2016"/>
Most recently, studies on genetic and morphological divergence and fossil distribution show that paleognaths as a whole probably had an origin in the northern hemisphere. Early Cenozoic northern hemisphere paleognaths such as Lithornis, Pseudocrypturus, Paracathartes and Palaeotis appear to be the most basal members of the clade.<ref name="Yonezawa2017" /> The various ratite lineages were probably descended from flying ancestors that independently colonised South America and Africa from the north, probably initially in South America. From South America they could have traveled overland to Australia via Antarctica,<ref name = "Tambussi1994"/> (by the same route marsupials are thought to have used to reach Australia<ref name = "Nilsson2010"/>) and then reached New Zealand and Madagascar via "sweepstakes" dispersals across the oceans. Gigantism would have evolved subsequent to trans-oceanic dispersals.<ref name="Yonezawa2017" />
