Œ (minuscule: œ) is a Latin alphabet grapheme, a ligature of o and e. In medieval and early modern Latin, it was used to represent the Greek diphthong οι and in a few non-Greek words, usages that continue in English and French. In French, it is also used in some non-learned words, representing then Mid front rounded vowel, rather than sounding the same as é or è, those being its traditional French values in the words borrowed from or via Latin.
It is used in the modern orthography for Old Norse and is used in the International Phonetic Alphabet to represent the open-mid front rounded vowel. In English runology, œ is used to transliterate the Runic letter odal (Old English "estate, ancestral home").<ref></ref>
