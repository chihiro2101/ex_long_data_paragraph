In meteorology, wind speed, or wind flow speed, is a fundamental atmosphere quantity caused by air moving from high to low pressure, usually due to changes in temperature. Wind speed is now commonly measured with an anemometer.
Wind speed affects weather forecasting, aviation and maritime operations, construction projects, growth and metabolism rate of many plant species, and has countless other implications.<ref></ref> Note that wind direction is usually almost parallel to isobars (and not perpendicular, as one might expect), due to Earth's rotation.
