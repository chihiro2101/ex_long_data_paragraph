Echocardiography establishes the presence of TOF by demonstrating a VSD, RVH, and aortic override. Many patients are diagnosed prenatally. Color Doppler (type of echocardiography) measures the degree of pulmonary stenosis. Additionally, close monitoring of the ductus arteriosus is done in the neonatal period to ensure that there is adequate blood flow through the pulmonary valve.<ref name="Francois_2016" /><ref name="Abdulla_2011" />
In certain cases, coronary artery anatomy cannot be clearly viewed using echocardiogram. In this case, cardiac catheterization can be done.<ref name="Munoz_2010" />
Form a genetics perspective, it is important to screen for DiGeorge in all babies with TOF.<ref name="Munoz_2010" />
Before more sophisticated techniques became available, chest x-ray was the definitive method of diagnosis. The abnormal "coeur-en-sabot" (boot-like) appearance of a heart with tetralogy of Fallot is classically visible via chest x-ray, although most infants with tetralogy may not show this finding.<ref></ref> The boot like shape is due to the right ventricular hypertrophy present in TOF. Lung fields are often dark (absence of interstitial lung markings) due to decreased pulmonary blood flow.<ref name="Abdulla_2011" />
Electrocardiography shows right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), along with right axis deviation.<ref name="Francois_2016" /> RVH is noted on EKG as tall R-waves in lead V1 and deep S-waves in lead V5-V6.<ref></ref>
