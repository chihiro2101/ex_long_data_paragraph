The media of Canada is diverse and highly regionalized. News media, both print and digital and in both official languages, is largely dominated by a handful of major media corporations. The largest of these corporations is the country’s national public broadcaster, CBC/Radio-Canada, who also plays a significant role in producing domestic cultural content, operating radio and TV networks in both English and French.
Non-news media content in Canada, including film and television, is influenced both by local creators as well as by imports from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France. While Canadian content has historically failed to substantively penetrate foreign markets, this has begun shifting in recent years as platforms like Netflix and CBC Gem enable those media traditionally only popular within Canada to reach foreign audiences.<ref name="GlobermanPolicy1983" />
Television, magazines, and newspapers are primarily for-profit corporations based on advertising, subscription, and other sales-related revenues. Nevertheless, both the television-broadcasting and publications sectors require a number of government interventions to remain profitable, which can include regulation barring foreign companies in the broadcasting industry, as well as tax laws that limit foreign competition in magazine advertising. In addition to CBC, some provincial governments offer their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as TVOntario and Télé-Québec.<ref name="GlobermanPolicy1983"></ref>
The organization Reporters Without Borders compiles and publishes an annual ranking of countries based upon the organization's assessment of their Press Freedom Index. In 2011–12, Canada was ranked 10th out of 179 countries in the world, which was an improvement from the preceding year.<ref></ref> In 2020, Canada ranked 16 out of 180.<ref>" urltoken Canada."
