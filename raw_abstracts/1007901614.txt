Dignity is the right of a person to be valued and respected for their own sake, and to be treated ethically. It is of significance in morality, ethics, law and politics as an extension of the Enlightenment-era concepts of Natural and legal rights. The term may also be used to describe personal conduct, as in "behaving with dignity".
