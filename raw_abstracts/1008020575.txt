In ancient Rome, the Vestals or Vestal Virgins (Latin: Vestālēs, singular Vestālis were priestesses of Vesta, goddess of the hearth. The college of the Vestals was regarded as fundamental to the continuance and security of Rome. These individuals cultivated the sacred fire that was not allowed to go out.
