Harold Newhouser (May 20, 1921 â€“ November 10, 1998), nicknamed "Prince Hal", was an American professional baseball player. In Major League Baseball (MLB), he pitcher 17 seasons on the Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Indians, from 1939 through 1955. Newhouser was an All-Star for six seasons and was considered to be the most dominating pitcher of the World War II era of baseball, winning a pitching triple crown for the Tigers in 1945. To date, he is also the only pitcher in MLB history ever to win two consecutive MVP awards. Newhouser inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1992.
After his retirement from baseball, Newhouser was away from the sport for 20 years, serving as a bank vice president. He later worked as a scout for several MLB teams, including the Houston Astros. Angered when they rebuffed his recommendation to draft future Hall of Famer Derek Jeter in favor of Phil Nevin, he quit shortly after.
