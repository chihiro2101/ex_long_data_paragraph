A common university library can be traced to the beginning of the 15th century, with the first direct reference to a 'library'. In March 1416 the will of William Loring was proved, which bequeathed three volumes to the library thus: "Item volo quod omnes libri mei juris civilis remaneant in communi libraria scolarium universitatis Cantebrigg' in perpetuum." In the second decade of the fifteenth century, the library found a home on the newly built Old Schools site.
The earliest catalogue is dated ca. 1424, at which time there were 122 volumes in the library.<ref>Higgins, Hannah. The Grid Book. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2009. p.180. </ref> The second earliest surviving catalogue was drawn up in 1473, and denotes 330 volumes. From the 16th century, the Library received generous donations or bequests of books and growth was considerably increased once the privilege of legal deposit had been granted.
The library's space was greatly extended with the building of the Cockerell Building on Senate House Passage in 1837&ndash;42.
