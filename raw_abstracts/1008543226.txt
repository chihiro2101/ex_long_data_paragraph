s (non-pigmented plastids that can sometimes differentiate).
The event to permanent endosymbiosis in the Archaeplastida clade (of Embryophyte, red algae, and green algae) probably occurred with a cyanobiont (a symbiotic cyanobacteria) related to the genus Gloeomargarita, around 1.5 billion years ago.<ref></ref><ref></ref> A later primary endosymbiosis event occurred in photosynthetic Paulinella amoeboids about 90–140 million years ago, with the plastid being a sister to the "PS-clade" (of the cyanobacteria genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus).<ref name="Marin Nowack Glöckner Melkonian 2021 p. "></ref> Secondary and tertiary endosymbiosis has also occurred, in a wide variety of organisms; additionally, some organisms sequester ingested plastids in a process that is known as kleptoplasty.
Plastids were discovered and named by Ernst Haeckel, but A. F. W. Schimper was the first to provide a clear definition. They often contain pigments used in photosynthesis, and the types of pigments in a plastid determine the cell's color. They are also the site of manufacture and storage of important chemical compounds used by the cells of autotrophic eukaryotes. They possess a DNA#Base pairing molecule that is circular, like that of the circular chromosome of prokaryotic cells.
