The laughing kookaburra is native to eastern Australia, but has also been introduced to parts of New Zealand, Tasmania, and Western Australia.<ref name=Higgins>
</ref> It occupies dry eucalypt forest, woodland, city parks and gardens.<ref name=Higgins /> This species is sedentary and occupies the same territory throughout the year. It is Monogamy, retaining the same partner for life. A breeding pair can be accompanied by up to five fully grown non-breeding offspring from previous years that help the parents defend their territory and raise their young.<ref name=Higgins /> The laughing kookaburra generally breeds in unlined tree holes or in excavated holes in arboreal termite nests.<ref name=Higgins /> The usual clutch is three white eggs. The parents and the helpers incubate the eggs and feed the chicks. The youngest of the three nestlings or chicks is often killed by the older siblings. When the chicks fledge they continue to be fed by the group for six to ten weeks until they are able to forage independently.<ref name=fry />
A predator of a wide variety of small animals, the laughing kookaburra typically waits perched on a branch until it sees an animal on the ground and then flies down and pounces on its prey.<ref name=Morcombe>Morcombe, Michael (2012) Field Guide to Australian Birds.
