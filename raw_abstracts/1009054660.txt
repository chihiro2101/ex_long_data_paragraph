Nitric oxide (nitrogen oxide<ref>IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry 2005. urltoken PDF.</ref> or nitrogen monoxide) is a colorless gas with the formula . It is one of the principal oxides of nitrogen. Nitric oxide is a free radical, i.e., it has an unpaired electron, which is sometimes denoted by a dot in its chemical formula (·N=O or ·NO). Nitric oxide is also a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, a historic class that drew researches which spawned early modern molecular orbital theory.<ref name=G&E/>
An important intermediate in chemical industry, nitric oxide forms in combustion systems and can be generated by lightning in thunderstorms. In mammals, including humans, nitric oxide is a signaling molecule in many physiological and pathological processes.<ref></ref> It was proclaimed the "Molecule of the Year" in 1992.<ref name="pmid1361684"></ref> The 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded for discovering nitric oxide's role as a cardiovascular signalling molecule.
Nitric oxide should not be confused with nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), a brown gas and major air pollutant, nor with nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), an anesthetic.<ref name="G&E"/>
