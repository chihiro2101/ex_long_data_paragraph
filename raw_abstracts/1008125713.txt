David Curtiss "Steve" Stephenson (August 21, 1891 &ndash; June 28, 1966) was an American convicted rapist and murderer who in 1923 was appointed Grand Dragon of the Indiana Klan in Indiana and head of Klan recruiting for seven other states. Later that year, he led those groups to independence from the Ku Klux Klan. Amassing wealth and political power in Indiana politics, he was one of the most prominent national Klan leaders. "He was viewed as responsible for reviving the Klan and widening its base, and considered the most powerful man in Indiana".<ref name=CL>Criminal Law Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012, John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder</ref> He had close relationships with numerous Indiana politicians, especially Governor Edward L. Jackson.
In Stephenson v. State (1925) Stephenson was tried for and convicted of the abduction, rape, and murder of a young white woman, Madge Oberholtzer, a state education official. His trial, conviction and imprisonment ended the portrayal of Klan leaders as law abiding. The case destroyed the Klan as a political force in Indiana, and significantly damaged its standing nationally.<ref name=CL/> Denied a pardon by Governor Jackson, in 1927 he started talking with reporters for the Indianapolis Times and released a list of elected and other officials who had been in the pay of the Klan. This led to a wave of indictments in Indiana, more national scandals, the rapid loss of tens of thousands of members, and the end of the second wave of Klan activity in the late 1920s.
Stephenson's burial in Mountain Home National Cemetery in Johnson City, Tennessee also led to Congress passing restrictions barring serious sex offenders or those convicted of capital crimes from burial in veterans' cemeteries.
