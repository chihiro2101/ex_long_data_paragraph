A heat exchanger is a system used to transfer heat between two or more fluids. Heat exchangers are used in both cooling and heating processes.<ref>Ahmed T. Al-Sammarraie & Kambiz Vafai (2017) Heat transfer augmentation through convergence angles in a pipe, Numerical Heat Transfer, Part A: Applications, 72:3, 197-214, urltoken The fluids may be separated by a solid wall to prevent mixing or they may be in direct contact.<ref></ref> They are widely used in space heating, refrigeration, air conditioning, power stations, chemical plants, Petrochemical, Oil refinery, natural-gas processing, and sewage treatment. The classic example of a heat exchanger is found in an internal combustion engine in which a circulating fluid known as engine coolant flows through radiator coils and air flows past the coils, which cools the coolant and heats the incoming air. Another example is the heat sink, which is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant.<ref>Salimpour, M.
