The WikiProject for Genealogy aims to improve genealogy-related articles and to standardize and verify genealogical information on Wikipedia. While Wikipedia is not and never was intended as a genealogy software, this area may still be further improved. Nearly all royalty articles include a section of brief ancestry, as well as a list of spouse(s) and issue. This practice may possibly be extended outside the bounds of royalty and aristocracy where encyclopedically relevant, while keeping within Wikipedia's WP:N and WP:V standards.
This project covers all Wikipedia articles related to the subject of genealogy, including businesses, individuals, websites, software, etc. that are involved in the genealogical field. It also covers any genealogical information on notable families, usually formatted as family tree charts, Template:Ahnentafel charts, or lists. Templates to create family trees and ahnentafels are also in the scope of this WikiProject.
