A one-instruction set computer (OISC), sometimes called an ultimate RISC (URISC), is an abstract machine that uses only one instructionobviating the need for a machine language opcode.<ref name=urisc /><ref name=caamp /><ref name=agut /> With a judicious choice for the single instruction and given infinite resources, an OISC is capable of being a universal computer in the same manner as traditional computers that have multiple instructions.<ref name=caamp /> OISCs have been recommended as aids in teaching computer architecture<ref name=urisc /><ref name=caamp /> and have been used as computational models in structural computing research.<ref name=agut />
