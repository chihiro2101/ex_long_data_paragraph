A quiet PC is a personal computer that makes very little or no noise. Common uses for quiet PCs include video editing, sound mixing and home theater PCs, but noise reduction techniques can also be used to greatly reduce the noise from servers. There is currently no standard definition for a "quiet PC",<ref name=WhatisSilentPC></ref> and the term is generally not used in a business context, but by individuals and the businesses catering to them.
A proposed general definition is that the sound emitted by such PCs should not exceed 30 Sound pressure,<ref></ref> but in addition to the average sound pressure level, the frequency spectrum and dynamics of the sound are important in determining if the sound of the computer is noticed. Sounds with a smooth frequency spectrum (lacking audible tonal peaks), and little temporal variation are less likely to be noticed. The character and amount of other noise in the environment also affects how much sound will be noticed or masked, so a computer may be quiet with relation to a particular environment or set of users.<ref name=WhatisSilentPC />
