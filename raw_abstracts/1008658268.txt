Dinitrogen tetroxide, commonly referred to as nitrogen tetroxide (NTO), and sometimes, usually among ex-USSR/Russia rocket engineers, as amyl, is the chemical compound N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. It is a useful reagent in chemical synthesis. It forms an equilibrium mixture with nitrogen dioxide.
Dinitrogen tetroxide is a powerful oxidizer that is hypergolic (spontaneously reacts) upon contact with various forms of hydrazine, which has made the pair a common bipropellant for rockets.
