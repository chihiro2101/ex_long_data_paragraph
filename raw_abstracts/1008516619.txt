Aldgate was one of the gates in the London Wall around the City of London. It gives its name to Aldgate High Street, the first stretch of the A11 road which included the site of the former gate.
The locality of Aldgate, the most common use of the term, is focussed around the former gate and the High Street and includes part of the City and parts of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.<ref name="towerhamlets.gov.uk"> urltoken ALDGATE MASTERPLAN 2007.</ref>
There is also an Aldgate Ward of the City of London, lying inside the line of the wall (until boundary adjustments in the 21st century). The Ward is of ancient origin but almost entirely distinct from the locality around Aldgate High Street which is mostly outside the line of the walls.
