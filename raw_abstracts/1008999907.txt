Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional heavy metal with speed metal, often within symphony context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a faster, lighter, and more uplifting sound, in contrast with the heaviness and dissonance prevalent, for example, in extreme metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally "powerful" sound.<ref> urltoken Neo-classical & Power Metal (progrockandmetal.net)</ref><ref name=Rockdetectordesc> "Riffs became labyrinthine, vocals scorched higher altitudes—and they even managed to crank out some more volume."</ref>
