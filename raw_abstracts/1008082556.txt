Factor V Leiden (rs6025 or F5 p.R506Q<ref name=2019loci></ref>) is a variant (mutated form) of human factor V (one of several substances that helps blood clot), which causes an increase in blood clotting (hypercoagulability). Due to this mutation, protein C, an anticoagulant protein which normally inhibits the pro-clotting activity of factor V, is not able to bind normally to factor V, leading to a hypercoagulable state, i.e., an increased tendency for the patient to form abnormal and potentially harmful blood clots.<ref name="pmid7590506"></ref> Factor V Leiden is the most common hereditary hypercoagulability (prone to clotting) disease amongst ethnic Europeans.<ref name="pmid9109469"></ref><ref name="pmid9415695"></ref><ref name="pmid9763354"></ref> It is named after the Dutch city Leiden, where it was first identified in 1994 by Prof R. Bertina under the direction of (and in the laboratory of) Prof P. Reitsma.<ref name="pmid8164741"></ref> Despite the increased risk of VTE, people with one copy of this gene have not been found to have shorter lives than the general population.<ref name=2011Kujo></ref>
