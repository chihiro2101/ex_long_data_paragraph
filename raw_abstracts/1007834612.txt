Giuseppe "Joe" Zangara (September 7, 1900&nbsp;â€“ March 20, 1933) was an Italian immigrant and naturalized United States citizen who attempted to assassinate then-President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 15, 1933, seventeen days before Roosevelt's inauguration. During a night speech by Roosevelt in Miami, Florida, Zangara fired five shots with a handgun he had purchased a couple of days before. He missed his target and instead injured five bystanders, mortally wounding Anton Cermak, the Mayor of Chicago.
