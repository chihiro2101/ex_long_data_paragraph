The Mistick Krewe of Comus, founded in 1856, is a New Orleans, Louisiana, Carnival krewe. It is the oldest continuous organization of New Orleans Mardi Gras festivities.
Before Comus was organized, Carnival celebrations in New Orleans were mostly confined to the Roman Catholic Creole community, and parades were irregular and often very informally organized. Comus was organized by largely Protestant Anglo-Americans.
