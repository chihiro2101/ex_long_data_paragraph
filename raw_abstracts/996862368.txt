If the eastern and western populations are considered to be separable subspecies, it is unclear which should be considered to be the Subspecies#Nomenclature, since the first description of this species was based on a now-extinct population from Switzerland which is of unknown race.<ref name= Gesner/>
The northern bald ibis is readily distinguished from its close relative, the southern bald ibis of Southern Africa, by the southern species' whitish face.<ref name=SASOL/> The northern bald can also be confused with the similarly dark-plumaged glossy ibis, which overlaps its range, but it is larger and stockier than that species. In flight, when the bill and face colouration may not be visible, the bald ibis' less rounded wings and shorter neck give it a different profile from glossy ibis,<ref name=BWP/> and its relatively short legs mean that its feet do not project beyond the tail, unlike those of the glossy ibis.<ref name= Mullarney/>
