Moshing (also known as slam dancing or simply slamming)<ref></ref> is a style of dance in which participants push or slam into each other, typically performed to "aggressive" live music. Moshing usually happens in the center of the crowd, generally closer to the stage,<ref name=":0"></ref> in an area called the "pit". It is intended to be energetic and full of body contact.
The dance style originated in the hardcore punk scenes of California and Washington, D.C. around 1980. Through the 1980s it spread to other branches of punk rock as well as thrash metal and grunge, which exposed it to the mainstream. Since then, moshing has occasionally been performed to energetic music within a wide variety of genres, including alternative rock, EDM and hip hop, while remaining a staple at punk and heavy metal shows. 
Variations of moshing exist, including "pogoing", "circle pits", and "wall of death". Dancing can be done alone as well as in groups. 
While moshing is seen as a form of positive fan feedback or expression of enjoyment,<ref name="popmusic">Tsitsos, William</ref><ref></ref> it has also drawn criticism over dangerous excesses occurring in offshoots.
