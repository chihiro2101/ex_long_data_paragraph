The Radical Faeries are a loosely affiliated worldwide network and Counterculture movement seeking to redefine queer consciousness through secular spirituality.<ref></ref> Sometimes deemed a form of modern Paganism, the movement also adopts elements from anarchism and environmentalism.
Rejecting hetero-imitation, the Radical Faerie movement began during the 1970s sexual revolution among gay men in the United States.<ref name=remembering></ref> The movement has expanded in tandem with the larger gay rights movement, challenging pink capitalism and patriarchal aspects of modern LGBT life while celebrating New Age and rituals.<ref name=OIPRLG/> Faeries tend to be fiercely independent, anti-establishment, and community-focused.<ref name=OIPRLG/>
The Radical Faerie movement was founded in California in 1979 by gay activists Harry Hay and Don Kilhefner <ref name="The LGBTQ History Project"></ref> Influenced by the legacy of the counterculture of the 1960s, they held the first Spiritual Conference for Radical Fairies in Arizona in September 1979. From there, various regional Faerie Circles were formed, and other large rural gatherings organized. Although Kilhefner and a later, pivotal member, Mitch Walker, broke from Hay in 1980, the movement continued to grow, having expanded into an international network soon after the second Faerie gathering in 1980.
Today Radical Faeries embody a wide range of genders, sexual orientations, and identities. Sanctuaries and gatherings are generally open to all, though several gatherings still focus on the particular spiritual experience of Gay co-creating temporary autonomous zones.<ref name=altreligions></ref> Faerie sanctuaries adapt rural living and environmentally sustainable ways of using modern technologies as part of creative expression.<ref name=OIPRLG/> Radical Faerie communities are sometimes inspired by indigenous, native or Two-Spirit, especially those that incorporate genderqueer sensibilities.<ref> urltoken Encyclopedia of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender history in America Marc Stein, Editor; Charles Scribner's Sons, 2004; , .</ref>
