Iyar or , <small>Standard</small> Iyyar <small>Tiberian</small> ʾIyyār; from "rosette; blossom") is the eighth month of the civil year (which starts on 1 Tishrei) and the second month of the Jewish religious year (which starts on 1 Nisan) on the Hebrew calendar. The name is Babylonian in origin. It is a month of 29 days. Iyar usually falls in April–May on the Gregorian calendar.
In the Hebrew Bible, before the Babylonian captivity, the month is called Ziv , . Ziv is a Hebrew name that means "light" or "glow".
Along with all other current, post-biblical Jewish month names, Iyar was adopted during the Babylonian captivity. In the Babylonian calendar its name was Araḫ Āru, which can be interpreted as "month of blossoming".<ref>Muss-Arnolt, W., www.jstor.org/stable/3259081 The Names of the Assyro-Babylonian Months and Their Regents, Journal of Biblical Literature Vol. 11, No. 1 (1892), pp. 72–94 78, accessed 10 Aug. 2020</ref>
