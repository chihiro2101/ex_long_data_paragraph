Michael J. Behe ; born January 18, 1952) is an American biochemist, author, and advocate of the pseudoscience principle of intelligent design (ID).<ref> Article available from urltoken Universiteit Gent</ref><ref name="EurekAlert! 2019"></ref> He serves as professor of biochemistry at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania and as a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture. Behe is best known as an advocate for the validity of the argument for irreducible complexity (IC), which claims that some biochemical structures are too complex to be explained by known evolution#Mechanisms and are therefore probably the result of intelligent design. Behe has testified in several court cases related to intelligent design, including the court case Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District where his views were cited in the ruling that intelligent design is not science and is religious in nature.<ref name="conclusion">s:Kitzmiller v.

Behe's claims about the irreducible complexity of essential cellular structures have been rejected by the vast majority of the scientific community,<ref>
