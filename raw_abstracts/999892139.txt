USS United States was a wooden-hulled, three-masted heavy frigate of the United States Navy and the first of the six original frigates authorized for construction by the Naval Act of 1794. The name "United States" was among ten names submitted to President George Washington by Secretary of War Timothy Pickering in March of 1795 for the frigates that were to be constructed.<ref>Pickering, Timothy (14 March 1795). urltoken Letter to George Washington.

She was built at Humphrey's shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and launched on 10 May 1797<ref>#Cooper p.125</ref> and immediately began duties with the newly formed United States Navy protecting American merchant shipping during the Quasi-War with France.
In 1861 United States was in port at Norfolk and was seized by the Virginia Navy and subsequently commissioned into the Confederate navy as CSS United States, but was later scuttled by Confederate forces. Union forces raised the scuttled ship, and retained control of the ship until she was broken up in 1865.
