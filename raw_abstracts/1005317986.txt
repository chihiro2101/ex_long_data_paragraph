The Coharie ("Schohari"), which means "Driftwood<ref>North Carolina Rivers: Facts, Legends, and Lore, By John Hairr p. 59</ref>" in Tuscarora, are a Native American tribe who descend from the Tuscarora nation. This Iroquoian-speaking tribe mostly left the state in the early 18th century, under pressure from English colonists and Native American enemies. They had been located in the interior. By 1722 they announced that the tribe had relocated to New York, where they colocated with Iroquois cousins, and became the Sixth Nation of the Iroquois League.
There were remnants of Tuscarora in North Carolina. They gradually intermarried with other peoples, but organized self-government again in the 20th century. They are located chiefly on the Little Coharie River, in Sampson and Harnett counties in North Carolina. The Coharie are one of seven state-recognized Native American tribes in North Carolina.
