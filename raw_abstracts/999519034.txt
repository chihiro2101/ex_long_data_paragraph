The term phi phenomenon is used in a narrow sense for an Illusory motion that is observed if two nearby optical stimuli are presented in alternation with a relatively high frequency. In contrast to beta movement, seen at lower frequencies, the stimuli themselves do not appear to move. Instead, a diffuse, amorphous shadowlike something seems to jump in front of the stimuli and occlude them temporarily. This shadow seems to have nearly the color of the background.<ref name="Ekroll2008"/> Max Wertheimer first described this form of apparent movement in his habilitation thesis, published 1912,<ref name="Wertheimer1912"/> marking the birth of Gestalt psychology.<ref name=Wagemans2012I/>
In a broader sense, particularly if the plural form phi phenomena is used, it applies also to all apparent movements that can be seen if two nearby optical stimuli are presented in alternation. This includes especially beta movement, which is important for the illusion of motion in film and animation.<ref name="Kenkel1913"/><ref name="Blassnigg2009"/> Actually, Wertheimer applied the term "φ-phenomenon" to all apparent movements described in his thesis when he introduced the term in 1912, the objectless movement he called "pure φ".<ref name="Wertheimer1912"/> Nevertheless, some commentators assert that he reserved the Greek letter φ for pure, objectless movement.<ref></ref><ref name=Sekuler1996></ref>
