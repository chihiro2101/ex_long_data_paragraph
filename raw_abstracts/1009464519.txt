The Battle of Hattin took place on 4 July 1187, between the Crusader states of the Levant and the forces of the Ayyubid sultan Saladin (Salah ad-Din). It is also known as the Battle of the Horns of Hattin, due to the shape of the nearby extinct volcano of Kurûn Hattîn.
The Muslim armies under Saladin captured or killed the vast majority of the Crusader forces, removing their capability to wage war.<ref name=Madden2000></ref> As a direct result of the battle, Muslims once again became the eminent military power in the Holy Land, re-conquering Jerusalem and many of the other Crusader-held cities.<ref name=Madden2000/> These Christian defeats prompted the Third Crusade, which began two years after the Battle of Hattin.
