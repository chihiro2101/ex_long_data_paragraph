Maurice Le Noblet Duplessis ; 20 April 1890 &ndash; 7 September 1959) served as the 16th Premier of the Canadian province of Quebec from 1936 to 1939 and 1944 to 1959. He rose to power after uniting his Conservative party and the breakaway Action liberale nationale progressive faction of the Liberal party of Premier Louis-Alexandre Taschereau, to form a new national-conservative party, the Union Nationale.<ref></ref>
His era was later labeled as La Grande Noirceur ("The Great Darkness") by its critics, due to his support of strong Catholic traditions, his support of private property rights vis-a-vis growing labour rights movements, and his strong opposition not only to Communism, but also to secularism, feminism, environmentalism, leftist separatism and other non-conservative and progressive political trends and movements that would influence Quebec politics and society over the following 60 years, starting with the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s under his Liberal successor Jean Lesage.
During the Duplessis time, the Liberal opposition was unsuccessful in challenging Duplessis' power in 3 elections (1948, 1952 and 1956).
Duplessis championed rural areas, provincial rights, nationalism, economic development, strong investment in Catholic education and anti-Communism, and had a hard stance against the trade unions.
