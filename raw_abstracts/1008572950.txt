Oleg is the East Slavic rendering of the Old Norse name Helgi. 
He is credited by Rus' Chronicles with moving from either Staraya Ladoga or Veliky Novgorod, and seizing power in Kiev (Kyiv) from Askold, and, by doing so, laying the foundation of the powerful state of Kievan Rus'. He also launched at least one attack on Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire. According to East Slavic chronicles, Oleg was the supreme ruler of the Rus' from 879 to 912. 
Oleg was the first christian ruler of the Rus, he had a brother he was fighting with, about having their nephew Igor (Igor the Old), in their kingdom, because Igor was the Crownprince.

The nature of Oleg's relationship with the Rurikid ruling family of the Rus', and specifically with his successor Igor of Kiev, is a matter of much controversy among historians.
