The mineral bastnäsite (or bastnaesite) is one of a family of three carbonate-fluoride minerals, which includes bastnäsite-(Ce) with a formula of (Ce, La)CO<sub>3</sub>F, bastnäsite-(La) with a formula of (La, Ce)CO<sub>3</sub>F, and bastnäsite-(Y) with a formula of (Y, Ce)CO<sub>3</sub>F. Some of the bastnäsites contain OH<sup>&minus;</sup> instead of F<sup>&minus;</sup> and receive the name of hydroxylbastnasite. Most bastnäsite is bastnäsite-(Ce), and cerium is by far the most common of the rare earths in this class of minerals. Bastnäsite and the phosphate mineral monazite are the two largest sources of cerium and other rare-earth elements.
Bastnäsite was first described by the Swedish chemist Wilhelm Hisinger in 1838. It is named for the Bastnäs mine near Riddarhyttan, Västmanland, Sweden.<ref name=webmineral/>
Bastnäsite also occurs as very high-quality specimens at the Zagi Mountains, Pakistan.
Bastnäsite occurs in alkali granite and syenite and in associated pegmatites. It also occurs in carbonatites and in associated fenites and other metasomatism.<ref name=Handbook/><ref> urltoken Bastnasite . Mineral Galleries. Retrieved on 2011-10-14.</ref>
