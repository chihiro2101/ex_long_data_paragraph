Physical information is a form of information. In physics, it refers to the information of a physical system. Physical information is an important concept used in a number of fields of study in physics. For example, in quantum mechanics, the form of physical information known as quantum information is used to describe quantum phenomena such as entanglement and superposition.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> In thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, the concept of physical information is likewise used to describe phenomena related to thermodynamic entropy. (See Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory for an overview of this subject). The concept of information is also important in relativity, since correlations between events in spacetime can be measured in terms of physical information.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> 
In a general sense, information is that which resolves uncertainty about the state of a physical system at a given moment in time. Information can also be understood as a measure of probability as follows: a physical state with a low initial probability of observation contains a relatively high quantity of physical information, while a state with a high initial probability of observation contains a relatively low quantity of physical information. 
When clarifying the subject of information, care should be taken to distinguish between the following specific cases:
* The phrase instance of information refers to the specific instantiation of information (identity, form, essence) that is associated with the being of a particular example of a thing. (This allows for the reference to separate instances of information that happen to share identical patterns.)
* A holder of information is a variable or mutable instance that can have different forms at different times (or in different situations).
* A piece of information is a particular fact about a thing's identity or properties, i.e., a portion of its instance.
* A pattern of information (or form) is the pattern or content of an instance or piece of information. Many separate pieces of information may share the same form. We can say that those pieces are perfectly correlated or say that they are copies of each other, as in copies of a book.
* An embodiment of information is the thing whose essence is a given instance of information.
* A representation of information is an encoding of some pattern of information within some other pattern or instance.
* An interpretation of information is a decoding of a pattern of information as being a representation of another specific pattern or fact.
* A subject of information is the thing that is identified or described by a given instance or piece of information. (Most generally, a thing that is a subject of information could be either abstract or concrete; either mathematical or physical.)
* An amount of information is a quantification of how large a given instance, piece, or pattern of information is, or how much of a given system's information content (its instance) has a given attribute, such as being known or unknown. Amounts of information are most naturally characterized in logarithmic units.
As the above usages are all conceptually distinct from each other, overloading the word "information" (by itself) to denote (or connote) several of these concepts simultaneously can lead to confusion. Accordingly, this article uses more detailed phrases, such as those shown in bold above, whenever the intended meaning is not made clear by the context.
