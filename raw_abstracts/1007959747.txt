The helots ; , heílotes) were a subjugated population that constituted a majority of the population of Laconia and Messenia – the territories comprising Sparta. There has been controversy since antiquity as to their exact characteristics, such as whether they constituted an ethnicity, a social class, or both. For example, Critias described helots as "slaves to the utmost",<ref>Apud Libanios, Orationes 25, 63 = Frag. 37 DK; see also Plutarch, Li hi Lycurgus 28, 11.</ref> whereas according to Pollux, they occupied a status "between Freedman and slaves".<ref>Pollux 3, 83. The expression probably originates in Aristophanes of Byzantium; Cartledge, p.139.</ref> Tied to the land, they primarily worked in agriculture as a majority and economically supported the Spartan citizens.
The number of helots in relation to Spartan citizens varied throughout the history of the Spartan state; according to Herodotus, there were seven helots for each Spartan at the time of the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC.<ref>Herodotus. Histories 9.10.</ref> Thus the need to keep helot population in check and prevent rebellion was one of the main concerns of the Spartans. Helots were ritually mistreated, humiliated and even slaughtered: every autumn the Spartans would declare war on the helots so they could be killed by a member of the Crypteia without fear of religious repercussion.<ref>Plutarch, Life of Lycurgus, 28, 3–7.</ref><ref>Herakleides Lembos Fr. Hist. Gr. 2, 210.</ref><ref>Athenaeus, 657 D.</ref> Uprisings and attempts to improve the lot of the helots did occur, such as the Conspiracy of Cinadon.
