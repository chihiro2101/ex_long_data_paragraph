Memín Pinguín is a Mexican comic book character. He was created in 1943 by comics writer Yolanda Vargas Dulché and author Sixto Valencia Burgos in a comic book magazine called "Pepín" and given his own magazine in 1947. Alberto Cabrera took over drawing from 1953 until 1962, followed by Sixto Valencia Burgos. 
The original series had 372 chapters printed in sepia, and it has been republished in 1952 and 1961. In 1988 it was re-edited colorized, and in 2004 was re-edited again. Valencia worked on the reissues over the years, updating the drawings (clothes, settings and backgrounds) for the re-edits. It contains comedy and soap opera elements. However, since 2008 Valencia no longer works on the comic, having departed publishing house Editorial Vid.<ref> urltoken
