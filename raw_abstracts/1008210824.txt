A shock jock is a type of radio broadcaster or disc jockey who entertains listeners or attracts attention using humor and/or Melodrama exaggeration that some portion of the listening audience may find offensive. The term is usually used pejoratively to describe provocative or irreverent broadcasters whose mannerisms, statements and actions are typically offensive to many members of the community. It is a popular term, generally used within the radio industry. A shock jock is considered to be the radio equivalent of the tabloid newspaper, for which entertaining readers is as important as, or more important than, providing factual information. Within the radio industry, a radio station that relies primarily on shock jocks for its programming is said to have a hot talk format.
Confusingly, the term has been used in two broad (but sometimes overlapping) contexts:
# The radio announcer who deliberately makes outrageous, controversial, or shocking statements, or does boundary-pushing stunts to improve ratings.
# The political radio announcer who has an emotional outburst in response to a controversial government policy decision.
