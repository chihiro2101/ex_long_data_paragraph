Politically, he is associated with the left because of his long-standing ties to the Communist Party of Greece. He was an MP for the KKE from 1981 to 1990. Nevertheless, in 1989 he ran as an independent candidate within the centre-right New Democracy party, in order for the country to emerge from the political crisis that had been created due to the numerous scandals of the government of Andreas Papandreou,<ref>Theodorakis: / The Ways of the Archangel, Autobiography, Volume V, p. 331 sq</ref> and helped establish a large coalition between conservatives, socialists and leftists. In 1990 he was elected to the parliament (as in 1964 and 1981), became a government minister under Constantine Mitsotakis, and fought against drugs and terrorism and for culture, education and better relations between Greece and Turkey. He continued to speak out in favor of left-liberal causes, Greek–Turkish–Cypriot relations, and against the War in Iraq.<ref></ref><ref></ref> He has consistently opposed oppressive regimes and was a key voice against the 1967–1974 Greek junta, which imprisoned him and banned his songs.<ref>Theodorakis: Journal of Resistance</ref>
