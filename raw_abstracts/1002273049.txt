USS San Marcos (LSD-25) was a the United States Navy, named for the Castillo de San Marcos, the oldest masonry fort still standing in the United States. In 1911, the second-class battleship had also briefly borne the name San Marcos, perhaps for the town of San Marcos, Texas. The ship served in the United States Navy from 1945 to 1970. In 1971, the vessel was loaned to the Spanish Navy as Galicia (TA31), before being outright transferred in 1974. In 1980, the vessel's pennant number was changed to L31. Galicia was taken out of service by the Spanish Navy in 1988 and was scrapped in 1989.
