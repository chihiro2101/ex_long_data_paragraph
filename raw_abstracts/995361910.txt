The Jesus movement was an evangelical Christian movement beginning on the West Coast of the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s and spreading primarily throughout North America, Europe, and Central America, before subsiding by the late 1980s. Members of the movement were called Jesus people, or Jesus freaks.
Its predecessor, the charismatic movement, had already been in full swing for about a decade. It involved mainline Protestants and Catholic Church who testified to having supernatural experiences similar to those recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, especially glossolalia. Both of these movements held that they were calling the church back to a more biblical picture of Christianity, in which the spiritual gift would be restored to the Church.<ref>Sherrill, John and Elizabeth, They Speak with Other Tongues, Chosen Books, 2011</ref>
The Jesus movement left a legacy that included the formation of various denominations as well as other Christian organizations, and it also influenced the development of both the contemporary Christian right and Christian left.
