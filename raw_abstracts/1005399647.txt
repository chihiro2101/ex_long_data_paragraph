Reinke's edema is the swelling of the vocal folds due to fluid (edema) collected within the Reinke's space.<ref name=":0"></ref> First identified by the German anatomist Friedrich B. Reinke in 1895, the Reinke's space is a gelatinous layer of the vocal cord located underneath the outer cells of the vocal cord.<ref>F. B. Reinke. Untersuchungen über das menschliche Stimmband. Fortschritte der Medizin, München, 1895, 13: 469-478.</ref><ref name=":1"></ref> When a person speaks, the Reinke's space vibrates to allow for sound to be produced (phonation). The Reinke's space is sometimes referred to as the superficial lamina propria.<ref></ref>
Reinke's edema is characterized by the "sac-like" appearance of the fluid-filled vocal cords.<ref name=":6" /> The swelling of the vocal folds causes the voice to become deep and hoarse. Therefore, the major symptom of Reinke's edema is a hoarseness similar to laryngitis. The major cause associated with Reinke's edema is smoking. In fact, 97% of patients diagnosed with Reinke's edema are habitual smokers. Other identified risk factors include overuse of the vocal cords, gastroesophageal reflux, and hypothyroidism.<ref name=":2"></ref> The disease is more often cited in women than in men, because lower voice changes are more noticeable in women.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />
The first cases of Reinke's edema were recorded in 1891 by M. Hajek,<ref></ref> followed by F. Reinke in 1895. In his investigations, Reinke injected a stained glue into the superficial lamina propria (Reinke's space) to mimic edema.<ref></ref> Reinke's edema is considered to be a benign (non-cancercous) urltoken polyp (protrusion) that represents 10% of all benign larynx pathologies.<ref name=":1" /> Treatment of Reinke's edema starts with the elimination of associated risk factors, such as smoking, gastric reflux, and hypothyroidism. Advanced cases may undergo urltoken phonosurgery to remove the fluid from the vocal cords.<ref name=":2" />
