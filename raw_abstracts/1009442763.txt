Sir Thomas Hicks, (born 17 December 1936), known professionally as Tommy Steele, is an English entertainer, regarded as Britain's first teen idol and rock and roll star. He reached number one with "Singing the Blues" in 1957, and The Tommy Steele Story was the first album by a UK act to reach number one in his native country.
Steele's film credits include Half a Sixpence, The Happiest Millionaire and Finian's Rainbow (musical) and he has made many stage tours in the UK. He is also a songwriter, author, and sculptor.
In 2012, Steele was among the cultural icons selected by pop-artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in "Vintage Blake", a montage to celebrate Blake's 80th birthday.<ref></ref>
