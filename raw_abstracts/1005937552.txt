A bicycle frame is the main component of a bicycle, onto which wheels and other components are fitted. The modern and most common frame design for an upright bicycle is based on the safety bicycle, and consists of two triangles: a main triangle and a paired rear triangle. This is known as the diamond frame.<ref name="Diamond"></ref> Frames are required to be strong, stiff and light, which they do by combining different materials and shapes.
A frameset consists of the frame and fork of a bicycle and sometimes includes the headset and seat post.<ref></ref> Frame builders will often produce the frame and fork together as a paired set.
