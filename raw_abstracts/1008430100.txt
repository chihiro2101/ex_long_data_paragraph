Alternative text is text associated with an image that serves the same purpose and conveys the same essential information as the image.<ref name=G94/> In situations where the image is not available to the reader, perhaps because they have turned off images in their web browser or are using a screen reader due to a visual impairment, the alternative text ensures that no information or functionality is lost.<ref name=G94/> Absent or unhelpful alternative text can be a source of frustration for visually impaired users.<ref name=Lazar2007/>
On Wikipedia, alternative text is typically supplied through a combination of the image caption and the text supplied for the image <code>alt</code> parameter in the MediaWiki markup. The following example produces the adjacent image:
<blockquote><code><nowiki></nowiki></code></blockquote>
The <code>alt</code> parameter text ("Painting of Napoleon Bonaparte in His Study at the Tuileries") is not normally visible to readers; however, it may be displayed by web browsers when images are switched off, or read out loud by screen readers for those with visual impairment, and can be used by search engines to determine the content of the image.<ref name=WebAIM /> In keeping with other Internet guidelines, the term "<code>alt</code> text" (in a <code>code</code> font) is used here to refer to the text supplied for the image <code>alt</code> parameter and which generates text for the alt attribute; the term "alternative text" refers to the text equivalent for an image, regardless of where that text resides.<ref name=nearbytext> urltoken G74: Providing a long description in text near the non-text content, with a reference to the location of the long description in the short description, WCAG 2.0 technique.<br/>WebAim writes: "The alt attribute (sometimes called the alt tag, though technically this is incorrect) is not the only mechanism for providing the content and function of the image. This information can also be provided in text adjacent to the image or within the page containing the image. . The term alternative text, as used in this article, refers to the text equivalent for an image, regardless of where that text resides. It does not refer solely to the alt attribute of the image tag.

For images that link to their image description page (which is nearly all images on Wikipedia), the <code>alt</code> text cannot be blank nor should the <code>alt</code> parameter be absent. This is because a screen reader, in order to describe the purpose of the link, will default to reading out the image filename when no <code>alt</code> text is available.<ref>W3C. urltoken F89: Failure (.) due to using null alt on an image where the image is the only content in a link, Techniques for WCAG 2.0, accessed November 5, 2014</ref> This is usually not helpful. In the above Napoleon example, the screen reader would have read out "link graphic slash Jacques hyphen Louis underscore David underscore zero one seven" had we not supplied the <code>alt</code> parameter.<ref>WebAIM says: "An image that is the only thing inside a link must never have a missing or null <code>alt</code> attribute. This is because the screen reader must read SOMETHING to identify the link." See WebAIM, urltoken Context is Everything, accessed 30 September 2020.</ref>
An image that is purely decorative (provides no information and serves only an aesthetic purpose) requires no alternative text. Often the caption fully meets the requirements for alternative text. However, the only situation where blank <code>alt</code> text is acceptable is where such images are unlinked, which is rarely possible. One solution is to provide something at least minimally useful such as , , or . Another solution, if a caption doesn't already describe or identify the image, is for the <code>alt</code> text to do so as briefly as possible.
