Cornbread is any quick bread containing cornmeal, popular in Native American cuisine as well as well as in Greek,<ref></ref> Portuguese and in Turkish cuisine. They are usually leavened by baking powder.<ref name=powder>The acid-base reaction effected by baking powder mixed with the water-based liquids in the dough releases gas that causes the bread to rise during baking. Yeast is a living organism that releases gas under low-temperature conditions as it rises before baking. The yeast bodies continue rising so long as sufficient nutrients and proper warmth exist. During baking the temperature exceeds that which the yeast bodies can tolerate, and they die.</ref>
