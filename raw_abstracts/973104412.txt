Sedimentology encompasses the study of modern sediments such as sand,<ref>Raymond Siever, Sand, Scientific American Library, New York (1988), .</ref> silt, and clay,<ref>Georges Millot, translated from the French by W.R. Farrand, Helene Paquet, Geology Of Clays - Weathering, Sedimentology, Geochemistry Springer Verlag, Berlin (1970), .</ref> and the processes that result in their formation (erosion and weathering), transport, deposition and diagenesis.<ref>Gary Nichols, Sedimentology & Stratigraphy, Wiley-Blackwell, Malden, MA (1999), .</ref> Sedimentologists apply their understanding of modern processes to interpret geologic history through observations of sedimentary rocks and sedimentary structures.<ref>Donald R.

Sedimentary rocks cover up to 75% of the Earth's surface, record much of the Earth's history, and harbor the fossil record. Sedimentology is closely linked to stratigraphy, the study of the physical and temporal relationships between rock layers or strata.
The premise that the processes affecting the earth today are the same as in the past is the basis for determining how sedimentary features in the rock record were formed. By comparing similar features today to features in the rock record—for example, by comparing modern sand dunes to dunes preserved in ancient aeolian sandstones—geologists reconstruct past environments.
