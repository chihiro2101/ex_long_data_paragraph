Schräge Musik, which may also be spelled Schraege Musik, was a common name for the fitting of an upward-firing autocannon or machine gun, to an interceptor aircraft, such as a night fighter. The term was introduced by the German Luftwaffe during World War II. "Schräge Musik" was previously a German colloquialism, meaning music that featured an unusual tuning and/or time signature. By itself, the word Schräge has often been translated as "slanting" or "oblique", although it may instead be rendered into English as "weird" or "strange". 
The first such systems were been devised World War I. They 
were also developed and used by the Japanese military during World War II. Like the Luftwaffe, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS) and Imperial Japanese Army Air Service (IJAAS) fitted such weapons to twin-engined night fighters. Both the Luftwaffe and IJNAS had their first victories with upward-firing autocannons in May 1943. Night fighters used them to approach and attack Allied bombers from below, outside the bomber crew's field of view and/or defensive fire. Many of the commonly-used Allied night bomber aircraft of that era (such as the Avro Lancaster) lacked ventral turrets (such as ball turrets), making them vulnerable to approaches and attacks from below. 
In the initial stages of its use operational use by German air crews, from mid-1943 to early 1944, many attacks using Schräge Musik achieved complete surprise while destroying bombers. The Allied bomber crews that survived such attacks, during this period, often believed that damage and casualties had been caused by ground-based anti-aircraft artillery (AA or AAA),<ref>Wilson 2008, p. 3.</ref> rather than fighters. The complete technical details and tactical usage of German Schräge Musik systems were not fully understood by Allied air forces until after the end of the war in Europe.<ref></ref>
