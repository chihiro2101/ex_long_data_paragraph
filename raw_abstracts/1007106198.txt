Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking protocol, operating on ports 1812 and 1813, that provides centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA or Triple A) management for users who connect and use a network service. RADIUS was developed by Livingston Enterprises, Inc. in 1991 as an access server authentication and accounting protocol and later brought into the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards.
RADIUS is a client/server protocol that runs in the application layer, and can use either TCP or UDP as transport. Network access servers, the gateways that control access to a network, usually contain a RADIUS client component that communicates with the RADIUS server.<ref name="ciscohow" /> RADIUS is often the back-end of choice for 802.1X authentication as well.<ref name="Brown2006"></ref>
The RADIUS server is usually a background process running on a UNIX or Microsoft Windows server.<ref name="ciscohow"></ref>
