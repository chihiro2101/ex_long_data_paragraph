Jacob Joseph Frank<ref></ref> ; ;<ref></ref><ref name="slownik"></ref> born Jakub Lejbowicz; 1726 – December 10, 1791) was an 18th-century Polish Jews<ref name="auto"/> religious leader who claimed to be the reincarnation of the self-proclaimed messiah Sabbatai Zevi (1626–1676) and also of the biblical patriarch Jacob. The Jewish authorities in Poland excommunicated Frank and his followers due to his heretical doctrines that included deification of himself as a part of a trinity and other controversial concepts such as neo-Carpocratian "purification through transgression".<ref>Maciejko (2003)</ref><ref name="ciekawe.onet.pl"></ref>
Frank arguably created a new denomination of Judaism, now referred to as Frankism, which incorporated some aspects of Christianity into Judaism. The development of Frankism was one of the consequences of the messianic movement of Sabbatai Zevi. This religious mysticism followed socioeconomic changes among the Jews of Poland, Lithuania and Ruthenia.
