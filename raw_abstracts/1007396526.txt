Dawn is the time that marks the beginning of twilight before sunrise. It is recognized by the appearance of indirect sunlight being scattered in Earth's atmosphere, when the centre of the Sun's disc has reached 18° below the observer's horizon.<ref></ref> This morning twilight period will last until sunrise (when the Sun's upper limb breaks the horizon), when daylight outshines the diffused light.
