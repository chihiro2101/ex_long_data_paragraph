The Pacific Coast Ranges (officially gazetted as the Pacific Mountain System<ref> urltoken Physiographic regions of the United States, USGS</ref> in the United States but referred to as the Pacific Coast Ranges),<ref> urltoken Merriam-Webster's collegiate encyclopedia, page 361 (Merriam-Webster, 2000).</ref> are the series of mountain ranges that stretch along the West Coast of North America from Alaska south to Northern and Central Mexico. Although they are commonly thought to be the westernmost mountain range of the continental United States and Canada, the geologically distinct Insular Mountains of Vancouver Island lie further west.
The Pacific Coast Ranges are part of the North American Cordillera (sometimes known as the Western Cordillera, or in Canada, as the Pacific Cordillera and/or the Canadian Cordillera), which includes the Rocky Mountains, Columbia Mountains, Interior Mountains, the Interior Plateau, Sierra Nevada (U.S.), the Great Basin mountain ranges, and other ranges and various plateaus and basins.
The Pacific Coast Ranges designation, however, only applies to the Western System of the Western Cordillera,<ref name="S. Holland, 1976">S. Holland, Landforms of British Columbia, BC Govt. 1976.</ref> which comprises the Saint Elias Mountains, Coast Mountains, Insular Mountains, Olympic Mountains, Cascade Range, Oregon Coast Range, California Coast Ranges, Transverse Ranges, Peninsular Ranges, and the Sierra Madre Occidental.
