George of Kunštát and Podebrady (23 April 1420 – 22 March 1471), also known as Poděbrad or Podiebrad ; , was the sixteenth King of Bohemia, who ruled between years 1458–1471. He was a leader of the Hussites, however, moderate and tolerant toward the Catholicism. His rule was marked by great efforts to preserve peace and tolerance between the Hussites and Catholics in the religiously divided Crown of Bohemia – hence his contemporary nicknames: "King of two peoples" and "Friend of peace" (přítel míru).
During the 19th century, in period of the so-called Czech National Revival, he began to be praised (even somewhat idealized) as the last Czech national monarch (in terms of ethnic awareness), a great diplomat and a courageous fighter against the domination of the Catholic Church. In modern times he is remembered mainly for his idea and attempt to establish common European Christian institutions, which is now seen as the first historical vision of European unity.
