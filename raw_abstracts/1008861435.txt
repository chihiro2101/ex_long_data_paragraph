The S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction is a type of reaction mechanism that is common in organic chemistry. In this mechanism, one bond is broken and one bond is formed synchronously, i.e., in one step. S<sub>N</sub>2 is a kind of nucleophilic substitution reaction mechanism, the name referring to the Hughes-Ingold symbol of the mechanism. Since two reacting species are involved in the slow (rate-determining) step, this leads to the term substitution nucleophilic (bimolecular) or S<sub>N</sub>2; the other major kind is SN1 reaction.<ref></ref> Many other more specialized mechanisms describe substitution reactions.
The reaction type is so common that it has other names, e.g. "bimolecular nucleophilic substitution", or, among inorganic chemists, "associative substitution" or "interchange mechanism".
