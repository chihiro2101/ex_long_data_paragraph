The cytoskeleton is a complex, dynamic network of interlinking protein filaments present in the cytoplasm of all cells, including bacteria and archaea.<ref name="Hardin"></ref> It extends from the cell nucleus to the cell membrane and is composed of similar proteins in the various organisms. In eukaryotes, it is composed of three main components, microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules, and these are all capable of rapid growth or disassembly dependent on the cell's requirements.<ref></ref>
A multitude of functions can be performed by the cytoskeleton. Its primary function is to give the cell its shape and mechanical resistance to deformation, and through association with extracellular connective tissue and other cells it stabilizes entire tissues.<ref name="Alberts"></ref><ref name="Herrmann" /> The cytoskeleton can also contract, thereby deforming the cell and the cell's environment and allowing cells to migrate.<ref name="Fletcher"></ref> Moreover, it is involved in many cell signaling pathways and in the uptake of extracellular material (endocytosis),<ref name="Geli1998"></ref> the segregation of chromosomes during Cell division,<ref name="Alberts" /> the cytokinesis stage of cell division,<ref name="Wickstead2011"></ref> as scaffolding to organize the contents of the cell in space<ref name="Fletcher" /> and in intracellular transport (for example, the movement of vesicles and organelles within the cell)<ref name="Alberts" /> and can be a template for the construction of a cell wall.<ref name="Alberts" /> Furthermore, it can form specialized structures, such as flagella, cilia, lamellipodia and podosomes. The structure, function and dynamic behavior of the cytoskeleton can be very different, depending on organism and cell type.<ref name="Alberts" /><ref name="Wickstead2011" /> Even within one cell, the cytoskeleton can change through association with other proteins and the previous history of the network.<ref name="Fletcher" />
A large-scale example of an action performed by the cytoskeleton is muscle contraction. This is carried out by groups of highly specialized cells working together. A main component in the cytoskeleton that helps show the true function of this muscle contraction is the microfilament. Microfilaments are composed of the most abundant cellular protein known as actin.<ref name=":2" /> During contraction of a muscle, within each muscle cell, myosin molecular motors collectively exert forces on parallel actin filaments. Muscle contraction starts from nerve impulses which then causes increased amounts of calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Increases in calcium in the cytosol allows muscle contraction to begin with the help of two proteins, tropomyosin and troponin.<ref name=":2"></ref> Tropomyosin inhibits the interaction between actin and myosin, while troponin senses the increase in calcium and releases the inhibition.<ref></ref> This action contracts the muscle cell, and through the synchronous process in many muscle cells, the entire muscle.
