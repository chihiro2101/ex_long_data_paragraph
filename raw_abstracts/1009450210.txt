, also known as Freeza in Funimation's English subtitles and Viz Media's release of the manga, is a Character (arts) and villain in the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. Frieza makes his debut in Chapter #247: , first published in Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on October 24, 1989,<ref>Weekly Shōnen Jump #47 October 24, 1989</ref> as a galactic tyrant feared as the most powerful being in the universe.
Despite not appearing until the manga's second half, Frieza is considered to be the most iconic villain from the Dragon Ball franchise. He effectively served as the catalyst of many of the events depicted in the story, due to the destruction of the Saiyan homeworld Planet Vegeta at his hands. The consequential events included Goku's arrival on Earth, the remnants of the Saiyans landing on Earth many years later, and the main characters' subsequent journey to the planet Namek. In his appearances within the series, he is also directly responsible for the murder of Goku's father Bardock, the genocide of the Saiyan species, the first death of Vegeta, and the second death of Goku's best friend Krillin, which triggers Goku's very first Super Saiyan transformation. This arguably makes Frieza stand out as Goku's archenemy. The final confrontation between Goku and Frieza has been hailed as one of the most memorable manga and anime battles ever.
Frieza later appears as the primary villain in the theatrical film Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F' and as a recurring character in Dragon Ball Super.
