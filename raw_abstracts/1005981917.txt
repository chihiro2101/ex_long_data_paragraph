Pointillism , <ref></ref> is a technique of painting in which small, distinct dots of color are applied in patterns to form an image.
Georges Seurat and Paul Signac developed the technique in 1886, branching from Impressionism. The term "Pointillism" was coined by art critics in the late 1880s to ridicule the works of these artists, but is now used without its earlier mocking connotation.<ref name=artcyclopedia /> The movement Seurat began with this technique is known as Neo-impressionism. The Divisionism used a similar technique of patterns to form images, though with larger cube-like brushstrokes.<ref>Ruhrberg, Karl. "Seurat and the Neo-Impressionists".
