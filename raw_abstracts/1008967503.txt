is the royal house of Sweden, since its foundation in 1818. It was also the royal house of Norway between 1818 and 1905. Its founder Charles XIV John of Sweden, was born in Pau in southern France as Jean Bernadotte. Bernadotte, who had been made a brigadier general for his service in the French Royal Army during the French Revolution, was adopted by the elderly King Charles XIII of Sweden, who had no other heir and whose Holstein-Gottorp branch of the House of Oldenburg thus was soon to be extinct on the Swedish throne.
