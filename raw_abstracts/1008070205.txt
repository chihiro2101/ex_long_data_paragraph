Webcomics (also known as online comics or Internet comics) are comics published on a website or mobile app. While many are published exclusively on the web, others are also published in magazines, newspapers, or comic books.
Webcomics can be compared to self-published print comics in that anyone with an Internet connection can publish their own webcomic. Readership levels vary widely; many are read only by the creator's immediate friends and family, while some of the largest claim audiences well over one million readers.<ref name=PWFeb2012></ref><ref name=ComicsAllianceOct2012></ref><ref name=USATodayOct2011></ref> Webcomics range from traditional comic strips and graphic novels to avant garde comics, and cover many genres, styles, and subjects.<ref name="CCP"></ref> They sometimes take on the role of a comic blog.<ref></ref> The term web cartoonist is sometimes used to refer to someone who creates webcomics.
