Adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency type 1 or AMPD1, is a human metabolic disorder in which the body consistently lacks the enzyme AMP deaminase,<ref name="mda-overview"></ref> in sufficient quantities. This may result in exercise intolerance, myalgia and muscle cramping. The disease was formerly known as myoadenylate deaminase deficiency or MADD. While it is usually a recessive genetic disorder, there is also a rarer, acquired form of AMP deficiency.
The genetic form of AMPD1 is caused by a defect in the genetic mechanism for production of AMP deaminase, is an enzyme that converts adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP).<ref name=ghr2008/> While it affects approximately 1â€“2% of people in populations of predominantly European descent,<ref name=ghr2008></ref> the disorder appears to be considerably rarer in Asian populations.<ref name=ghr2008/>
