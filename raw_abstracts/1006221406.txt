Space rock is a genre characterized by loose and lengthy song structures centered on instrumental textures that typically produce a hypnotic, otherworldly sound.<ref name="AllMusic"></ref> It may feature distorted and reverberation-laden guitars, minimal drumming, languid vocals, synthesizers and lyrical themes of outer space and science fiction.
The genre emerged in late 1960s psychedelia and progressive rock bands such as Pink Floyd, Hawkwind,<ref name="AllMusic"/> and Gong<ref></ref> who explored a "cosmic" sound. Later, the style was taken up in the mid-1980s by Spacemen 3, whose "drone-heavy" sound was avowedly inspired by and intended to accommodate drug use. By the 1990s, space rock developed into shoegazing and post-rock<ref name="AllMusic"/> with bands such as Failure, Hum, Flying Saucer Attack, and Orange Goblin.
