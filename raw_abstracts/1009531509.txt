Leopold pledged to suppress the east African slave trade; promote humanitarian policies; guarantee free trade within the colony; impose no import duties for twenty years; and encourage philanthropic and scientific enterprises. Beginning in the mid-1880s, Leopold first decreed that the state asserted rights of proprietorship over all vacant lands throughout the Congo territory. In three successive decrees, Leopold promised the rights of the Congolese in their land to native villages and farms, essentially making nearly all of the CFS terres domainales (state-owned land).<ref></ref> Leopold further decreed that merchants should limit their commercial operations in rubber trade with the natives. Additionally, the colonial administration liberated thousands of slaves.<ref>David Northrup. Beyond the Bend in the River.

Four main problems presented themselves over the next few years.
# Leopold II ran up huge debts to finance his colonial endeavor and risked losing his colony to Belgium.<ref name=":1"></ref>
# Much of the Free State was unmapped jungle, which offered little fiscal and commercial return.
# Cecil Rhodes, Prime Minister of the Cape Colony (part of modern South Africa), was expanding his British South Africa Company's charter lands from the south and threatened to occupy Katanga (southern Congo) by exploiting the "Principle of Effectivity" loophole in the Berlin Treaty. In this he was supported by Harry Johnston, the British Central Africa, who was London's representative in the region.<ref>Joseph Moloney: With Captain Stairs to Katanga.

# The Congolese interior was ruled by Arab Zanzibari slavers and sultans, powerful kings and warlords who had to be coerced or defeated by use of force. For example, the slaving gangs of Zanzibar trader Tippu Tip had a strong presence in the eastern part of the territory in the modern-day Maniema, Tanganika and Ituri regions. They were linked to the Swahili coast via Uganda and Tanzania and had established independent slave states.
