A hagiography ; <ref></ref> or vita (from Latin vita, life, which begins the title of most medieval biographies) is a biography of a saint or an ecclesiastical leader, and by extension, an adulatory and idealized biography of a founder, saint, monk, nun or icon in any of the world's religions.<ref name="MongeChirico2016"></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
Christian hagiographies focus on the lives, and notably the miracles, ascribed to men and women canonized by the Roman Catholic church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodoxy, and the Church of the East. Other religious traditions such as Buddhism,<ref>Jonathan Augustine (2012), Buddhist Hagiography in Early Japan, Routledge, </ref> Hinduism,<ref>David Lorenzen (2006), Who Invented Hinduism?, Yoda Press, , pp.&nbsp;120â€“121</ref> Islam, Sikhism and Jainism also create and maintain hagiographical texts (such as the Sikh Janamsakhis) concerning saints, gurus and other individuals believed to be imbued with sacred power.
Hagiographic works, especially those of the Middle Ages, can incorporate a record of institutional and local history, and evidence of popular cults, customs, and traditions.<ref>Davies, S. (2008).

Aberystwyth, UK: Department of Information Studies, Aberystwyth University. p. 5.20. </ref> However, when referring to modern, non-ecclesiastical works, the term hagiography is often used as a pejorative reference to biography and historian whose authors are perceived to be uncritical of or reverential toward their subject.
