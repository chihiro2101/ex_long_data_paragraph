Passing is the ability of a person to be regarded as a member of an Identity (social science) different from their own, which may include racial identity, ethnicity, caste, social class, sexual orientation, gender, religion, age and/or disability<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1"></ref><ref name=":2"></ref><ref name=":6"></ref> Passing may result in privileges, rewards, or an increase in social acceptance,<ref name=":0"></ref><ref name=":1" /> or be used to cope with stigma. Thus, passing may serve as a form of self-preservation or self-protection in instances where expressing one's true or prior identity may be dangerous.<ref name=":6" /><ref></ref> Passing may require acceptance into a community and may also lead to temporary or permanent leave from another community to which an individual previously belonged. Thus, passing can result in separation from one's original self, family, friends, or previous living experiences.<ref name=":03" /> While successful passing may contribute to economic security, safety, and avoidance of stigma, it may take an emotional toll as a result of denial of one's previous identity and may lead to depression or self-loathing.<ref name=":6" />
Etymology, the term is simply the nominalisation of the verb pass in its phrasal use with for or as, as in a counterfeit passing for the genuine article or an impostor passing as another person. It has been in popular use since at least the late 1920s.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
