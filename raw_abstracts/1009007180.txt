The Skywalker family is a fictional legendary family in the Star Wars franchise. Within the series' fictional universe, the Skywalkers are presented as a bloodline with strong inherent capabilities related to the Force. Luke Skywalker, his twin sister Princess Leia, and their father Darth Vader are central characters in the Star Wars original trilogy. Darth Vader, in his previous identity as Anakin Skywalker, is the lead character in the prequel film trilogy; his mother Shmi is a minor character in the first and second film respectively. Leia and Han Solo's son (and hence Luke's nephew and Anakin and Padmé's grandson) Ben Solo, renamed Kylo Ren, is the antagonist of the sequel trilogy. Shmi, Han, and Padmé are the only members who are not Force-sensitive.
