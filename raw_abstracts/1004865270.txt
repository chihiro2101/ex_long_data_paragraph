Boranes is the name given to the class of synthetic hydrides of boron with generic formula B<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y</sub>. In the past, borane molecules were often labeled "electron-deficient" because of their multicenter bonding (in which a pair of bonding electrons links more than two atoms, as in 3-center-2-electron bonds); this was done in order to distinguish such molecules from hydrocarbons and other classically bonded compounds. However, this usage is incorrect, as most boranes and related clusters such as carboranes are actually electron-precise, not electron-deficient. For example, the extremely stable icosahedral B<sub>12</sub>H<sub>12</sub><sup>2−</sup> dianion, whose 26 cluster valence electrons exactly fill the 13 bonding molecular orbitals, is in no actual sense deficient in electrons; indeed it is thermodynamically far more stable than benzene.<ref>1 R.

While some boranes are highly reactive with respect to electron-pair donors, others are not, e.g., the B<sub>n</sub>H<sub>n</sub><sup>2−</sup> dianions (n = 6-12) as well as many neutral boranes such as B<sub>18</sub>H<sub>22</sub>. Some lower boranes are pyrophoric in air and react with water. The boranes belong to the class of cluster compounds, which have been the subject of developments in chemical bond. Many of the related anionic hydridoborates have also been synthesized.
