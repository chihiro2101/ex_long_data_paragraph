Pectin (from , "congealed, curdled"<ref>.</ref>) is a structural acidic heteropolysaccharide contained in the primary and middle lamella and cell walls of terrestrial plants. Its main component is galacturonic acid, a sugar acid derived from galactose. It was first isolated and described in 1825 by Henri Braconnot.<ref>Braconnot, Henri (1825) urltoken "Recherches sur un nouvel acide universellement répandu dans tous les vegetaux" (Investigations into a new acid spread throughout all plants), Annales de chimie et de physique, series 2, 28 : 173-178. From page 178: … je propose le nom pectique, de πηχτες, coagulum, … ( … I propose the name pectique, from πηχτες pectes, coagulum coagulated material, clot, or curd, … ).</ref><ref></ref> It is produced commercially as a white to light brown powder, mainly extracted from citrus fruits, and is used in food as a gelling agent, particularly in jams and jellies. It is also used in dessert fillings, medicines, sweets, as a stabilizer in fruit juices and milk drinks, and as a source of dietary fiber.
