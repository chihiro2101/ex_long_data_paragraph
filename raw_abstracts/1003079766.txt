The gens Tullia was a family at ancient Rome, with both patrician and plebs branches. The first of this gens to obtain the consulship was Manius Tullius Longus in 500 BC, but the most illustrious of the family was Cicero, the statesman, orator, and scholar of the first century BC. The earliest of the Tullii who appear in history were patrician, but all of the Tullii mentioned in later times were plebeian, and some of them were descended from freedman.<ref name="DGRBM Tullia Gens">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography & Mythology, vol.
