It is not true that "Howl" was written as a performance piece and later published by poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti of City Lights Books. This myth was perpetuated by Ferlinghetti as part of the defense's case during Howl#1957 obscenity trial.<ref>Howl was published in the Evergreen Review, Volume 1, No. 2 (1957).</ref> Upon the poem's release, Ferlinghetti and the bookstore's manager, Shigeyoshi Murao, were charged with disseminating obscene literature, and both were arrested. On October 3, 1957, Judge Clayton W. Horn ruled that the poem was not obscene.<ref name=Morgan>Morgan, Bill and Joyce Peters. Howl on Trial.(2006) p. xiii.</ref>
