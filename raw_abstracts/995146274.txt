Febrile seizures are due to fevers,<ref name=Ron2008/> usually those greater than .<ref name=Neuro2012></ref> The cause of the fevers is often a viral illness.<ref name=AFP2012/> The likelihood of a febrile seizure is related to how high the temperature reaches.<ref name=AFP2012/><ref name="Leu2018" /> Some feel that the rate of increase is not important<ref name=AFP2012/> while others feel the rate of increase is a risk factor.<ref name=Engel2008/> This latter position has not been proven.<ref name=Engel2008></ref>
In children, illnesses that often cause a fever include Otitis media and Upper respiratory tract infection.<ref name=AAP2017></ref> Other infections associated with febrile seizures include Shigellosis, Salmonellosis, and Roseola.<ref name=AAP2017 /> Although the exact mechanism is unknown, it is speculated that these infections may affect the brain directly or via a neurotoxin leading to seizures.<ref name=AAP2017 />
There is a small chance of a febrile seizure after certain vaccines.<ref name=Mon2017/> The risk is only slightly increased for a few days after receiving one of the implicated vaccines during the time when the child is likely to develop a fever as a natural immune response.<ref name="Leu2018" /> Implicated vaccines include:<ref name="Mon2017"></ref><ref name="Leu2018" />
* MMRV vaccine
* DTaP-IPV/Hib vaccine 
* DPT vaccine, which is not used in North America anymore
* some versions of the pneumococcal vaccine
* some types of inactivated influenza vaccine
It was previously thought that febrile seizures were more likely to occur with the combined MMRV vaccine, but recent studies have found there to be no significant increase.<ref name=":3"></ref> Overall, febrile seizures triggered by vaccines are uncommon.<ref name=":3" /> Children who have a genetic predisposition towards febrile seizures are more likely to have one after vaccination.<ref name=":3" />
The seizures occur, by definition, without an intracranial infection or metabolic problems.<ref name=AFP2012/> They run in families with reported family history in approximately 33% of people.<ref name=AFP2012/><ref name="Leu2018" /> Several genetic associations have been identified,<ref name="pmid16887333"></ref> including GEFS+ and Dravet syndrome.<ref name=BMJ2015 /> Possible modes of inheritance for genetic predisposition to febrile seizures include autosomal dominance with reduced penetrance and Polygene multifactorial inheritance.<ref name=":2" /><ref name="Leu2018" /> An association with iron deficiency has also been reported, particularly in the developing world.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
