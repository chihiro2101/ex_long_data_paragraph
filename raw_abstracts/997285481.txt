In linguistics, hyponymy (from Greek ὑπό, hupó, "under", and ὄνυμα, ónuma, "name") is a semantics between a hyponym denoting a subtype and a hypernym or hyperonym denoting a supertype. In other words, the semantic field of the hyponym is included within that of the hypernym.<ref></ref> In simpler terms, a hyponym is in a ontology components with its hypernym. For example: pigeon, crow, eagle, and seagull are all hyponyms of bird, their hypernym; which itself is a hyponym of animal, its hypernym.<ref></ref>
Hypernymy or hyperonymy (from Greek ὑπέρ, hupér, "over", and ὄνυμα, ónuma, "name") is the converse of hyponymy.
Other names for hypernym include umbrella term and blanket term.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> A synonym of co-hyponym based on same tier (and not hyponymic) relation is allonym (which means "different name").
A hyponym refers to a type. A meronym refers to a part. For example, a hyponym of tree is pine tree or oak tree (a type of tree), but a meronym of tree is bark or leaf (a part of tree).
