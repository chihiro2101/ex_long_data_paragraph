Zinfandel (also known as Primitivo) is a variety of black-skinned wine grape. The variety is grown in over 10 percent of California wine.<ref name="CA area"></ref> DNA analysis has revealed that it is genetically equivalent to the Croatian grapes Crljenak Kaštelanski and Tribidrag, as well as to the Primitivo variety traditionally grown in Apulia (the "heel" of Italy), where it was introduced in the 18th century.<ref name="Financial Times">Jancis Robinson, " urltoken The Great Grapevine" in The Financial Times, October 12th, 2012</ref> The grape found its way to the United States in the mid-19th century, where it became known by variations of a name applied to a different grape, likely "Zierfandler" from Austria.
The grapes typically produce a robust red wine, although in the United States a semi-sweet rosé (blush-style) wine called White Zinfandel has six times the sales of the red wine.<ref name="USsales"></ref> The grape's high sugar content can be fermented into levels of alcohol exceeding 15 percent.<ref name="Sullivan"></ref>
The taste of the red wine depends on the ripeness of the grapes from which it is made. Red berry fruit flavors like raspberry predominate in wines from cooler areas<ref name="Peterson"/> and in wines made from the earlier-ripening Primitivo clone.
