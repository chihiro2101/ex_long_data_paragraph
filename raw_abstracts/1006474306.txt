In the social sciences, a social group can be defined as two or more people who interact with one another, share similar characteristics, and collectively have a sense of unity. Other theorists disagree however, and are wary of definitions which stress the importance of interdependence or objective similarity.<ref name="Turner (1982)"></ref><ref name="Platow et al. (2011)"></ref> Instead, researchers within the social identity approach generally define it as "a group is defined in terms of those who identify themselves as members of the group."<ref name="Reicher, S.D.
