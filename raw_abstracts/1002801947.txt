In aeronautics, the fuselage ; from the French fusel√© "spindle-shaped") is an aircraft's main body section. It holds crew, passengers, and cargo. In single-engine aircraft, it will usually contain an engine, as well, although in some amphibious aircraft the single engine is mounted on a pylon attached to the fuselage, which in turn is used as a floating hull. The fuselage also serves to position the control and stabilization surfaces in specific relationships to Surface lift, which is required for aircraft stability and maneuverability.
