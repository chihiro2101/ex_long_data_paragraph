Members of Parliament (MPs) sitting in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom are not permitted to resign their seats.<ref name=EB1911></ref> To circumvent this prohibition, MPs who wish to step down are instead appointed to an "office of profit under the Crown," which disqualifies them from sitting in Parliament. For this purpose, a legal fiction is maintained where two unpaid offices are considered to be offices of profit: Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, and Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead. Although the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 lists hundreds of offices that are disqualifying, no MP has lost their seat by being appointed to an actual office since 1981, when Thomas Williams became a judge.<ref name="HCIO"/>
