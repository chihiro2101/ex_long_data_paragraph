Calmodulin (CaM) (an abbreviation for calcium-modulated protein) is a multifunctional intermediate calcium-binding messenger protein expressed in all Eukaryote.<ref></ref> It is an intracellular target of the secondary messenger Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required for the activation of calmodulin. Once bound to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, calmodulin acts as part of a calcium Signal transduction by modifying its interactions with various target proteins such as kinases or phosphatases.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref name=":2"></ref>
