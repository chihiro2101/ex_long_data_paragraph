The Biefeld–Brown effect is an electrical phenomenon that produces an ionic wind that transfers its momentum to surrounding neutral particles. It describes a force observed on an asymmetric capacitor when high voltage is applied to the capacitor's electrodes.<ref name=":0"></ref> Once suitably charged up to high DC potentials, a thrust at the negative terminal, pushing it away from the positive terminal, is generated.<ref name=":1"></ref> The effect was named by inventor Thomas Townsend Brown who claimed that he did a series of experiments with professor of astronomy Paul Alfred Biefeld, a former teacher of Brown whom Brown claimed was his mentor and co-experimenter at Denison University in Ohio.<ref>The present day Denison University claims they have no record of such experiments being carried out, or of any association between Brown and Biefeld. urltoken Paul Schatzkin, Defying Gravity: The Parallel Universe of T.

The use of an asymmetric capacitor, with the negative electrode being larger than the positive electrode, allowed for more thrust to be produced in the direction from the low-flux to the high-flux region compared to a conventional capacitor.<ref name=":1" /> These asymmetric capacitors became known as Asymmetrical Capacitor Thrusters (ACT).<ref name=":2"></ref> The Biefeld–Brown effect can be observed in ionocrafts and lifters, which utilize the effect to produce thrust in the air without requiring any combustion or moving parts.<ref name=":0" />
In his 1960 patent titled "Electrokinetic Apparatus," Brown refers to electrokinesis to describe the Biefeld–Brown effect, linking the phenomenon to the field of electrohydrodynamics (EHD).<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> Brown also believed the Biefeld–Brown effect could produce an anti-gravity force, referred to as "electrogravitics" based on it being an electricity/gravity phenomenon.<ref> urltoken Paul Schatzkin, Defying Gravity: The Parallel Universe of T.
