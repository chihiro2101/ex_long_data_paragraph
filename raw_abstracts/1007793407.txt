Prefect (from the Latin praefectus, substantive adjectival<ref> urltoken Adam's Latin Grammar</ref> form of praeficere: "put in front", i.e., in charge) is a Magistrate title of varying definition, but essentially refers to the leader of an administrative area.
A prefect's office, department, or area of control is called a prefecture, but in various post-Roman empire cases there is a prefect without a prefecture or vice versa. The words "prefect" and "prefecture" are also used, more or less conventionally, to render analogous words in other languages, especially Romance languages.
