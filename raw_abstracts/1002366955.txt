Kerogen is solid, insoluble organic matter in sedimentary rocks. Consisting of an estimated 10<sup>16</sup> tons of carbon, it is the most abundant source of organic compounds on earth, exceeding the total organic content of living matter 10,000-fold. It is insoluble in normal organic solvents and it does not have a specific chemical formula. Upon heating, kerogen converts in part to liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons. Petroleum and natural gas form from kerogen.<ref></ref> Kerogen may be classified by its origin: lacustrine (e.g., Algae), marine (e.g., planktonic), and terrestrial (e.g., pollen and spores). The name "kerogen" was introduced by the Scottish organic chemist Alexander Crum Brown in 1906,<ref name=ox>Oxford English Dictionary 3rd Ed.

Oil-Shales of Lothians iii. 142 (1906) "We are indebted to Professor Crum Brown, F.R.S., for suggesting the term Kerogen to express the carbonaceous matter in shale that gives rise to crude oil in distillation."</ref> derived from the Greek for "wax birth" (Greek: κηρός "wax" and -gen, γένεση "birth").
Increasing production of hydrocarbons from shale has motivated a revival of research into the composition, structure, and properties of kerogen. Many studies have documented dramatic and systematic changes in kerogen composition across the range of thermal maturity relevant to the oil and gas industry. Analyses of kerogen are generally performed on samples prepared by acid demineralization with Supercritical drying, which isolates kerogen from the rock matrix without altering its chemical composition or microstructure.<ref></ref>
