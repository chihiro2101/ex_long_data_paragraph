The English-only movement, also known as the Official English movement, is a political movement that advocates for the use of only the English language in official United States government operations through the establishment of English as the only official language in the US. The US has never had a legal policy proclaiming an official national language. However, at some times and places, there have been various moves to promote or require the use of English, such as in Native American boarding schools. U.S. English is the nation's oldest and largest organization advocating for Official English. The movement has come to be seen as a far right talking point in contemporary US politics, and a dog whistle for racism against non-English speakers in the country. <ref></ref>
