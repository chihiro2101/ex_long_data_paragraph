Lar Gand, known mainly as Mon-El (and alternatively as Valor and M'Onel), is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the Legion of Super-Heroes, Superboy, and Superman. The character has been reinterpreted over the years, but in all versions, he serves as a hero with abilities similar to those of Superman, sometimes serving as a substitute for him.
The first live-action version of the character was introduced in Season 2 of Supergirl, played by Chris Wood. He is the leader and founder of the Legion of Superheroes. He was part of the main cast until he left at the end of the third season. Wood returned in the 100th episode of the fifth season.
