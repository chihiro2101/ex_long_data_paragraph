National Council Against Health Fraud

== History ==
According to archived website, the NCAHF evolved from three separate organizations. The Lehigh Valley Committee Against Health Fraud, Inc. (LVCAHF, now called Quackwatch) was founded in 1969 by Stephen Barrett and H. William Gross, D.D.S. in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The Southern California Council Against Health Fraud (SCCAHF) had its origin in 1976 at Loma Linda University with academic colleagues William T. Jarvis and Gordon Rick as co-founders. Thomas H. Jukes of University of California, Berkeley founded the third organization, an unnamed group in northern California.<ref name="NCAHF_history"></ref>
For a time between 1998 and 2000, the NCAHF operated under the name National Council for Reliable Health Information (NCRHI). The organization became inactive in 2002, and its legal entity was formally dissolved in 2011.<ref name="NCAHF_history"/>
== Mission statement ==
According to NCAHF's mission statement, its activities and purposes included:
* Investigating and evaluating claims made for health products and services.
* Educating consumers, professionals, business people, legislators, law enforcement personnel, organizations and agencies about health fraud, misinformation, and quackery.
* Providing a center for communication between individuals and organizations concerned about health misinformation, fraud, and quackery.
* Supporting sound consumer health laws
* Opposing legislation that undermines consumer rights.
* Encouraging and aiding legal actions against those who violate consumer protection laws.
* Sponsoring a free weekly e-mail newsletter.<ref name="NCAHF_mission_statement"></ref>
NCAHF's positions on consumer health issues were based on what they considered ethical and scientific principles that underlie consumer protection law. Required were:
* Adequate disclosure in labeling and other warranties to enable consumers to make proper choices;
* Premarketing proof of safety and efficacy for products and services that claim to prevent, alleviate, or cure any disease or disorder; and
* Accountability for those who violate consumer laws.<ref name="NCAHF_mission_statement"/>
NCAHF stated that its funding was primarily derived from membership dues, newsletter subscriptions, and consumer information services. Membership was open to everyone, with members and consultants located all over the world. NCAHF's officers and board members served without compensation. NCAHF stated they united consumers with health professionals, educators, researchers, attorneys, and others.
== Position on health issues ==
=== Acupuncture ===
The NCAHF asserted that acupuncture is scientifically unproven as a modality of treatment. In 1990, it said that research during the past twenty years had failed to demonstrate that acupuncture was effective against any disease. Perceived effects of acupuncture are, argued the NCAHF, probably due to a combination of expectation, suggestion and other psychological mechanisms. The NCAHF pointed out that acupuncture was banned in China in 1929 but underwent a resurgence in the 1960s. The organization also advocated that insurance companies should not be required to cover acupuncture treatment and that licensure of lay acupuncturists should be phased out.<ref name=humber></ref><ref name=NCAHF_position_acupuncture></ref><ref name="CordÃ³n"></ref>
=== Amalgam fillings ===
There has been some controversy regarding the use of amalgam fillings by dentists,<ref name=Hyson></ref> because the amalgam contains mercury. Some forms of mercury are toxic to humans, but the NCAHF cites the CDC in stating that there is no evidence that "the health of the vast majority of people with amalgam is compromised" or that "removing amalgam fillings has a beneficial effect on health".<ref name=CDC_amalgam> urltoken CDC Factsheet on amalgam </ref> The NCAHF criticizes those who they believe exploit unfounded public fears for financial gain.<ref name=huggins></ref> NCAHF asserts that breath, urine and blood testing for mercury are inaccurate. Other tests for mercury exposure described by the NCAHF as invalid can include skin testing, stool testing, hair analysis and electrodermal testing.<ref name=NCAHF_position_amalgam></ref>
=== Chiropractic ===
The NCAHF contended that chiropractic can be dangerous and lead to injury or permanent disability.<ref name=NCAHF_position_chiropractic_hazardous></ref> However, the NCAHF did not categorically oppose the practice. It differentiated between chiropractors who promote what it considered good and bad chiropractic practices. The former promote methods of diagnosis and treatment which have a scientific basis. For example, NCAHF claims there is no scientific support for vertebral subluxation.<ref name=NCAHF_position_chiropractic_cause></ref> Their view is that chiropractors should restrict their scope of practice to neuromusculoskeletal problems such as muscle spasms, strains, sprains, fatigue, imbalance of strength and flexibility, stretched or irritated nerve tissue, and so forth. Chiropractors should refer cases involving pathology to qualified medical practitioners.<ref name="chiropactor_description"></ref>
In contrast, what the NCAHF considered bad are those chiropractors who believe the spinal adjustment will cure or alleviate a variety of diseases, such as infection, arthritis, cancer, diabetes, nutritional deficiencies or excesses, appendicitis, blood disorders, or kidney disease. These practitioners may use unproven, disproven, or questionable methods, devices, and products such as adjusting machines, applied kinesiology, chelation therapy, colonic irrigation, computerized nutrition deficiency tests, cranial osteopathy, cytotoxic food allergy testing, DMSO, Gerovital, glandular therapy, hair analysis, herbal crystallization analyses, homeopathy, internal managements, iridology, laser beam acupuncture, laetrile, magnetic therapy,and so forth.<ref name=chiropactor_recommendations></ref>
=== Diet advice ===
The NCAHF was opposed to dietary recommendations and practices not supported by scientific evidence, including behavior-related claims.<ref name=NCAHF_position_diet></ref> Unverified assessment methods such as iridology, applied kinesiology, and routine hair analysis for assessment of nutritional status are criticized. NCAHF and some of its members have long opposed implementation of beliefs that they characterize as unfounded or unscientific.<ref name=wtloss></ref>
NCAHF also questioned the health claims, marketing, safety, efficacy and labeling of many dietary supplement. Herbal preparations are regulated as foods, rather than as drugs, in the United States.<ref name=DSHEA> urltoken Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, Accessed from the Food and Drug Administration website, 5 January 2007.</ref> The NCAHF advocates regulations for a special OTC category called "Traditional Herbal Remedies" (THRs) with an adverse reaction surveillance program, product batches marked for identification and tracking, package label warnings about proposed dangers of self-treatment, oversight requirements from outside of the herbal industry, and strong penalties for unapproved changes in herbal product formulations.<ref name="herbal"> urltoken NCAHF Position Paper on Over-the Counter Herbal Remedies, 1995, accessed online 31 Dec 2006.</ref>
=== Diploma mills ===
The NCAHF asserted that many unqualified practitioners are able to mislead the public by using diploma mills or "degree mills" to get "specious degrees". Diploma mills are not accredited, and frequently engage in "pseudoscience and food faddism". NCAHF also noted that "some of the 'faculty' or 'academic' advisors at several of these schools have criminal convictions in the area of health fraud". NCAHF considers diploma mills harmful to the students and to the public.<ref name=diploma_mills></ref>

The journal Dynamic Chiropractic, while highly critical of NCAHFs views on chiropractic, has written: "The National Council Against Health Fraud is considered a valuable information source for many agencies nationwide. They are well networked and, as demonstrated by their past history, are able to influence the efforts of various agencies and insurance carriers. The NCAHF's ability to publish its opinions and hold these types of conferences does make them a substantial "player" in the area of health fraud."<ref name="chiroweb"></ref>
In 1998, the AMA's Council on Scientific Affairs used NCAHF board member John Renner as a contributing source for some of the content in their "Report 12."<ref name=A-97></ref>
== Criticism from alternative medicine supporters ==
The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) criticised a 2002 PBS broadcast which included an episode about chiropractic<ref name=PBSVideos> - PBS.</ref><ref name=adjusting_the_joints></ref> in which the NCAHF was involved. ACA president Daryl D. Wills responded to PBS officials stating (in part): "I find it ironic that a program titled 'Scientific American Frontiers' would completely ignore the scientific foundation of the chiropractic profession. The chiropractic portion of the June 4 episode titled 'A Different Way to Heal?' irresponsibly characterized chiropractic care -- a legitimate, research-based form of health care -- as a fraudulent hoax." and that "the producers of your program could not have expected objectivity" from the NCAHF.<ref name="PBS"></ref><ref name=reply> urltoken My Reply to the American Chiropractic Association. - Robert S. Baratz, M.D., D.D.S, Ph.D., president, NCAHF</ref> The producer<ref name=producer> urltoken Chedd-Angier, PBS Producer.</ref> of the program replied in detail and explicitly denied these allegations: "The segment did not claim that chiropractic is fraudulent and did not attempt to prove or disprove that chiropractic 'works,' but it does state that chiropractic has no basis in science. This conclusion is entirely justified by both current research and generally accepted views of human anatomy."<ref name="PBS_response"> urltoken PBS Producer's response, June 11, 2002. </ref>

The National Council Against Health Fraud (NCAHF) was a not-for-profit, US-based organization, that described itself as a "private nonprofit, voluntary health agency that focuses upon health misinformation, fraud, and quackery as public health problems."<ref name="NCAHF_website"></ref>
