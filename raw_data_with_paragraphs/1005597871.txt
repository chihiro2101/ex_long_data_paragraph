USS Thresher (SSN-593)

==Alternative theory of the sinking: electrical failure==
On 8 April 2013, Bruce Rule, an acoustic data expert, published his own analysis of the data collected by USS Skylark and Atlantic SOSUS arrays in a paper<ref> urltoken "What Sank The Thresher", Bruce Rule, 10 April 2013</ref> in the Navy Times.<ref> urltoken "50 years later, a look at what really sank the Thresher", Bruce Rule and Norman Polmar, 4 April 2013 (Navy Times link)</ref><ref name="navtimespdf"> urltoken "What Sank The Thresher", Bruce Rule and Norman Polmar, 8 April 2013</ref> Rule based his analysis on SOSUS data that was highly classified in 1963 and was not discussed in open session of the Court of Inquiry and was not revealed at the congressional hearings.<ref name="navtimespdf"/> A retired Navy captain and former commanding officer of the same class of submarine as Thresher, citing Rule's findings, has called for the U.S. government to declassify the data associated with the boat's sinking, and presented an alternative disaster sequence based upon the acoustic data.<ref name=USNI /><ref> urltoken 
Rule concluded that the primary cause of the sinking was a failure of the electrical bus that powered the main coolant pumps. According to Rule, SOSUS data indicates that after two minutes of electrical instability, the bus failed at 09:11&nbsp;a.m., causing the main coolant pumps to trip off. This caused an immediate reactor scram, resulting in a loss of propulsion. Thresher could not be deballasted because ice had formed in the high-pressure air pipes, and so she sank. Rule's analysis holds that flooding (whether from a silver brazed joint or anywhere else) played no role in the reactor scram or the sinking, and that Thresher was intact until she imploded. In addition to the SOSUS data that does not record any sound of flooding, the crew of Skylark did not report hearing any noise that sounded like flooding, and Skylark was able to communicate with Thresher, despite the fact that, at test depth, even a small leak would have produced a deafening roar. Additionally, the previous commander of Thresher testified that he would not have described flooding, even from a small-diameter pipe, as a "minor problem".<ref name="navtimespdf"/>
Rule interprets the communication "900" from Thresher at 09:17&nbsp;a.m. as a reference to test depth, signifying that Thresher was below her test depth of , or below sea level. According to Rule the SOSUS data indicates an implosion of Thresher at 09:18:24, at a depth of , below her predicted collapse depth. The implosion took 0.1 seconds, too fast for the human nervous system to perceive.<ref name="navtimespdf"/>
==SUBSAFE legacy==
When the Court of Inquiry delivered its final report, it recommended that the Navy implement a more rigorous program of design review and safety inspections during construction. That program, launched in December 1963, was known as SUBSAFE. From 1915 to 1963, the U.S. Navy lost a total of 16 submarines to non-combat accidents. Since the inception of SUBSAFE only one submarine has suffered a similar fate, and that was , which sank in 1968 for reasons still undetermined. Scorpion was not SUBSAFE certified.<ref></ref>

During the 1963 inquiry, Admiral Hyman Rickover stated:
<blockquote>I believe the loss of the Thresher should not be viewed solely as the result of failure of a specific braze, weld, system or component, but rather should be considered a consequence of the philosophy of design, construction and inspection that has been permitted in our naval shipbuilding programs. I think it is important that we re-evaluate our present practices where, in the desire to make advancements, we may have forsaken the fundamentals of good engineering.<ref></ref></blockquote>
