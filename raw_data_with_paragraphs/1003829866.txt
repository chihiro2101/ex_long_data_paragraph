Sleep paralysis

== Signs and symptoms ==
The main symptom of sleep paralysis is being unable to move or speak during awakening.<ref name=Sharp2016/>
Imagined sounds such as humming, hissing, static, zapping and buzzing noises are reported during sleep paralysis.<ref>Thorpy, M.J. (ed). (1990). 'Sleep paralysis'. ICSD-International Classification of Sleep Disorders: Diagnostic and Coding Manual. Rochester, Minn.: American Sleep Disorders Association.</ref> Other sounds such as voices, whispers and roars are also experienced. It has also been known that one may feel pressure on their chest during an episode.<ref></ref> These symptoms are usually accompanied by intense emotions such as fear and panic.<ref name=Blackmore2002 /> People also have sensations of being dragged out of bed or of flying, numbness, and feelings of electric tingles or vibrations running through their body.<ref name="Cheyneninenine" />
Sleep paralysis may include hypnagogia hallucinations, such as a supernatural creature suffocating or terrifying the individual, accompanied by a feeling of pressure on one's chest and Shortness of breath.<ref name=":1"></ref> Another example of a hallucination involves a menacing shadowy figure entering one's room or lurking outside one's window, while the subject is paralyzed.<ref></ref>
== Pathophysiology ==
The pathophysiology of sleep paralysis has not been concretely identified, although there are several theories about its cause.<ref name=":0"></ref> The first of these stems from the understanding that sleep paralysis is a parasomnia resulting from dysfunctional overlap of the REM and waking stages of sleep.<ref name=Goldstein></ref> Polysomnographic studies found that individuals who experience sleep paralysis have shorter REM sleep latencies than normal along with shortened NREM and REM sleep cycles, and fragmentation of REM sleep.<ref name=Walther></ref> This study supports the observation that disturbance of regular sleeping patterns can precipitate an episode of sleep paralysis, because fragmentation of REM sleep commonly occurs when sleep patterns are disrupted and has now been seen in combination with sleep paralysis.<ref name=Walther />
Another major theory is that the neural functions that regulate sleep are out of balance in such a way that causes different sleep states to overlap.<ref name=Cheyneninenine></ref> In this case, cholinergic sleep “on” neural populations are hyperactivated and the serotonergic sleep “off” neural populations are under-activated.<ref name=Cheyneninenine /> As a result, the cells capable of sending the signals that would allow for complete arousal from the sleep state, the serotonergic neural populations, have difficulty in overcoming the signals sent by the cells that keep the brain in the sleep state.<ref name=Cheyneninenine /> During normal REM sleep, the threshold for a stimulus to cause arousal is greatly elevated. Under normal conditions, medial and vestibular nuclei, cortical, thalamic, and cerebellar centers coordinate things such as head and eye movement, and orientation in space.<ref name=Cheyneninenine />
In individuals reporting sleep paralysis, there is almost no blocking of exogenous stimuli, which means it is much easier for a stimulus to arouse the individual.<ref name=Cheyneninenine /> The vestibular nuclei in particular has been identified as being closely related to dreaming during the REM stage of sleep.<ref name=Cheyneninenine /> According to this hypothesis, vestibular-motor disorientation, unlike hallucinations, arise from completely endogenous sources of stimuli.<ref name=Cheynetwothree />
If the effects of sleep “on” neural populations cannot be counteracted, characteristics of REM sleep are retained upon awakening. Common consequences of sleep paralysis include headaches, muscle pains or weakness or paranoia. As the correlation with REM sleep suggests, the paralysis is not complete: use of EOG traces shows that eye movement is still possible during such episodes; however, the individual experiencing sleep paralysis is unable to speak.<ref>Hearne, K. (1990) The Dream Machine: Lucid dreams and how to control them, p18. </ref>
Research has found a genetic component in sleep paralysis.<ref>(Sehgal 2011)</ref> The characteristic fragmentation of REM sleep, hypnopompic, and Hypnagogia hallucinations have a heritable component in other parasomnias, which lends credence to the idea that sleep paralysis is also genetic.<ref name=Sehgal></ref> Twin studies have shown that if one twin of a monozygotic pair (identical twins) experiences sleep paralysis that other twin is very likely to experience it as well.<ref name=Sehgal /> The identification of a genetic component means that there is some sort of disruption of a function at the physiological level. Further studies must be conducted to determine whether there is a mistake in the signaling pathway for arousal as suggested by the first theory presented, or whether the regulation of melatonin or the neural populations themselves have been disrupted.
=== Hallucinations===
Several types of hallucinations have been linked to sleep paralysis: the belief that there is an intruder in the room, the presence of an incubus, and the sensation of floating.<ref name="Cheynetwothree"></ref> A neurological hypothesis is that in sleep paralysis the mechanisms which usually coordinate body movement and provide information on body position become activated and, because there is no actual movement, induce a floating sensation.<ref name=Cheynetwothree />
The intruder and incubus hallucinations highly correlate with one another, and moderately correlated with the third hallucination, vestibular-motor disorientation, also known as out-of-body experiences,<ref name=Cheynetwothree /> which differ from the other two in not involving the threat-activated vigilance system.<ref name=FISP />
=== Threat hyper-vigilance ===
A Hypervigilance state created in the midbrain may further contribute to hallucinations.<ref name="Cheyneninenine" /> More specifically, the emergency response is activated in the brain when individuals wake up paralyzed and feel vulnerable to attack.<ref name="Cheynetwothree" /> This helplessness can intensify the effects of the threat response well above the level typical of normal dreams, which could explain why such visions during sleep paralysis are so vivid.<ref name="Cheynetwothree" /> The threat-activated vigilance system is a protective mechanism that differentiates between dangerous situations and determines whether the fear response is appropriate.<ref name="Cheynetwothree" />
The hyper-vigilance response can lead to the creation of endogenous stimuli that contribute to the perceived threat.<ref name=Cheyneninenine /> A similar process may explain hallucinations, with slight variations, in which an evil presence is perceived by the subject to be attempting to suffocate them, either by pressing heavily on the chest or by strangulation.<ref name=Cheynetwothree /> A neurological explanation holds that this results from a combination of the threat vigilance activation system and the muscle paralysis associated with sleep paralysis that removes voluntary control of breathing.<ref name=Cheynetwothree /> Several features of REM breathing patterns exacerbate the feeling of suffocation.<ref name=Cheynetwothree /> These include shallow rapid breathing, hypercapnia, and slight blockage of the airway, which is a symptom prevalent in sleep apnea patients.<ref name=Cheyneninenine />
According to this account, the subjects attempt to breathe deeply and find themselves unable to do so, creating a sensation of resistance, which the threat-activated vigilance system interprets as an unearthly being sitting on their chest, threatening suffocation.<ref name=Cheyneninenine /> The sensation of entrapment causes a feedback loop when the fear of suffocation increases as a result of continued helplessness, causing the subjects to struggle to end the SP episode.<ref name=Cheynetwothree />
== Diagnosis ==
Sleep paralysis is mainly diagnosed via clinical interview and ruling out other potential sleep disorders that could account for the feelings of paralysis.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=Goldstein /> Several measures are available to reliably diagnose<ref name="FISP" /><ref name=":7"></ref> or screen (Munich Parasomnia Screening)<ref></ref> for recurrent isolated sleep paralysis.
=== Diagnosis ===
Episodes of sleep paralysis can occur in the context of several medical conditions (e.g., narcolepsy, hypokalemia). When episodes occur independent of these conditions or substance use, it is termed "isolated sleep paralysis" (ISP).<ref name=":7" /> When ISP episodes are more frequent and cause clinically significant distress or interference, it is classified as "recurrent isolated sleep paralysis" (RISP). Episodes of sleep paralysis, regardless of classification, are generally short (1–6 minutes), but longer episodes have been documented.<ref name="Cheyneninenine" />
It can be difficult to differentiate between cataplexy brought on by narcolepsy and true sleep paralysis, because the two phenomena are physically indistinguishable. The best way to differentiate between the two is to note when the attacks occur most often. Narcolepsy attacks are more common when the individual is falling asleep; ISP and RISP attacks are more common upon awakening.<ref name=FISP></ref>
===Differential diagnosis===
Similar conditions include:
*Exploding head syndrome (EHS) potentially frightening parasomnia, the hallucinations are usually briefer always loud or jarring and there is no paralysis during EHS.<ref name=Sharp2015></ref>
*Nightmare disorder (ND); also REM-based parasomnia<ref name=Sharp2015/>
*Sleep terrors (STs) potentially frightening parasomnia but are not REM based and there is a lack of awareness to surroundings, characteristic screams during STs.<ref name=Sharp2015/>
*Noctural panic attacks (NPAs) involves fear and acute distress but lacks paralysis and dream imagery<ref name=Sharp2015/>
*Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often includes scary imagery and anxiety but not limited to sleep-wake transitions<ref name=Sharp2015/>
== Prevention ==
Several circumstances have been identified that are associated with an increased risk of sleep paralysis. These include insomnia, sleep deprivation, an erratic sleep schedule, stress, and physical fatigue. It is also believed that there may be a genetic component in the development of RISP, because there is a high concurrent incidence of sleep paralysis in monozygotic twins.<ref name=Sehgal /> Sleeping in the supine position has been found an especially prominent instigator of sleep paralysis.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=Cheynetwotwo></ref>
Sleeping in the supine position is believed to make the sleeper more vulnerable to episodes of sleep paralysis because in this sleeping position it is possible for the soft palate to collapse and obstruct the airway.<ref name=Cheynetwotwo /> This is a possibility regardless of whether the individual has been diagnosed with sleep apnea or not. There may also be a greater rate of microarousals while sleeping in the supine position because there is a greater amount of pressure being exerted on the lungs by gravity.<ref name=Cheynetwotwo />
While many factors can increase the risk for ISP or RISP, they can be avoided with minor lifestyle changes.<ref name=Goldstein />
== Treatment ==
Medical treatment starts with education about sleep stages and the inability to move muscles during REM sleep. People should be evaluated for narcolepsy if symptoms persist.<ref>Wills L, Garcia J. Parasomnias: Epidemiology and Management. CNS Drugs serial online. December 2002;16(12):803–810.</ref> The safest treatment for sleep paralysis is for people to adopt healthier sleeping habits. However, in more serious cases tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be used.<ref name=Med></ref> Despite the fact that these treatments are prescribed there is currently no drug that has been found to completely interrupt episodes of sleep paralysis a majority of the time.<ref name=Med />
=== Medications ===
Though no large trials have taken place which focus on the treatment of sleep paralysis, several drugs have promise in case studies.<ref name=":4"></ref> Two trials of GHB for people with narcolepsy demonstrated reductions in sleep paralysis episodes.<ref name=":4" />
Pimavanserin has been proposed as a possible candidate for future studies in treating sleep paralysis.<ref name = newrev2018></ref>
=== Cognitive-behavior therapy ===
Some of the earliest work in treating sleep paralysis was done using a cognitive-behavior therapy called CA-CBT. The work focuses on psycho-education and modifying catastrophic cognitions about the sleep paralysis attack.<ref></ref><ref></ref> This approach has previously been used to treat sleep paralysis in Egypt, although clinical trials are lacking.<ref></ref>
The first published psychosocial treatment for recurrent isolated sleep paralysis was cognitive-behavior therapy for isolated sleep paralysis (CBT-ISP).<ref name=":7" /> It begins with self-monitoring of symptoms, cognitive restructuring of maladaptive thoughts relevant to ISP (e.g., "the paralysis will be permanent"), and psychoeducation about the nature of sleep paralysis. Prevention techniques include ISP-specific sleep hygiene and the preparatory use of various relaxation techniques (e.g. diaphragmatic breathing, mindfulness, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation). Episode disruption techniques<ref name=":5"></ref> are first practiced in session and then applied during actual attacks. No controlled trial of CBT-ISP has yet been conducted to prove its effectiveness.
== Epidemiology ==
Sleep paralysis is experienced equally in males and females.<ref name=Bri2011 /><ref name=Dauvilliers></ref> Lifetime prevalence rates derived from 35 aggregated studies indicate that approximately 8% of the general population, 28% of students, and 32% of psychiatric patients experience at least one episode of sleep paralysis at some point in their lives.<ref name=Bri2011 /> Rates of recurrent sleep paralysis are not as well known, but 15%-45% of those with a lifetime history of sleep paralysis may meet diagnostic criteria for Recurrent Isolated Sleep Paralysis.<ref name="FISP" /><ref name=":0" /> In surveys from Canada, China, England, Japan and Nigeria, 20% to 60% of individuals reported having experienced sleep paralysis at least once in their lifetime.<ref name=Blackmore2002></ref> In general, non-whites appear to experience sleep paralysis at higher rates than whites, but the magnitude of the difference is rather small.<ref name=Bri2011 /> Approximately 36% of the general population that experiences isolated sleep paralysis is likely to develop it between 25 and 44 years of age.<ref name=Ohayon></ref>
Isolated sleep paralysis is commonly seen in patients that have been diagnosed with narcolepsy. Approximately 30–50% of people that have been diagnosed with narcolepsy have experienced sleep paralysis as an auxiliary symptom.<ref name=Ohayon /> A majority of the individuals who have experienced sleep paralysis have sporadic episodes that occur once a month to once a year. Only 3% of individuals experiencing sleep paralysis that is not associated with a neuromuscular disorder have nightly episodes.<ref name=Ohayon />
Sleep paralysis is more frequent in students and psychiatric patients.<ref name=Bri2011/>
== Society and culture ==
=== Etymology ===
The original definition of sleep paralysis was codified by Samuel Johnson in his A Dictionary of the English Language as nightmare, a term that evolved into our modern definition. The term was first used and dubbed by British neurologist, S.A.K. Wilson in his 1928 dissertation, The Narcolepsies.<ref>Wilson S. A. K. (1928). The narcolepsies. Brain 51 63–109. 10.1093/brain/51.1.63</ref> Such sleep paralysis was widely considered the work of demons, and more specifically incubi, which were thought to sit on the chests of sleepers. In Old English the name for these beings was mare or mære (from a proto-Germanic *marōn, cf. Old Norse mara), hence comes the mare in the word nightmare. The word might be cognate to Greek Marōn (in the Odyssey) and Sanskrit Māra.
=== Cultural significance and priming ===
 haunting.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Cheynetwothree" />
According to some scientists culture may be a major factor in shaping sleep paralysis.<ref name=":6"></ref> When sleep paralysis is interpreted through a particular cultural filter, it may take on greater salience. For example, if sleep paralysis is feared in a certain culture, this fear could lead to conditioned fear, and thus worsen the experience, in turn leading to higher rates.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":6" /> Consistent with this idea, high rates and long durations of immobility during sleep paralysis have been found in Egypt, where there are elaborate beliefs about sleep paralysis, involving malevolent spirit-like creatures, the jinn.<ref name=":6" />
Research has found that sleep paralysis is associated with great fear and fear of impending death in 50% of sufferers in Egypt.<ref name=":6" /> A study comparing rates and characteristics of sleep paralysis in Egypt and Denmark found that the phenomenon is three times more common in Egypt versus Denmark.<ref name=":6" /> In Denmark, unlike Egypt, there are no elaborate supernatural beliefs about sleep paralysis, and the experience is often interpreted as an odd physiological event, with overall shorter sleep paralysis episodes and fewer people (17%) fearing that they could die from it.<ref name=":2" />
=== Folklore ===
The night hag is a generic name for a folkloric creature found in cultures around the world, and which is used to explain the phenomenon of sleep paralysis. A common description is that a person feels a presence of a supernatural malevolent being which immobilizes the person as if standing on the chest.<ref>Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art, Volume 1, edited by Thomas A. Green, urltoken p. 588 </ref> This phenomenon goes by many names.
==== Egypt ====
In Egypt, sleep paralysis is conceptualized as a terrifying jinn attack. The jinn may even kill its victims.<ref name=":2" />
==== Cambodia ====
Sleep paralysis among Cambodians is known as “the ghost pushes you down,”<ref name=":3" /> and entails the belief in dangerous visitations from deceased relatives.<ref name=":3" />
==== Italy ====
In the different regions of Italy there are many examples of supernatural beings associated with sleep paralysis. In the regions of Marche and Abruzzo, it is referred to as a Pandafeche attack;<ref name=":1" /> the Pandafeche usually refers to an evil witch, sometimes a ghostlike spirit or a terrifying catlike creature, that mounts on the chest of the victim and tries to harm him. The only way to avoid her is to keep a bag of sand or beans close to the bed, so that the witch will stop to count how many beans or sand-grains are inside it. A similar tradition is present in the Sardinian folklore, where the Ammuntadore is known as a creature that mounts on the people's chest during their sleep to give them nightmares, and that can change its shape according to the person's fears. In Northern Italy, specifically in the Tyrol area, the Trud is a witch that sits on the people's chest at night, making them unable to breath; to chase her away, people should make the Sign of the cross, something that would need a great struggle in a situation of paralysis.<ref></ref> In Southern Italy, sleep paralysis is usually explained with the presence of a sprite standing on the people's chest: if the person manages to catch the sprite (or steal his hat), in exchange for his freedom (or to have his hat back) he can reveal the hiding place of a rich treasure; this sprite has different names in different regions of Italy: Monaciello in Campania, Monachicchio in Basilicata, Laurieddhu or Scazzamurill in Apulia, Mazzmuredd in Molise.<ref></ref>
==== Newfoundland ====
In Newfoundland, sleep paralysis is referred to as the Old Hag,<ref name=":8" /><ref></ref> and victims of a hagging are said to be hag-ridden upon awakening.<ref></ref> Victims report being completely conscious, but unable to speak or move, and report a person or an animal which sits upon their chest.<ref name=":9"></ref> Despite the name, the attacker can be either male or female.<ref></ref> Some suggested cures or preventions for the Old Hag include sleeping with a Bible under the pillow,<ref name=":9" /> calling the sleeper's name backwards<ref></ref> or in an extreme example, sleeping with a shingle or board embedded with nails strapped to the chest.<ref></ref> This object was called a Hag Board.<ref></ref> The Old Hag is well-enough known in the province to be a pop culture figure, appearing in films and plays<ref></ref> as well as in crafted objects.<ref></ref>
==== United States ====
Sleep paralysis is sometimes interpreted as space alien abduction in the United States.<ref></ref>
=== Literature ===
Various forms of magic and spiritual possession were also advanced as causes in literature. In nineteenth century Europe, the vagaries of diet were thought to be responsible. For example, in Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, Ebenezer Scrooge attributes the ghost he sees to ". an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato." In a similar vein, the Household Cyclopedia (1881) offers the following advice about nightmares:
:"Great attention is to be paid to regularity and choice of diet. Intemperance of every kind is hurtful, but nothing is more productive of this disease than drinking bad wine. Of eatables those which are most prejudicial are all fat and greasy meats and pastry. Moderate exercise contributes in a superior degree to promote the digestion of food and prevent flatulence; those, however, who are necessarily confined to a sedentary occupation, should particularly avoid applying themselves to study or bodily labor immediately after eating. Going to bed before the usual hour is a frequent cause of night-mare, as it either occasions the patient to sleep too long or to lie long awake in the night. Passing a whole night or part of a night without rest likewise gives birth to the disease, as it occasions the patient, on the succeeding night, to sleep too soundly. Indulging in sleep too late in the morning, is an almost certain method to bring on the paroxysm, and the more frequently it returns, the greater strength it acquires; the propensity to sleep at this time is almost irresistible."<ref></ref>
J. M. Barrie, the author of the Peter Pan stories, may have had sleep paralysis. He said of himself ‘In my early boyhood it was a sheet that tried to choke me in the night.’<ref></ref> He also described several incidents in the Peter Pan stories that indicate that he was familiar with an awareness of a loss of muscle tone whilst in a dream-like state. For example, Maimie is asleep but calls out ‘What was that.It is coming nearer! It is feeling your bed with its horns-it is boring for into you’.<ref></ref> and when the Darling children were dreaming of flying, Barrie says ‘Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet their progress had become slow and laboured, exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces. Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists.’<ref></ref> Barrie describes many parasomnias and neurological symptoms in his books and uses them to explore the nature of consciousness from an experiential point of view.<ref></ref>
=== Documentary films ===
The Nightmare is a 2015 documentary that discusses the causes of sleep paralysis as seen through extensive interviews with participants, and the experiences are re-enacted by professional actors. In synopsis, it proposes that such cultural phenomena as alien abduction, Near-death experience and shadow person can, in many cases, be attributed to sleep paralysis. The "real-life" horror film debuted at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2015 and premiered in theatres on June 5, 2015.<ref></ref>

Sleep paralysis is a state, hypnopompic or hypnagogic, in which a person is aware but unable to move or speak.<ref name=Sharp2016></ref><ref name=Av2011></ref> During an episode, one may hallucinate (hear, feel, or see things that are not there), which often results in fear.<ref name=Sharp2016/> Episodes generally last less than a couple of minutes.<ref name=Av2011/> It may occur as a single episode or be recurrent.<ref name=Sharp2016/>
The condition may occur in those who are otherwise healthy or those with narcolepsy, or it may run in families as a result of specific genetic changes.<ref name=Av2011/> The condition can be triggered by sleep deprivation, psychological stress, or abnormal sleep cycles.<ref name=Av2011/> The underlying mechanism is believed to involve a dysfunction in REM sleep.<ref name=Av2011/> Sleep paralysis is commonly experienced by lucid dreamers; some lucid dreamers use this as a method of having a lucid dream.<ref></ref> Diagnosis is based on a person's description.<ref name=Av2011/> Other conditions that can present similarly include narcolepsy, atonic seizure, and hypokalemic periodic paralysis.<ref name=Av2011/>
Treatment options for sleep paralysis have been poorly studied.<ref name=Sharp2016/> It is recommended that people be reassured that the condition is common and generally not serious.<ref name=Sharp2016/> Other efforts that may be tried include sleep hygiene, cognitive behavioral therapy, and antidepressants.<ref name=Sharp2016/>
Between 8% and 50% of people experience sleep paralysis at some point in their life.<ref name=Av2011 /><ref name=Bri2011></ref> About 5% of people have regular episodes.<ref name=Av2011/> Males and females are affected equally.<ref name=Av2011/> Sleep paralysis has been described throughout history.<ref name=Sharp2016/> It is believed to have played a role in the creation of stories about alien abduction and other paranormal events.<ref name=Sharp2016/>
