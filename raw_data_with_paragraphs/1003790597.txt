Mormonism and polygamy

==Origin==
Many early converts to the religion including Brigham Young,<ref name="JournalHist1857">Journal History, 26 August 1857; cited by Hyrum Leslie Andrus, Doctrines of the Kingdom (Salt Lake City, Utah: Desert Book Co., 1999), 489n436 </ref> Orson Pratt, and Lyman Johnson, recorded that Joseph Smith was teaching plural marriage privately as early as 1831 or 1832. Pratt reported that Smith told some early members in 1831 and 1832 that plural marriage was a true principle, but that the time to practice it had not yet come.<ref name="OrsonPratt">Orson Pratt, " urltoken Celestial Marriage," Journal of Discourses, reported by David W. Evans (7 October 1869), Vol. 13 (London: Latter-day Saint's Book Depot, 1871), 192–93.</ref> Johnson also claimed to have heard the doctrine from Smith in 1831.<ref name="LymanJohnson">Lyman Johnson as recounted by Orson Pratt, " urltoken Report of Elders Orson Pratt and Joseph F. Smith," Millennial Star, vol. 40, no. 50 (16 December 1878): 788.</ref> Mosiah Hancock reported that his father was taught about plural marriage in the spring of 1832.<ref name="MosiahHancock">Todd M. Compton, In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1997), 644; citing Mosiah Hancock Autobiography, 61–62.</ref>
The 1835 and 1844 versions of the church's Doctrine and Covenants (D&C) prohibited polygamy and declared that monogamy was the only acceptable form of marriage:
William Clayton, Smith's scribe, recorded early polygamous marriages in 1843: "On the 1st day of May, 1843, I officiated in the office of an Elder by marrying Lucy Walker to the Prophet Joseph Smith, at his own residence. During this period the Prophet Joseph took several other wives. Amongst the number I well remember Eliza Partridge, Emily Partridge, Sarah Ann Whitney, Helen Kimball and Flora Woodworth. These all, he acknowledged to me, were his lawful, wedded wives, according to the celestial order. His wife Emma was cognizant of the fact of some, if not all, of these being his wives, and she generally treated them very kindly."<ref></ref>
As early as 1832, Mormon missionaries worked successfully to convert followers in Maine of polygamist religious leader Jacob Cochran, who went into hiding in 1830 to escape imprisonment due to his practice of polygamy. Among Cochran's marital innovations was "spiritual wifery," and "tradition assumes that he received frequent consignments of spiritual consorts, and that such were invariably the most robust and attractive women in the community."<ref> urltoken Ridlon, G.T. Cochran Delusion/Mormon Invasion, in Saco Valley Settlements and Families: Historical, Biographical, Genealogical, Traditional, and Legendary (Rutland, Vermont: Charles E. Tuttle, 1895), 269 ff.</ref> The majority of what became the Quorum of the Twelve in 1835 attended Mormon conferences held in the center of the Cochranites in 1834 and 1835.<ref>Evening and Morning Star 2 August 1834: 181.</ref><ref>Messenger and Advocate 2 October 1835: 204–07 states that "On August 21, 1835, nine of the Twelve met in conference at Saco, Maine."</ref><ref>History of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints 1:583.</ref><ref>History of the Church 2:252</ref> Brigham Young, an apostle of the church, became acquainted with Cochran's followers as he made several missionary journeys through the Cochranite territory from Boston to Saco,<ref>Times and Seasons 6 November 1, 1845.</ref> and later married Augusta Adams Cobb, a former Cochranite.<ref>Stewart, J. J. (1961) Brigham Young and His Wives, at p. 85.</ref><ref>Carter, K.B. (1973) Our pioneer heritage 6, 187–89.</ref>
Joseph Smith publicly condemned polygamy, denied his involvement in it, and participants were excommunicated, as church records and publications reflect.<ref>"Notice," Times and Seasons, Volume 5, No. 3, 1 February 1844 (p. 423 in urltoken bound edition — urltoken alt source of text) "As we have lately been credibly informed, that an Elder of the Church of Jesus Christ, of Latter-day Saints, by the name of Hiram Brown, has been preaching Polygamy, and other false and corrupt doctrines, in the county of Lapeer, state of Michigan."</ref><ref></ref> But church leaders nevertheless began practicing polygamy in the 1840s, particularly members of the Quorum of the Twelve.<ref>Smith, W. "A Proclamation," Warsaw Signal, Warsaw, Illinois October 1845, page 1, column 4</ref> Sidney Rigdon, while he was estranged from the church, wrote a letter in backlash to the Messenger and Advocate in 1844 condemning the church's Quorum of the Twelve and their alleged connection to polygamy:
On another occasion, he said "You are sent out as shepherds to gather sheep together; and remember that they are not your sheep . do not make selections before they are brought home and put into the fold."<ref></ref>
The first quote above is not attested in any Mormon source, but first appeared in a derisive article in the New York Times on May 15, 1860.<ref>Hirshson's cited source of the first quote is an April 17, 1860 New York Times article: </ref> FairMormon, an LDS apologetics organization, considers the "prettiest women" statement to be apocryphal, but that it may be a paraphrase of Kimball's Journal of Discourses statement, which is authentic.<ref></ref>
In the paragraph immediately following the above quote, Kimball said:
The precise number who participated in plural marriage is not known, but studies indicate a maximum of 20 to 25 percent of Latter-day Saint adults were members of polygamist households. One third of the women of marriageable age and nearly all of the church leadership were involved in the practice.<ref>Encyclopedia of Mormonism. Macmillan (1992) p. 1095.</ref>
===Instances of coercion===
Critics of polygamy in the early LDS Church have documented several cases where deception and coercion were used to induce marriage,<ref></ref> for example citing the case of Joseph Smith who warned some potential spouses of eternal damnation if they did not consent to be his wife.<ref name="Harvnb|Compton|1997"/> In 1893, married LDS Church member John D. Miles traveled to England and proposed to Caroline Owens, assuring her that he was not polygamous. She returned to Utah and participated in a wedding, only to find out after the ceremony that Miles was already married. She ran away, but Miles hunted her down and raped her. She eventually escaped, and filed a lawsuit against Miles that reached the Supreme Court and became a significant case in polygamy case law.<ref></ref> Ann Eliza Young, nineteenth wife of Brigham Young, claimed that Young coerced her to marry him by threatening financial ruin of her brother.<ref></ref>
===Incestuous plural marriages===
Critics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that polygamy was used to justify marriage of close relatives that would otherwise be considered immoral.<ref name="Abanes 2003 pp=297"/><ref></ref> In 1843, Joseph Smith's diary records the sealing of John Milton Bernhisel to his sister, Maria, in a ceremony that included the sealing of Bernhisel to multiple relatives, some of whom were deceased.<ref></ref> However, this is understood by most scholars as the collective sealing or binding of the family and not a marriage between Bernhisel and his sister. Similar family sealings are practiced in Latter-Day Saint temples today, where children of parents who were not sealed at the time of their marriage are sealed to their parents and to one another in a group ceremony.

Polygamy (called plural marriage by Mormons in the 19th century or the Principle by modern fundamentalist practitioners of polygamy) was practiced by leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) for more than half of the 19th century,<ref name=LDSofficialstatement></ref> and practiced publicly from 1852 to 1890 by between 20 and 30 percent of Latter-day Saint families.<ref></ref><ref name=Embry1994></ref> Today, various denominations of fundamentalist Mormonism continue to practice polygamy.<ref></ref>
The Latter-day Saints' practice of polygamy has been controversial, both within Western society and the LDS Church itself. The U.S. was both fascinated and horrified by the practice of polygamy, with the Republican platform at one time referencing "the twin relics of barbarism—polygamy and slavery."<ref> urltoken US History.org website</ref> The private practice of polygamy was instituted in the 1830s by founder Joseph Smith. The public practice of plural marriage by the church was announced and defended in 1852 by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Orson Pratt,<ref name=Embry1994 /> by the request of church president Brigham Young.
For over 60 years, the LDS Church and the United States were at odds over the issue: the church defended the practice as a matter of religious freedom, while the federal government aggressively sought to eradicate it, consistent with prevailing public opinion. Polygamy was probably a significant factor in the Utah War of 1857 and 1858, given Republican attempts to paint Democratic President James Buchanan as weak in his opposition to both polygamy and slavery. In 1862, the United States Congress passed the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, which prohibited plural marriage in the territories.<ref name=Embry1994 /> In spite of the law, Mormons continued to practice polygamy, believing that it was protected by the First Amendment. In 1879, in Reynolds v. United States,<ref>Reynolds v. United States urltoken “The History of The Supreme Court”</ref> the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the Morrill Act, stating: "Laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinion, they may with practices."<ref name=Embry1994 />
In 1890, when it became clear that Utah would not be admitted to the Union while polygamy was still practiced, church president Wilford Woodruff issued a Manifesto that officially terminated the practice of polygamy.<ref></ref> Although this Manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. After the Manifesto, some Mormons continued to enter into polygamous marriages, but these eventually stopped in 1904 when church president Joseph F. Smith disavowed polygamy before Congress and issued a "Second Manifesto," calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease, and established excommunication as the consequence for those who disobeyed. Several small "fundamentalist" groups, seeking to continue the practice, split from the LDS Church, including the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB) and the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church). Meanwhile, the LDS Church continues its policy of excommunicating members found practicing polygamy, and today actively seeks to distance itself from fundamentalist groups that continue the practice.<ref>The LDS Church encourages journalists not to use the word "Mormon" in reference to organizations or people that practice polygamy ; the church repudiates polygamist groups and excommunicates their members if discovered ; </ref> On its web site, the church states that "the standard doctrine of the church is monogamy" and that polygamy was a temporary exception to the rule.<ref name=LDSofficialstatement /><ref>Citing Jacob, chapter 2, from the Book of Mormon: "Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none . . For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things."</ref>
