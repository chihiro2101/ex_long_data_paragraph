Bandidos Motorcycle Club

==History==
The Bandidos Motorcycle Club was founded by 36-year-old dockworker Donald Eugene Chambers on March 4, 1966, in San Leon, Texas.<ref name=TexMonthly> urltoken Texas Monthly: "The Gang’s All Here" by Skip Hollansworth APRIL 2007</ref> Chambers named the club in honor of the Mexican bandits who lived by their own rules, and he recruited members from biker bars locally in Houston as well as in Corpus Christi, Galveston, and San Antonio.<ref name=TexMonthly /> Like other outlaw motorcycle clubs, they call themselves "one percenters", a phrase coined by the former president of the American Motorcyclist Association who once stated that 99 percent of motorcyclists were law-abiding citizens and 1 percent "outlaws."<ref name=TexMonthly /> By the early 1970s, the club had over one hundred members, including many Vietnam War veterans.<ref name=TexMonthly />
Ronald Jerome "Ronnie" Hodge took over from Chambers as the Bandidos' president in 1972. Hodge was nicknamed "Mr. Prospect" because of the short amount of time in which he was awarded his club membership, and he later became known as "Step Mother" in deference to Chambers' moniker "Mother".<ref> urltoken History BandidosMC.eu</ref> Under Hodge's leadership, the Bandidos became an international motorcycle club when the first foreign chapter was established in Sydney, Australia in 1983. The Australian branch was founded by Anthony Mark "Snodgrass" Spencer, who had previously encountered Bandidos members during a visit to the United States.<ref> urltoken Milperra - the spark that started the bikie violence Paul Kent, The Daily Telegraph (11 April 2009)</ref> Ronnie Hodge was sentenced to five years in prison in December 1988 for conspiring to bomb homes and automobiles belonging to members of a rival club, and he died of heart disease in 1992.<ref> urltoken Explosives Incidents Report Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (1988)</ref><ref name=TexMonthly />

The Bandidos' insignia, known as the "Fat Mexican", consists of a caricature of a Mexican bandit wearing a sombrero and holding a sword in one hand and a pistol in the other.<ref> urltoken Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs: Aspects of the One-Percenter Culture for Emergency Department Personnel to Consider Anand N.

These patches consist of red lettering displayed on a gold background. The Bandidos' colors were inspired by those of the United States Marine Corps and chosen by Chambers, a Marine Corps veteran of the Vietnam War.<ref name="Bandidos: 5 things to know about second-most dangerous motorcycle gang"/> Patches denoting a member's rank and chapter are worn, as are various other patches which have specific meanings. Although the particular meaning of each patch is not publicly known, various law enforcement agencies have identified Bandidos patches which they believe are related to criminal activity.<ref> urltoken Ein Bandido packt aus Melanie Pothman, Westfälische Rundschau (6 November 2009)</ref> For example, police have reported that the "Expect No Mercy" patch is awarded to those who have committed murder on behalf of the club, while the "TCB" ("Taking Care of Business") patch is worn by club officers and nomads. Similar to the "Expect No Mercy" patch, the "CDG" ("Coup de Grâce") patch reportedly signifies a member who has committed a significant act of violence.<ref> urltoken Polisen: Det betyder märkena på Bandidosvästarna Sandra Divinyi, Göteborgs-Posten (17 June 2016)</ref>

==Membership==
Bandidos members must be male<ref> urltoken Can Women Join Motorcycle Clubs?

The length of this process is decided by each chapter president, and ends when the chapter's members vote unanimously to allow the probationary member to enter the club. A screening process is carried out to prevent infiltration by law enforcement. Upon joining the Bandidos, each member must sign their motorcycle over to the club.<ref name="20 Rules The Bandidos Make Their Members Follow"/>
Each club chapter follows a structured hierarchy, with a president, vice-president, sergeant-at-arms, road captain and secretary/treasurer. Members must abide by various by-laws, such as not wearing the club patch while riding in a car or truck, and are required to attend meetings (known as "Church") four times per month.<ref name="The Infamous ‘One Percenters’: A Review of the Criminality, Subculture, and Structure of Modern Biker Gangs"> urltoken The Infamous ‘One Percenters’: A Review of the Criminality, Subculture, and Structure of Modern Biker Gangs Danielle Shields (2012)</ref> These rules also dictate that any member who fails to attend mandatory group motorcycle rides is fined and must forfeit the title of his motorcycle.<ref> urltoken Federal indictment details life, self-law of Bandidos Dane Schiller, Houston Chronicle (January 7, 2016)</ref> Another requirement is that Bandidos must follow the philosophy "All members are your brothers and your family", and must "not fear authority and have a general disdain for the rules of society". Any member who cooperates with law enforcement, for example, is susceptible to disciplinary action. All Bandidos regalia, including tattoos, is considered club property. Membership fees are required, and are used to cover club expenses, such as funeral costs, and contribute to a legal defense fund.<ref name="20 Rules The Bandidos Make Their Members Follow"/> Club bylaws state that any member who commits suicide will not receive a Bandidos funeral.<ref> urltoken The Fat Mexican Alex Caine (2009)</ref>
The Bandidos have an estimated membership of between 2,000 and 2,500 worldwide.<ref name="Bandidos: 5 things to know about second-most dangerous motorcycle gang"/> In the United States, the majority of the club consists of white and Hispanic males.<ref name=TexMonthly />
==Organization==
The Bandidos Motorcycle Club is organized by local chapters, with state and regional officers, as well as a national chapter made up of four regional vice-presidents and a national president. The leadership of the club consists of an international president, known as "El Presidente", who has authority over every club chapter.<ref name="The Infamous ‘One Percenters’: A Review of the Criminality, Subculture, and Structure of Modern Biker Gangs"/> The club also has nomad chapters, made up of members not bound by geographical location, which are responsible for security, counterintelligence and internal discipline.<ref name="The Infamous ‘One Percenters’: A Review of the Criminality, Subculture, and Structure of Modern Biker Gangs"/><ref> urltoken Into The Abyss: A Personal Journey into the World of Street Gangs Mike Carlie, Missouri State University (2002)</ref> The Bandidos' "mother chapter" is based in Houston, Texas.<ref> urltoken Bandidos Motorcycle Club bandidosmcunitedstates.com</ref>

The Bandidos expanded into Canada following a merger with the Rock Machine in Quebec in 2000. After establishing further chapters in Ontario, Alberta and Manitoba, the club's operations in Canada ceased in November 2007 as a result of infighting, law enforcement efforts, and pulled status from the club's American leadership.<ref> urltoken Hells Angels under pressure as outlaw motorcycle clubs from across the globe expand into Canada Adrian Humphreys, National Post (6 June 2015)</ref>

The United States Department of Justice and Europol consider the Bandidos to be a criminal organization.<ref name="doj-gangunit">
 
</ref><ref name="Outlaw motorcycle gangs"/> The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Criminal Intelligence Service Canada (CISC) also identify the club as one of the "big four" motorcycle gangs, along with the Hells Angels, Outlaws and Pagans, and contend that the club is responsible for organized crime activity such as drug dealing, arms trafficking, prostitution, extortion, money laundering and murder.<ref> urltoken FBI 2013 National Gang Intelligence Center report fbi.gov (2013)</ref><ref name="2005 National Gang Threat Assessment"/><ref> urltoken 2004 Annual Report - Criminal Intelligence Service Canada, cisc.gc.ca</ref>
While individual chapters had been banned previously, the Netherlands became the first country to prohibit the club as a whole in December 2017 when a court in Utrecht outlawed both the Dutch department of the Bandidos and the international organization on the grounds that the club forms a threat to public order.<ref> urltoken Dutch court bans motorcycle gang Bandidos Janene Pieters, NL Times (20 December 2017)</ref>
