Alexis Herman

===Secretary of Labor===
In 1996, President Clinton announced his intention to nominate Herman as Secretary of Labor to replace outgoing Secretary Robert Reich.<ref name="Silverstein, Stuart, A Power Behind" /><ref name="Merida, Kevin, After Pitched Battle" /> trade unions publicly supported the nomination, although they had mostly supported other potential nominees such as Harris Wofford, Esteban Edward Torres, and Alan Wheat.<ref name="Merida, Kevin, After Pitched Battle" /> Herman's Senate confirmation was delayed twice. The first resulted from questions regarding her role in organizing White House coffees Clinton used as fundraisers. The second was because Senate Republicans refused to allow a vote on her nomination, as part of their opposition to a proposed executive order related to federal construction projects, which Clinton eventually abandoned.<ref></ref><ref></ref> With the delays over, the Senate Labor Committee held its hearing on her nomination on March 18, 1997.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Then on April 30, 1997, the Senate voted to confirm by a vote of 85–13.<ref></ref> Herman was sworn in on May 9, 1997.<ref name="ClintonWhitehouse" /> She became the first African-American, and the fifth woman, to serve in the position.<ref name="ClintonWhitehouse" /><ref></ref>
As Secretary of Labor, Herman oversaw the Department of Labor, which at the time employed 17,000 people and operated on a $39 billion annual budget.<ref></ref> The Department of Labor is tasked with enforcing a variety of workplace laws and regulations, including safety issues and anti-discrimination.<ref name="Taylor, T.

As secretary, Herman supported the 1996 and 1997 raises to the minimum wage, increasing it by $0.90 to $5.15 per hour by September 1997.<ref></ref><ref name="Minimum wage jumps"></ref> Herman argued the wage hike increased the buying power of workers.<ref name="Minimum wage jumps" /> She later opposed a 1999 Republican supported plan to raise the minimum wage over three years, instead supporting a two-year time-table for an increase.<ref name="2 in Cabinet Push" /> Herman also opposed the legislation as it included tax cuts without offsets.<ref></ref><ref name="2 in Cabinet Push"></ref>
Among Herman's responsibilities as secretary was the enforcement of Child labour law.<ref name="Taylor, T.

Herman supported the United States' participation in the International Labour Organization Child Labor Convention, a treaty designed to protect children under 18 years old from slavery, trafficking, bondage, and other abuses.<ref></ref> She also defended the United States' support of a provision to allow for voluntary military service of those under 18 years old, a practice allowed in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name="Another Cabinet Member Cleared" /> Opponents, including other nations, trade unions, and Amnesty International urged tougher provisions; however, Herman contended the focus of the treaty should be on forced labor, not voluntary military service.<ref></ref>
Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Independent Council Ralph I. Lancaster Jr., in May 1998, to investigate Herman after businessman Laurent J. Yene alleged she accepted kickbacks while working at the White House.<ref name="Another Cabinet Member Cleared"></ref><ref></ref><ref name="Jackson, Robert L., Labor Secretary Cleared"></ref> Reno was skeptical of Yene's allegations following a preliminary FBI investigation, but she believed the Independent Council law obligated her to appoint independent council where she could not affirm the claims were without merit.<ref name="Jackson, Robert L., Labor Secretary Cleared" /> Following a twenty-three month investigation, Independent Council Lancaster concluded that Herman had broken no laws and cleared her of all wrongdoing.<ref></ref><ref name="Another Cabinet Member Cleared" /> She was the fifth Clinton cabinet officer to be investigated by independent counsel, and the fourth cleared of all wrongdoing.<ref name="Another Cabinet Member Cleared" /><ref name="Jackson, Robert L., Labor Secretary Cleared" /> The Independent Council investigations of the cabinet members cost $95 million and did not uncover any felonies, leading Congress to allow the Independent Counsel Act to expire in June 1999 without re-authorization.<ref name="Jackson, Robert L., Labor Secretary Cleared" />
