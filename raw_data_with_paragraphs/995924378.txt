Tyrtaeus

==Life==
=== Sources ===
Virtually all we know about the life of Tyrtaeus is found two entries of the Suda, a Byzantine encyclopedia redacted in the 10th century AD. Traditional accounts of his life were almost entirely deduced from his poetry or were simply fiction, such as the account by Pausanias of his supposed transformation from a lame and stupid school teacher in Athens to the mastermind of Spartan victories against the Messenians.<ref name="Paus-4.15.6">Pausanias urltoken 4.15.6, cited by .</ref> Variations on his Athenian origin and deformity are found in numerous ancient sources, including Diogenes Laërtius, who said that the Athenians regarded him as deranged,<ref>Diogenes Laërtius 2.43, cited by .</ref> Porphyry, who labelled him "one-eyed",<ref>Porphyry in Horace A.P. 402, cited by .</ref> or Justin, who believed that he was sent to the Spartans by the Athenians as a deliberate insult.<ref>Justin 3.5, cited by .</ref> (640–637 BC). He wrote a constitution for the Lacedaemonians, precepts in elegiac verse, and war songs, in five books.<ref name="suda">Suda urltoken iv.610.5 (Adler), cited by .</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}
The second entry states that the Spartans took him as their general from among the Athenians in response to an oracle.
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the picture of Tyrtaeus' life has been complicated by doubts about the authenticity of many of his verses, dated by various scholars to the 5th or 4th century BC. A theory that "Tyrtaeus" was in fact a 5th century Athenian was even posited by Eduard Schwartz in 1899.<ref>E. Schwartz, "Tyrtaios", Hermes 34 (1899), cited by .</ref><ref>See also Macan in Classical Review (February 1897); H. Weil, Études sur l'antiquité grecque (1900), and C. Giarratani, Tirteo e i suoi carmi (1905).</ref> According to Gerber (1997), however, "that skepticism has now largely disappeared", and disagreements among scholars now essentially revolves around the version of fragment 4 that should be accepted as genuine (Plutarch's or Diodorus' version, or a combination of the two), and about the dating of fragment 12, which some critics have assigned to the time of Xenophanes (c. 570 – c. 475 BC) or shortly before 498 BC.<ref>, Gerber states that "most critics have been convinced" by Jaeger's defence of fr. 12 as Tyrtaeus' work (Five Essays. 1966 1932. pp. 103–42), but that Fränkel (EGPP. pp. 337–39) assigns it "to the time of Xenophanes" and G. Tarditi ("Parenesi e arete nel corpus tirtaico". 1982. RFIC 110. pp. 257–276) to shortly before Pindar's Pythian 10 (498).</ref>
=== Birth and place of origin ===
The floruit given in the first entry of Suda is perhaps too early since Jerome offers a date of 633–632. Modern scholars are less specific and provide instead date ranges for the Second Messenian War (and thus for Tyrtaeus' life) such as "the latter part of the 7th century",<ref>V. Parker, 'The Dates of the Messenian Wars', Chiron 21 (1991), pages 25–47, as summarized by .</ref> or "any time between the sixties and the thirties" of the 7th century.
The confusion about his place of origin, which emerged by the 5th century BC,<ref></ref> may have had several causes. It has been suggested that the depictions of Tyrtaeus as a lame schoolmaster from Athens were invented to denigrate Sparta, which in the views of Athenians could not have had a talented poet of its own. According to Pausanias, the Athenians sent the lame, mentally defective teacher-poet to Sparta as a compromise, wishing to obey the oracle which had demanded an Athenian, but unwilling to help the Spartans in their war with a more capable individual.<ref name="Paus-4.15.6" /> Yet, Tyrtaeus was not listed by Herodotus among the two foreigners ever to have been awarded Spartan citizenship.<ref>Herodotus ix. 35.</ref> One ancient source even listed Aphidnae as his supposed Athenian deme, but there was also a place of that name in Laconia. 
Ancient Athenian propaganda might indeed have played a role, although even Plato, who could hardly have intended any denigration as an admirer of Sparta, gave credence to the poet's Athenian origin.<ref>Plato Laws urltoken 1.629a–b, cited by .</ref> According to scholar N. R. E. Fisher, "the story was surely an invention by Athenians, designed in the first instance for a predominantly Athenian market. It must have been aimed at making co-operation between Sparta and Athens more acceptable". It has also been noted that Tyrtaeus did not compose in the vernacular Laconian Doric Greek of Sparta, as could be expected of a native Spartan like his near contemporary Alcman. However, Greek elegists used the Ionic Greek of Homer regardless of their city of origin or their audience.
Scholars generally agree that Tyrtaeus was a native of Laconia for several reasons: the use of the first personal plural to include himself among the Heraclidae whom Zeus had given to Sparta in fragment 2; the presence of occasional Doric words in his vocabulary; and his tone of authority when addressing Spartan warriors, which would have been tolerated only if delivered by a Spartan-born poet.
===Sparta===
The conquest of Messenia in the eighth century, by the grandfathers of Tyrtaeus's generation, provided the foundation for a sophisticated and cultivated lifestyle. Foreign poets like the Lesbian Terpander and Cretan Thaletas were welcome guests. Ivory and gold ornaments, bronze vessels of ornate workmanship, fine pottery and the odes of Alcman all testify to refined tastes, continuing even into the sixth century. The continuance of those luxuries was "dearly purchased" in blood and toil by Tyrtaeus's generation when the Messenians revolted, and the ensuing war and civil strife inspired his entire poetic work. The crisis was mentioned by Aristotle for its instructive power:
The noble sentiment of line 1 seems to be original yet the vocabulary is entirely Homeric and, though lines 5–7 are adapted from Homer's Iliad (13.130–33),<ref group="nb">".locking spear by spear, shield against shield at the base, so buckler/ leaned on buckler, helmet on helmet, man against man, and the horse-hair crests along the horns of their shining helmets/ touched as they bent their heads, so dense were they formed on each other,." Iliad 13.130–33, translated by R.Lattimore, The Iliad of Homer, University of Chicago Press (1951)</ref> there is an important difference: Homer describes the advance of one side in close formation, whereas Tyrtaeus describes two sides meeting in the hoplite style of fighting. The description of the battle is rejected however by some scholars as anachronistic: for example, missiles were not characteristic of hoplite warfare. The passage demonstrates one of the more common devices employed by Tyrtaeus—the use of parallel phrases for amplification, sometimes degenerating into tedious repetition. Here it is used to communicate a sense of the crowded battlefield.
==Editions and translations==
There are English verse translations by Richard Polwhele (1792) and imitations by the English poet laureate H. J. Pye (1795), and an Italian version by F. Cavallotti, with text, introduction and notes (1898). The fragment that begins with (fr. 10 West) has been translated by the poet Thomas Campbell. The edition by C. A. Klotz (1827) contains a dissertation on the war-songs of different countries.

Tyrtaeus ; Tyrtaios; fl. mid-7th century BCE) was a Greek Elegy from Sparta. He wrote at a time of two crises affecting the city: a civic unrest threatening the authority of kings and elders, later recalled in a poem named Eunomia ('Law and Order') where he reminded citizens to respect the divine and constitutional roles of kings, council, and demos; and the Second Messenian War, during which he served as a sort of 'state poet', exhorting Spartans to fight to the death for their city. In the 4th century BCE, when Tyrtaeus was an established classic, Spartan armies on campaign were made to listen to his poetry, and the Suda states that he wrote 'martial songs', probably referring to the chants escorting armed dances and processions during some Spartan festivals.
