Absolut Vodka

==History==
Absolut was established in 1879 by Lars Olsson Smith and is produced in Åhus, Sweden. Smith challenged the city of Stockholm's liquor marketing monopoly with his vodka. It was sold outside the city border at a lower price than the monopoly's product. Smith offered free boat rides to the distillery and "Rent Brännvin" was highly successful.<ref></ref>
In 1917, the Swedish government monopolized the country's alcohol industry. Vodka was then sold nationwide under the name "Absolut Rent Brännvin". In 1979, the old name Absolut was picked up when the upper-price range ABSOLUT VODKA was introduced. Renat is the name of another vodka product sold by Pernod Ricard Sweden AB.
Absolut Vodka was introduced to the global market in 1979. Today, Absolut sells over 100 million litres of vodka annually (2018).<ref></ref> The vodka is made from winter wheat.
==Lars Olsson Smith==
Lars Olsson Smith was born 1836 in Kiaby and died 1913 in Karlskrona, Sweden. L.O. Smith was an entrepreneur, parliamentarian and founder of Absolut Rent Brännvin (Absolutely pure spirit). It was the inspiration for Absolut Vodka. L.O. Smith launched a method that removes contaminants such as glut in the spirits. L.O. Smith came from a peasant family in Blekinge and quickly made a career in the retail trade as an 6-year-old. He later moved to Stockholm and started manufacturing and selling vodka at his factory at Reimersholme.
