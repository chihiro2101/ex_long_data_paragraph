Lily of the valley

==Description==
Convallaria majalis is an herbaceous perennial plant that often forms extensive colonies by spreading underground stems called rhizomes. New upright shoots are formed at the ends of stolons in summer,<ref> urltoken Flora of China: Convallaria majalis</ref> these upright dormant stems are often called pips.<ref name=Mills2005></ref> These grow in the spring into new leafy shoots that still remain connected to the other shoots under ground. The stems grow to tall, with one or two leaf long; flowering stems have two leaves and a raceme of five to fifteen flowers on the stem apex.
The flowers have six white tepals (rarely pink), fused at the base to form a bell-shape, diameter, and sweetly scented; flowering is in late spring, in mild winters in the Northern Hemisphere it is in early March. The fruit is a small orange-red berry diameter that contains a few large whitish to brownish colored seeds that dry to a clear translucent round bead wide. Plants are self-sterile, and colonies consisting of a single clone do not set seed.<ref name=keiskei>Ohara, Masashi; Araki, Kiwakoi; Yamada, Etsukoi; Kawano, Shoichi, Life-history monographs of Japanese plants, 6: Convallaria keiskei Miq. (Convallariaceae), Plant Species Biology, Vol 21, No 2, August 2006, pp. 119–126(8), Blackwell Publishing</ref>
==Taxonomy==
In the APG III system, the genus is placed in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae (formerly the family Ruscaceae<ref></ref>). It was formerly placed in its own family Convallariaceae, and, like many lilioid monocots, before that in the lily family Liliaceae.
There are three varieties that have sometimes been separated out as distinct species or subspecies by some botanists.<ref></ref><ref>Weakley, A. S. 2020. Flora of the southeastern United States.

:*Convallaria majalis var. keiskei – from China and Japan, with red fruit and bowl-shaped flowers (now widely cited as Convallaria keiskei)<ref name=keiskei/><ref name="Plantfinder"></ref>
:*C. majalis var. majalis – from Eurasia, with white midribs on the flowers
:*C. majalis var. montana – from the United States, maybe with green-tinted midribs on the flowers<ref>A. S. Weakley does not list green midribs among the distinctive characteristics of C. pseudomajalis, as he calls this taxon. – Weakley, A. S. 2020. Flora of the southeastern United States. University of North Carolina Herbarium, North Carolina Botanical Garden. p.&nbsp;281 ( urltoken Download page)</ref>
Convallaria transcaucasica is recognised as a distinct species by some authorities, while the species formerly called Convallaria japonica is now classified as Ophiopogon japonicus.<ref name="Plantfinder"/>
==Distribution==
Convallaria majalis is a native of Europe, where it largely avoids the Mediterranean and Atlantic margins.<ref></ref> An eastern variety, C. majalis var. keiskei occurs in Japan and parts of eastern Asia. A limited native population of C. majalis var. montana (synonym C. majuscula) occurs in the Eastern United States.<ref> urltoken Flora of North America : Convallaria majalis</ref> There is, however, some debate as to the native status of the American variety.<ref>Gleason, Henry A. and Cronquist, Arthur, (1991), Manual of Vascular Plants of Northeastern United States and Adjacent Canada, New York Botanical Garden, Bronx, New York, pp. 839–840. – In reply to Cronquist, A. S. Weakley points out that there is “a broad suite of morphological distinctions from European C. majalis” and that C. pseudomajalis, as he calls this taxon, is typically found “on ridges remote from present or past habitations” which excludes the idea of the taxon stemming from garden escapes. – Weakley, A. S. 2020. Flora of the southeastern United States. University of North Carolina Herbarium, North Carolina Botanical Garden. p.&nbsp;281 ( urltoken Download page)</ref>
Like many perennial flowering plants, C. majalis exhibits dual reproductive modes by producing offspring asexually by vegetative means and by seed, produced via the fusion of gametes.<ref></ref>
==Ecology==
Convallaria majalis is a plant of partial shade, and mesophile type that prefers warm summers. It likes soils that are silty or sandy and acid to moderately alkaline,<ref></ref> with preferably a plentiful amount of humus. The Royal Horticultural Society states that slightly alkaline soils are the most favored.<ref>RHS Encyclopaedia of Perennials</ref> It is a Eurasia and suboceanic species that lives in mountains up to elevation.<ref></ref>
Convallaria majalis is used as a food plant by the larvae of some moth and butterfly (Lepidoptera) species including the grey chi. Adults and larvae of the leaf beetle Lilioceris merdigera are also able to tolerate the cardenolides and thus feed on the leaves.<ref></ref>
==Cultivation==
Convallaria majalis is widely grown in gardens for its scented flowers and ground-covering abilities in shady locations. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.<ref name = RHSAG></ref><ref></ref> In favourable conditions it can form large colonies.
Various kinds and cultivars are grown, including those with double flowers, rose-colored flowers, variegated foliage and ones that grow larger than the typical species.<ref name="Plantfinder"/>
*C. majalis 'Albostriata' has white-striped leaves
*C. majalis 'Green Tapestry', 'Haldon Grange', 'Hardwick Hall', 'Hofheim', 'Marcel', 'Variegata' and 'Vic Pawlowski's Gold' are other variegated cultivars<ref name="Plantfinder"/>
*C. majalis 'Berlin Giant' and C. majalis 'Géant de Fortin' (syn. 'Fortin's Giant') are larger-growing cultivars<ref name="Plantfinder"/>
*C. majalis 'Flore Pleno' has double flowers.<ref name="Plantfinder"/>
*C. majalis 'Rosea' sometimes found under the name C. majalis var. rosea, has pink flowers.<ref name="Plantfinder"/>
Traditionally Convallaria majalis has been grown in pots and winter forced to provide flowers during the winter months, both for as potted plants and as cut flowers.<ref name="Journal of horticulture and practical gardening"></ref>
==Chemistry==
Roughly 38 different cardiac glycosides (cardenolides) &ndash; which are highly toxic if consumed by humans or domestic animals &ndash; occur in the plant, including:<ref name=csu/><ref name=uc/><ref name="roberts"></ref>
). European herbalists' use of the phrase to refer to a specific plant species seems to have appeared relatively late in the 16th<ref> urltoken or 15th century.<ref name=keil>Keil, Gundolf. „Es hat vnser libe fraw gesprochen in dem puch der libe: ‚Ich pin ein plvm des tals vnd auch des grvnen waldes‘“: Die Einführung der Convallarin-Glykoside als Hinweis auf mährisch-schlesische Provenienz. In: Iva Kratochvilová, Lenka Vaňková (Hrsg.): Germanistik im Spiegel der Generationen. Festschrift Zdeněk Masařík. Opava/ Ostrava 2004, S. 72–132.</ref> The New Latin term convallaria (coined by Carl Linnaeus) and, for example, Swedish name derives from the corresponding phrase lilium convallium in the Vulgate.

Lily of the valley, Convallaria majalis ,<ref>Sunset Western Garden Book, 1995:606–607</ref> sometimes written lily-of-the-valley,<ref name=BSBI07></ref> is a woodland flowering plant with sweetly scented, pendent, bell-shaped white flowers borne in sprays in spring. It is native throughout the cool temperate Northern Hemisphere in Asia and Europe.
Due to its dense content of cardiac glycosides, it is highly poisonous if consumed by humans or domestic animals.<ref name="csu"></ref><ref name="uc"></ref>
Other names include May bells, Our Lady's tears, and Mary's tears. Its French name, muguet, sometimes appears in the names of perfumes imitating the flower's scent. In pre-modern England, the plant was known as glovewort (as it was a wort used to create a salve for sore hands), or Apollinaris (according to a legend that it was discovered by Apollo).<ref></ref>
