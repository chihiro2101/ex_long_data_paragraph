Edward

==History==
The name Edward was popular in Anglo-Saxon England, but the rule of the Norman and Plantagenet dynasties had effectively ended its use amongst the upper classes.<ref></ref> The popularity of the name was revived when King Henry III of England named his firstborn son, the future Edward I of England, Edward as part of his efforts to promote a cult around Edward the Confessor, whom Henry had a deep admiration for.<ref></ref>
==Variant forms==
The name has been adopted in the Iberian peninsula since the 15th century, due to Edward, King of Portugal, whose mother was English. The Spanish/Portuguese forms of the name are Eduardo and Duarte. Other variant forms include French Édouard, Italian Edoardo, German and Dutch Eduard and Scandinavian/Czech Edvard.
