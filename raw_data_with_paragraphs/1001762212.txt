===1896–1903===
In 1896, Scottish immigrant Alexander Winton, owner of the Winton Bicycle Company, turned from bicycle production to an experimental single-cylinder automobile before starting his car company.<ref name= "100 Years" />
The company was incorporated on March 15, 1897. Its first automobiles were built by hand. Each vehicle had fancy painted sides, padded seats, a leather roof, and gas lamps. B.F. Goodrich made the tires for Winton.<ref name="Hedgbeth"></ref>
By this time, Winton had already produced two fully operational prototype automobiles. In May of that year, the 10&nbsp;hp (7.5&nbsp;kW) model achieved the astonishing speed of on a test around a Cleveland horse track. However, the new invention was still subject to much skepticism, so to prove his automobile's durability and usefulness, Alexander Winton had his car undergo an endurance run from Cleveland to New York City.<ref name="Hedgbeth" />
On March 24, 1898, Robert Allison of Port Carbon, Pennsylvania, became the first person to buy a Winton automobile after seeing the first automobile advertisement in Scientific American.<ref name="Hedgbeth" /> Later that year the Winton Motor Carriage Company sold 21 more vehicles,<ref name="100 Years"/> including one to James Ward Packard, who later founded the Packard automobile company after Winton challenged a very dissatisfied Packard to do better.<ref name= "Clymer 1877"></ref> This is the same mistake that Enzo Ferrari would make with Ferruccio Lamborghini.
Winton sold his first manufactured semi-truck in 1899. More than one hundred Winton vehicles were sold that year,<ref name= "100 Years"></ref> making the company the largest manufacturer of gasoline-powered automobiles in the United States. This success led to the opening of the first automobile dealership by Mr. H. W. Koler<ref name= "wintonfamily"></ref> in Reading, Pennsylvania. To deliver the vehicles, in 1899, Winton built the first automobile hauler in America.<ref name="Hedgbeth" /> One of these 1899 Wintons was purchased by Larz Anderson and his new wife, Isabel Weld Perkins.
Publicity generated sales. In 1901, the news that both Reginald Vanderbilt and Alfred Vanderbilt had purchased Winton automobiles boosted the company's image substantially. Models at the time were a 2-passenger Runabout with a 1-cylinder engine (8&nbsp;hp) and a 4-passenger Touring and Mail Delivery Van, also with a 1-cylinder engine (9&nbsp;hp).<ref name="Kimes 1996"></ref> That year, Winton lost a race at Grosse Pointe to Henry Ford. Winton vowed a comeback and win. He produced the 1902 Winton Bullet, which set an unofficial land speed record of in Cleveland that year. The Bullet was defeated in another Ford by famed driver Barney Oldfield, but two more Bullet race cars were built.
In 1903, Dr. Horatio Nelson Jackson made the first successful automobile drive across the United States.<ref name= "Clymer 1877" /> On a $50 bet, he purchased a slightly used 2-cylinder, Winton touring car and hired a mechanic to accompany him. Starting in San Francisco, California, ending in Manhattan, New York City, New York. The trip lasted 63 days, 12 hours, and 30 minutes, including breakdowns and delays while waiting for parts to arrive (especially in Cleveland.<ref></ref>) The two men often drove miles out of the way to find a passable road, repeatedly hoisted the Winton up and over rocky terrain and mud holes with a block and tackle, or were pulled out of soft sand by horse teams.<ref></ref> In 1903, there were only 150 miles of paved road in the entire country, all inside city limits. There were no road signs or maps. They once paid the exorbitant price of $5 for five gallons of gasoline. Jackson and his partner followed rivers and streams, transcontinental railroad tracks, sheep trails, and dirt back roads.<ref></ref> 
===1904–1924===
The 1904 Winton was a five-passenger tonneau-equipped tourer which sold for USD2,500. By contrast, the Enger 40 was US$2,000,<ref name= "Clymer 1877" /> the FAL US$1,750,<ref name= "Clymer 1877" /> an Oakland 40 US$1,600,<ref name= "Clymer 1877" /> the Cole 30<ref name= "Clymer 1877" /> and Colt Runabout US$1,500,<ref name= "Clymer 1877" /> while the (1913) Lozier Light Six Metropolitan started at US$3,250,<ref name= "Clymer 1877" /> American's lowest-priced model was US$4,250,<ref name= "Clymer 1877" /> and Lozier's Big Six were US$5,000 and up.<ref name= "Clymer 1877" />

===Winton Engine Company===
In 1912, Winton started producing diesel engines for stationary and marine use, and gasoline engines for heavy vehicles, independent of Winton's automobile production. The subsidiary Winton Engine Company remained successful while Winton's automotive sales went into decline and would outlive the Winton Motor Carriage Company. Winton became the main supplier of engines for Doodlebug (rail car) in the 1920s.
===Sale to General Motors===
On June 20, 1930, Winton Engine Company was sold to General Motors and on June 30 was reorganized as the Winton Engine Corporation subsidiary of GM. It produced the first practical two-stroke diesel engines in the 400 to 1,200&nbsp;hp (300 to 900&nbsp;kW) range, which powered early the diesel locomotives of Electro-Motive Diesel (another GM subsidiary), as well as US Navy submarines. In 1934, a Winton 8-cylinder, 8-201-A diesel engine powered the revolutionary streamlined passenger train the Pioneer Zephyr, the first American diesel-powered mainline train. The Winton Engine Corporation provided 201 Series engines for rail use until late 1938, when it was reorganized as the General Motors Cleveland Diesel Engine Division, which produced the GM 567 series locomotive engines, and other large diesels for marine and stationary use. In 1941, locomotive engine production became part of GM's Electro-Motive Division (EMD). In 1962, Cleveland Diesel was absorbed by EMD, which is still in business.<ref name=TugCleveland></ref><ref name=Pinkepank(73)></ref>
===Marine engines===
Winton and Cleveland engines were used widely by the US Navy in the Second World War, powering submarines, destroyer escorts, and numerous auxiliaries. The Winton engines were systematically replaced with the more reliable Cleveland engines during refittings during the war.<ref name=TugCleveland /><ref name= "Silverstone(66)"></ref><ref name="Jane's(98)"></ref><ref name="NavSource SS-285"></ref><ref name="NavSource DE 99"></ref><ref name="NavSource ATA 121"></ref>
==In popular culture==
A purpose-built "Winton Flyer" features prominently in William Faulkner's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1962 novel The Reivers. In fact, the 1969 film version of the novel starring Steve McQueen was known as The Yellow Winton Flyer in the UK.
A 1962 episode of Dennis the Menace, "Horseless Carriage Club," centers around a trip Dennis and his friends are supposed to take in Mr. Wilson's 1912 Winton.
