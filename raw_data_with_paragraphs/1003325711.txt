Ruth Westheimer

== Early life and education ==
Westheimer was born Karola Ruth Siegel on June 4, 1928, in Wiesenfeld (now part of Karlstadt am Main), Germany, the only child of Orthodox Jews, Irma (née Hanauer), a housekeeper, and Julius Siegel, a notions wholesaler and son of the family for whom Irma worked.<ref></ref> She was given an early grounding in Judaism by her father, who took her regularly to the synagogue in the Nordend district of Frankfurt, where they lived. Her father was taken away by the Nazis a week after Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass, in 1938. Westheimer cried while her father was taken away by men in gloss-finished boots, while her grandmother gave the men money and asked them to care for him. Westheimer's mother and grandmother decided that Germany was too dangerous due to the tension and Nazi violence growing, so in January 1939 they sent Westheimer on the Kindertransport to Switzerland. Westheimer, age 11, arrived at an orphanage of a Jewish charity in Heiden and took on the role of a caregiver and mother-like figure to the younger children there. Westheimer was not allowed to take classes at the local school, but a fellow orphan boy would sneak his textbooks to Westheimer at night so she could learn and continue her education.
While at the orphanage, Westheimer corresponded with her mother and grandmother via letters. When the letters ceased in 1941, Westheimer knew she would not hear from them again. The details of her parents' deaths due to the Holocaust are also included in the Hulu documentary about Westheimer titled Ask Dr. Ruth. Her father was killed in the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1942. Her mother was killed during the Holocaust, but there is no specific information about her death, or about how and when she died. In the data base at the Yad Vashem World Holocaust Remembrance Center, Westheimer's mother is categorized by the word verschollen or 'disappeared.'
Westheimer decided to emigrate to British-controlled Mandatory Palestine. There, at 17, she "first had sexual intercourse on a starry night, in a haystack, without contraception." She later told The New York Times that "I am not happy about that, but I know much better now and so does everyone who listens to my radio program."<ref name="NYT">Dullea, Georgia.

== Early career ==
After receiving her Ed.D., she briefly worked for Planned Parenthood and this experience encouraged her to continue studying human sexuality. She went on to work as a postdoctoral researcher for Helen Singer Kaplan at New York-Presbyterian Hospital.<ref name=GAH /> She continued to work there as an adjunct associate professor for five years. She also taught at Lehman College, Brooklyn College, Adelphi University, Columbia University and West Point.<ref name="dr_ruth_dot_com"></ref>
== Media career ==
Dr. Ruth's media career began in 1980 when her radio show, Sexually Speaking, debuted on WYNY-FM in New York City.<ref name="Sterling"></ref> She was offered this opportunity after she gave a lecture to New York broadcasters about the need for sex education programming to help deal with issues of contraception and unwanted pregnancies. Betty Elam, the community affairs manager at WYNY, was impressed with her talk and offered Westheimer $25 per week to make Sexually Speaking, which started as a 15-minute show airing every Sunday at midnight.<ref name="biography"></ref> By 1983 her show was the top-rated radio show in the area, and in 1984 NBC Radio began syndicating it nationwide as the Dr. Ruth Show. She went on to produce her radio show until 1990.<ref name="Makers"></ref> Described as the "Sister Wendy of Sexuality", Dr. Ruth helped to revolutionize talk about sex and sexuality on radio and television, and she was noted for having "an accent only a psychologist could love".<ref name="Barron"></ref> She became known for being candid and funny, but respectful, and for her tag phrase "Get some".<ref name="Kahn"></ref><ref name="Griset"></ref> One journalist described her unique voice as "a cross between Henry Kissinger and Minnie Mouse".<ref name="Schuessler"></ref>
In 1984, Westheimer began hosting several television programs on the Lifetime TV network and one in syndication. Her first show was Good Sex! With Dr. Ruth Westheimer, airing for a half hour at 10&nbsp;pm on weeknights. This show was expanded in 1985 to a full hour and its name was changed to The Dr. Ruth Show. In 1987 she began a separate half hour syndicated series on many broadcast stations called Ask Dr. Ruth which was co-hosted by Larry Angelo. Dr. Ruth returned to the Lifetime network in 1988 with The All New Dr. Ruth Show, which was followed in 1989 by two teen advice shows called What's Up, Dr. Ruth? and a call-in show, You're on the Air with Dr. Ruth in 1990.<ref></ref> In 1993 Westheimer and Israeli TV host, Arad Nir, hosted a talk show in Hebrew titled Min Tochnit, on the newly opened Israeli Channel 2. The show was similar to her US Sexually Speaking show. The name of the show, Min Tochnit, is a play on words: literally "Kind of a program", but "Min" (מין) in Hebrew also means "sex" and "gender".<ref name="imdb"></ref>
During the 1980s "Dr. Ruth" became a household name; she made guest appearances on several network television shows, including The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and Late Night with David Letterman.<ref name="Wolf"></ref> She also made frequent appearances on the syndicated revival of Hollywood Squares that ran from 1986 to 1989. In the 1990s Westheimer appeared as herself in episode 89 of Quantum Leap, the episode title being "Dr. Ruth". She appeared on Tom Chapin's album This Pretty Planet, in the song "Two Kinds of Seagulls", in which she and Chapin sing of various animals that reproduce sexually. "It takes two to tingle" says the song. Dr. Ruth also appeared in several commercial advertisements, including a 1994 Honda Prelude ad and an ad for Clairol Herbal Essences shampoo and body wash.<ref name="prelude"></ref><ref name="clairol"></ref>
Between 2001 and 2007, Westheimer made regular appearances on the PBS children's television series Between the Lions as "Dr. Ruth Wordheimer" in a spoof of her therapist role in which she helps anxious readers and spellers overcome their fear of long words. In January 2009, the 55th anniversary issue of Playboy magazine included Westheimer as #13 in a list of the 55 most important people in sex from the past 55 years.<ref name="Geller"></ref> In October 2013 the play Becoming Dr. Ruth opened Off Broadway. Actress Debra Jo Rupp played the role of Dr. Ruth. The play showcased the sex therapist's life from fleeing the Nazis in the Kindertransport and joining the Haganah in Jerusalem as a scout and sniper, to her struggles to succeed as a single mother coming to America.<ref name="Rooney"></ref> Eileen DeSandre played Dr. Ruth in the Virginia Repertory Theatre production of Becoming Dr. Ruth.<ref name="Wren"></ref>

Westheimer is an accomplished ethnographer. Her studies in this field include the Ethiopian Jews, Papua New Guinea's Trobriand people, and the Druze, a sect originating from Shia Islam now residing in Israel, Syria and Lebanon. The latter were the subject of her 2007 PBS documentary The Olive and the Tree: The Secret Strength of the Druze and a book of the same title.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
Westheimer is a trustee of the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York City.<ref></ref>
A documentary about her life, Ask Dr. Ruth, premiered in U.S. theaters on May 3, 2019 and was released on Hulu on June 1, 2019. Having previously avoided discussing her early years and how the Holocaust affected her family and herself, Westheimer believes that current events make it necessary for her to "stand up and be counted." She stated that seeing child refugees being separated from their parents upsets her, because her own story is reflected in what they are going through.<ref></ref>
Westheimer continues to be an active figure. In addition to the documentary released about her this year, she has recently published her 45th book. On her 91st birthday (June 4), Westheimer visited the Ellen DeGeneres show,<ref></ref> and visited Ellen's show again in November 2019, taking questions from the audience.<ref></ref> In 2019 alone, Westheimer has appeared on Late Night with Seth Meyers,<ref></ref> The View,<ref></ref> and Strahan, Sara and Keke.<ref></ref>
