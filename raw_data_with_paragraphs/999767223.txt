==Description==
The common warthog is a medium-sized species, with a head-and-body length ranging from , and shoulder height from . Females, at , are typically slightly smaller and lighter in weight than males, at .<ref name="diversity"/><ref></ref> A warthog is identifiable by the two pairs of tusks protruding from the mouth and curving upwards. The lower pair, which is far shorter than the upper pair, becomes razor-sharp by rubbing against the upper pair every time the mouth is opened and closed. The upper Canine tooth can grow to long and have a wide elliptical cross section, being about deep and wide. A tusk will curve 90° or more from the root, and will not lie flat on a table, as it curves somewhat backwards as it grows. The tusks are not used for digging,<ref></ref> but are used for combat with other hogs, and in defense against predators – the lower set can inflict severe wounds.
Common warthog ivory is taken from the constantly growing canine teeth. The tusks, particularly the upper set, work in much the same way as elephant tusks with all designs scaled down. Tusks are carved predominantly for the tourist trade in east and southern Africa.
The head of the common warthog is large, with a mane down the spine to the middle of the back.<ref name="diversity"></ref> Sparse hair covers the body. Its color is usually black or brown. Tails are long and end with a tuft of hair. Common warthogs do not have subcutaneous fat and the coat is sparse, making them susceptible to extreme environmental temperatures.<ref name="diversity"/>
==Ecology==
The common warthog is the only pig species that has adapted to grazing and savanna habitats.<ref name="Estes 1991">Estes, R. (1991). The Behavior Guide to African Mammals, Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, Primates. Los Angeles, University of California Press. pp. 218–221 .</ref> Its diet is omnivorous, composed of grasses, roots, berries and other fruits, bark, fungi, insects, eggs and carrion.<ref name="Kleiman 2004">Kleiman, D.G., Geist, V., McDade, M.C. (2004). Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia. The Gale Group Inc.</ref> The diet is seasonably variable, depending on availability of different food items. During the wet seasons, warthogs graze<ref name="Estes 1991"/> on short perennial grasses.<ref name="Kingdon 1979">Kingdon, J. (1979). East African Mammals: An Atlas of Evolution in Africa, Volume 3, Part B: Large Mammals. Chicago, University of Chicago Press. pp. 231–249.</ref> During the dry seasons, they subsist on bulbs, rhizomes, and nutritious roots.<ref name="Estes 1991"/><ref name="Kingdon 1979"/> Warthogs are powerful diggers, using both their snouts and feet. When feeding, they often bend their front feet backwards and move around on the wrists.<ref></ref> Calloused pads that protect the wrists during such movement form quite early in the development of the fetus. Although they can dig their own burrows, they commonly occupy abandoned burrows of aardvarks<ref name="Kingdon 1979"/> and other animals. The common warthog commonly reverses into burrows, with its head facing the opening and ready to burst out if necessary. Common warthogs will wallow in mud to cope with high temperatures and huddle together to cope with low temperatures.<ref>Vercammen, P., Mason, D.R. " urltoken Pigs, Peccaries and Hippos Status Survey and Action Plan".</ref>
Although capable of fighting (males aggressively fight each other during mating season), the common warthog's primary defense is to flee by means of fast sprinting. When threatened, Warthogs can run speeds of up to 48&nbsp;km/h (30&nbsp;mph), will run with their tails sticking up and will enter their dens rear first with tusks facing out.<ref></ref> The common warthog's main predators are humans, lions, leopards, cheetahs, crocodiles, wild dogs and hyenas. Birds of prey such as Verreaux's eagle owls and martial eagles sometimes prey on piglets.<ref></ref><ref>Owls of the World by Konig, Weick & Becking. Yale University Press (2009), .</ref> However, if a female common warthog has any piglets, she will defend them very aggressively. On occasion, common warthogs have been observed charging and even wounding large predators. Common warthogs have also been observed allowing banded mongooses and vervet monkeys to groom them to remove ticks.<ref> urltoken Warthog – Africa's Jester . Wildwatch.com.

==Social behavior and reproduction==
Common warthogs are not territorial, but instead occupy a home range.<ref></ref> Common warthogs live in groups called sounders. Females live in sounders with their young and with other females.<ref name="Kleiman 2004"/> Females tend to stay in their natal groups, while males leave, but stay within the home range.<ref name="Kleiman 2004"/> Subadult males associate in bachelor groups, but live alone when they become adults.<ref name="Estes 1991"/> Adult males only join sounders with estrous females. Warthogs have two facial glands: the tusk gland and the sebaceous gland. Common warthogs of both sexes begin to mark around six to seven months old.<ref name="Estes 1982"></ref> Males tend to mark more than females.<ref name="Estes 1982"/> They mark sleeping and feeding areas and waterholes.<ref name="Estes 1982"/> Common warthogs use tusk marking for courtship, for antagonistic behaviors, and to establish status.<ref name="Estes 1982"/>

Common warthogs are seasonal breeders.<ref name="Estes 1991"/> Rutting begins in the late rainy or early dry season and birthing begins near the start of the following rainy season.<ref name="Estes 1991"/> The mating system is described as "overlap promiscuity"; the males have ranges overlapping several female ranges, and the daily behavior of the female is unpredictable. Boars employ two mating strategies during the rut. With the "staying tactic", a boar will stay and defend certain females or a resource valuable to them.<ref name="Sandell 1992"></ref> In the "roaming tactic", boars seek out estrous sows and compete for them.<ref name="Sandell 1992"/> Boars will wait for sows to emerge outside their burrows.<ref name="Estes 1991"/> A dominant boar will displace any other boar that also tries to court his female. When a sow leaves her den, the boar will try to demonstrate his dominance and then follow her before copulation.<ref name="Estes 1991"/> For the "staying tactic", monogamy, female-defense polygyny, or resource-defense polygyny is promoted, while the "roaming tactic" promotes scramble-competition polygyny.<ref name="Sandell 1992"/>
The typical gestation period is five to six months. When they are about to give birth, sows temporarily leave their families to farrow in a separate hole.<ref name="Estes 1991"/> The litter is 2–8 piglets, with 2–4 typical. The sow will stay in the hole for several weeks, nursing her piglets.<ref name="Estes 1991"/> Common warthog sows have been observed to nurse foster piglets if they lose their own litter.<ref name="Jensen 1999">Jensen, S.P., Siefert, L., Okori, J.J.L., Clutlon-Brock, T.H. (1999). "Age Related Participation in Allosucking by Nursing Warthogs." Journal of Zoology London 248(4): 443–449</ref> This behavior, known as allosucking, makes them alloparenting. Allosucking does not seem to be a case of mistaken identity or milk theft,<ref name="Jensen 1999"/> and may be a sign of kin altruism. Piglets begin grazing at about two to three weeks and are weaned by six months.<ref name="Estes 1991"/> Piglets quickly attain mobility and stay close to their mothers for defense.<ref>Walther, F. R.

==Conservation status==
As of 1999, the common warthog population in southern Africa is estimated to be about 250,000.<ref>Cumming, D. H. M. (1999).

Biodiversity Support Program. Washington, DC, USA.</ref> Typical densities range between one and 10 per km<sup>2</sup> in protected areas, but local densities of 77 per km<sup>2</sup> were found on short grass in Nakuru National Park.<ref>Radke, R. (1991). "Monographie des warzenschweines (Phacochoerus aethiopicus)". Bongo, Berlin 18: 119–134.</ref> The species is susceptible to drought and hunting (especially with dogs), which may result in localized extinctions.<ref name=iucn/> The common warthog is present in numerous protected areas across its extensive range.<ref name=iucn/>

The common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) is a wild member of the pig family (Suidae) found in grassland, savanna, and woodland in sub-Saharan Africa.<ref name=iucn/><ref name= MSW3></ref> In the past, it was commonly treated as a subspecies of P. aethiopicus, but today that scientific name is restricted to the desert warthog of northern Kenya, Somalia, and eastern Ethiopia.<ref></ref>
