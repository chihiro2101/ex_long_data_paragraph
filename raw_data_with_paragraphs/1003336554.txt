==Background==

After the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and referendum to create the Islamic Republic on March 29 and 30, the new government needed to craft a new constitution. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, ordered an election for the Assembly of Experts, the body tasked with writing the constitution.<ref></ref> The assembly presented the constitution on October 24, 1979, and Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini and Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan approved it.
The 1979 Constitution designated the Supreme Leader of Iran as the head of state and the President and Prime Minister as the heads of government. The post of Prime Minister was abolished in 1989.
The 1980 Iranian presidential election was held on January 25, 1980 and resulted in the election of Abulhassan Banisadr with 76% of the votes. Banisadr was impeached on June 22, 1981 by Parliament. Until the early election on July 24, 1981, the duties of the President were undertaken by the Provisional Presidential Council. Mohammad-Ali Rajai was elected president on July 24, 1981 and took office on August 2. Rajai was in office for less than one month because he and his prime minister were both assassinated. Once again a Provisional Presidential Council filled the office until October 13, 1981 when Ali Khamenei was elected president.
The election on August 3, 2005 resulted in a victory for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The election on June 12, 2009 was reported by government authorities as a victory for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the incumbent candidate, although this is greatly disputed by supporters of rival candidates, who noted the statistical anomalies in voting reports and large-scale overvoting in the officially announced tallies.<ref></ref>
Ali Khamenei, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hassan Rouhani were each elected president for two terms.
==Qualifications and election==
The procedures for presidential election and all other elections in Iran are outlined by the Supreme Leader.<ref name="Tehran Times"/> The President of Iran is elected for a four-year term in a national election by universal adult suffrage for everyone of at least 18 years of age.<ref> urltoken </ref> Candidates for the presidency must be approved by the Council of Guardians, a twelve-member body consisting of six clerics (selected by Iran's Supreme Leader) and six lawyers (proposed by the Supreme Leader-appointed head of Iran's judicial system, and voted in by the Parliament).<ref name=baz></ref> According to the Constitution of Iran candidates for the presidency must possess the following qualifications:
*Iranian origin;
*Iranian nationality;
*administrative capacity and resourcefulness;
*a good past record;
*trustworthiness and piety; and
*convinced belief in the fundamental principles of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the official madhhab of the country.<ref> urltoken Constitution of Iran Article 115 - Qualifications</ref><ref></ref>
Within these guidelines the Council vetoes candidates who are deemed unacceptable. The approval process is considered to be a check on the president's power, and usually amounts to a small number of candidates being approved. In the 1997 election, for example, only four out of 238 presidential candidates were approved by the council. Western observers have routinely criticized the approvals process as a way for the Council and Supreme Leader to ensure that only conservative and like-minded Islamic fundamentalists can win office. However, the council rejects the criticism, citing approval of so-called reformists in previous elections. The council rejects most of the candidates stating that they are not "a well-known political figure", a requirement by the current law.
The President must be elected with a majority of the popular vote. If no candidate receives a majority in the first round, a runoff election is held between the top two candidates.
===Presidential council===
According to the Iranian constitution, when the President dies or is impeached, a special provisional Presidential Council temporarily rules in his place until an election can be held.
The President automatically becomes the Head of the Supreme National Security Council and the Head of the Council of Cultural Revolution of Iran.
==Powers and responsibilities==
The President's duties include the following, subject to supervision and approval by the Supreme Leader:
*Second in command (after Supreme Leader) of the executive branch of government and chairman of the cabinet
*The deputy commander-in-chief of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army
*Declare a state of emergency After the passage of the parliament (The proclamation of martial law is forbidden.)

some of these duties require the approval of the Supreme Leader. <ref></ref>
==Oath of office==
<blockquote>I, as the President, upon the Qur'an and in the presence of the Iran, do hereby swear in the name of Allah to safeguard the State religion, the system of the Islamic republic and the Constitution of the country; to use all my talents and abilities in the discharge of responsibilities undertaken by me; to devote myself to the service of the people, glory of the country, promotion of religion and morality, support of right and propagation of justice; to refrain from being Autocracy; to protect the freedom and dignity of individuals and the rights of the Nation recognized by the Constitution; to spare no efforts in safeguarding the frontiers and the political, economic and cultural freedoms of the country; to guard the power entrusted to me by the Nation as a sacred trust like an honest and faithful trustee, by seeking help from God and following the example of the Muhammad and the sacred Imams, peace be upon them, and to entrust it to the one elected by the Nation after me.</blockquote>
== Commentary on the presidency in constitution ==
TIME Magazine noted that presidential elections in Iran change nothing as Supreme Leader Khamenei — and not the President — wields the ultimate power.<ref></ref> Tallha Abdulrazaq, an Iraqi researcher at the University of Exeter's Strategy and Security Institute, stated that Khamenei, the longtime Supreme Leader of Iran, always uses the president as a kind of a buffer zone between him and the people. “Anything that goes right, Khamenei then can say 'I am the wise leader who put this guy in charge and he made the right policy decisions.' Anything that goes wrong, he can say ‘we should get rid of this guy. He is not good for the country, he is not good for you.’"<ref></ref>
