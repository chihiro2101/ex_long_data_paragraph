Kilroy was here

== Origin and use of the phrase ==
The phrase may have originated through United States servicemen who would draw the picture and the text "Kilroy was here" on the walls and other places where they were stationed, encamped, or visited. An ad in Life magazine noted that WWII-era servicemen were fond of claiming that "whatever beach-head they stormed, they always found notices chalked up ahead of them, that 'Kilroy was here.<ref></ref> Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable notes that it was particularly associated with the Air Transport Command, at least when observed in the United Kingdom.<ref name="Brewer's: Cassell, 1956. p. 523">Brewer's: Cassell, 1956. p. 523.</ref> At some point, the graffiti (Chad) and slogan (Kilroy was here) must have merged.<ref name=quinion/>
Many sources claim origin as early as 1939.<ref name="dope"/><ref></ref><ref name=jbrown></ref> An early example of the phrase may date from 1937, before World War II. The US History Channel broadcast Fort Knox: Secrets Revealed in 2007 included a shot of a chalked "KILROY WAS HERE" dated 13 May 1937. Fort Knox's vault was loaded in 1937 and inaccessible until the 1970s, when an audit was carried out and the footage was shot.<ref name=phrases/> However, historian Paul Urbahns was involved in the production of the program, and he says that the footage was a reconstruction.<ref></ref>
According to one story, German intelligence found the phrase on captured American equipment. This led Adolf Hitler to believe that Kilroy could be the name or codename of a high-level Allied spy. At the time of the Potsdam Conference in 1945, it was rumored that Stalin found "Kilroy was here" written in the VIP bathroom, prompting him to ask his aides who Kilroy was.<ref name="openwriting.com" /><ref>Rottman, Gordon L.: FUBAR: Soldier Slang of World War II </ref> War photographer Robert Capa noted a use of the phrase at Bastogne in December 1944: "On the black, charred walls of an abandoned barn, scrawled in white chalk, was the legend of McAuliffe's GIs: KILROY WAS STUCK HERE."<ref></ref>
=== Foo was here ===
Digger History, the Unofficial history of the Australian & New Zealand Armed Services, says of Foo that "He was chalked on the side of railway carriages, appeared in probably every camp that the 1st AIF World War I served in and generally made his presence felt". If this is the case, then "Foo was here" predates the American version of World War II, "Kilroy was here", by about 25 years. "Foo" was thought of as a gremlin by the Royal Australian Air Force.<ref></ref> It has been claimed that Foo came from the acronym for Forward Observation Officer.
=== Real Kilroys ===
The Oxford English Dictionary says simply that Kilroy was "the name of a mythical person".<ref name=quinion/> One theory identifies James J. Kilroy (1902–1962), an American shipyard inspector, as the man behind the signature.<ref name=quinion></ref> The New York Times indicated J. J. Kilroy as the origin in 1946, based on the results of a contest conducted by the American Transit Association<ref name=jbrown/><ref name=nytimes/> to establish the origin of the phenomenon.<ref></ref> Usually, inspectors made a small chalk mark which welders used to erase, so that they would be paid double for their work. To prevent this, Kilroy marked work he had inspected and approved with the phrase "Kilroy was here" in more durable crayon.<ref></ref> The article noted that Kilroy had marked the ships as they were being built as a way to be sure that he had inspected a compartment, and the phrase would be found chalked in places that nobody could have reached for graffiti, such as inside sealed hull spaces.<ref name=nytimes> urltoken "Transit Association Ships a Street Car To Shelter Family of 'Kilroy Was Here'", The New York Times, 24 December 1946.</ref> Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable notes this as a possible origin, but suggests that "the phrase grew by accident."<ref name="Brewer's: Cassell, 1956. p. 523" />
The Lowell Sun reported in November 1945 that Sgt. Francis J. Kilroy Jr. from Everett, Massachusetts, wrote "Kilroy will be here next week" on a barracks bulletin board at a Boca Raton, Florida, airbase while ill with flu, and the phrase was picked up by other airmen and quickly spread abroad.<ref name=phrases/> The Associated Press similarly reported Sgt. Kilroy's account of being hospitalized early in World War II, and his friend Sgt. James Maloney wrote the phrase on a bulletin board. Maloney continued to write the shortened phrase when he was shipped out a month later, according to the AP account, and other airmen soon picked it up. Francis Kilroy only wrote the phrase a couple of times.<ref name=quinion/><ref></ref>
== Chad ==
The figure was initially known in the United Kingdom as "Mr Chad" and would appear with the slogan "Wot, no sugar" or a similar phrase bemoaning shortages and rationing.<ref name="openwriting.com"></ref><ref name="bbc"></ref> He often appeared with a single curling hair that resembled a question mark and with crosses in his eyes.<ref name=wot></ref> The phrase "Wot, no &mdash;?" pre-dates "Chad" and was widely used separately from the doodle.<ref name=phrases/> Chad was used by the RAF and civilians; he was known in the army as Private Snoops, and in the navy he was called The Watcher.<ref></ref> Chad might have first been drawn by British cartoonist George Edward Chatterton in 1938. Chatterton was nicknamed "Chat", which may then have become "Chad".<ref name="openwriting.com" /> Life Magazine wrote in 1946 that the RAF and army were competing to claim him as their own invention, but they agreed that he had first appeared around 1944.<ref name=wot/> The character resembles Alice the Goon, a character in Popeye who first appeared in 1933,<ref name=perception/> and another name for Chad was "The Goon".<ref name=wot/>
A spokesman for the Royal Air Force Museum London suggested in 1977 that Chad was probably an adaptation of the Greek letter Omega, used as the symbol for electrical resistance; his creator was probably an electrician in a ground crew.<ref></ref> Life suggested that Chad originated with REME, and noted that a symbol for alternating current resembles Chad (a sine wave through a straight line), that the plus and minus signs in his eyes represent polarity, and that his fingers are symbols of electrical resistors.<ref name=wot/> The character is usually drawn in Australia with pluses and minuses as eyes and the nose and eyes resemble a distorted sine wave.<ref name=perception></ref> The Guardian suggested in 2000 that "Mr. Chad" was based on a diagram representing an electrical circuit. One correspondent said that a man named Dickie Lyle was at RAF Yatesbury in 1941, and he drew a version of the diagram as a face when the instructor had left the room and wrote "Wot, no leave?" beneath it.<ref></ref> This idea was repeated in a submission to the BBC in 2005 which included a story of a 1941 radar lecturer in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, who drew the circuit diagram with the words "WOT! No electrons?"<ref name=bbc/> The RAF Cranwell Apprentices Association says that the image came from a diagram of how to approximate a square wave using sine waves, also at RAF Yatesbury and with an instructor named Chadwick. This version was initially called Domie or Doomie,<ref></ref> and Life noted that Doomie was used by the RAF.<ref name=wot/> REME claimed that the name came from their training school, nicknamed "Chad's Temple"; the RAF claimed that it arose from Chadwick House at a Lancashire radio school; and the Desert Rats claimed that it came from an officer in El Alamein.<ref name=wot/>
It is unclear how Chad gained widespread popularity or became conflated with Kilroy. It was, however, widely in use by the late part of the war and in the immediate post-war years, with slogans ranging from the simple "What, no bread?" or "Wot, no Tea?" to the plaintive; one sighting was on the side of a British 1st Airborne Division glider in Operation Market Garden with the complaint "Wot, no engines?" The Los Angeles Times reported in 1946 that Chad was "the No. 1 doodle", noting his appearance on a wall in the Houses of Parliament after the 1945 Labour election victory, with "Wot, no Tories?"<ref></ref> Trains in Austria in 1946 featured Mr. Chad along with the phrase "Wot—no Fuehrer?"<ref></ref>
As rationing became less common, so did the joke. The cartoon is occasionally seen today as "Kilroy was here",<ref name=phrases></ref> but "Chad" and his complaints have long fallen from popular use, although they continue to be seen occasionally on walls and in references in popular culture.
Chad was also thought to stand for “Can’t have a dance.”
== Smoe ==
Writing about the Kilroy phenomenon in 1946, The Milwaukee Journal describes the doodle as the European counterpart to "Kilroy was here", under the name Smoe. It also says that Smoe was called Clem in the African theater.<ref></ref> It noted that next to "Kilroy was here" was often added "And so was Smoe". While Kilroy enjoyed a resurgence of interest after the war due to radio shows and comic writers, the name Smoe had already disappeared by the end of 1946.<ref></ref> A B-24 airman writing in 1998 also noted the distinction between the character of Smoe and Kilroy (who he says was never pictured), and suggested that Smoe stood for "Sad men of Europe".<ref></ref> Correspondents to Life magazine in 1962 also insisted that Clem, Mr. Chad or Luke the Spook was the name of the figure, and that Kilroy was unpictured. The editor suggested that the names were all synonymous early in the war, then later separated into separate characters.<ref></ref>
== Other names ==
Similar drawings appear in many countries. Herbie (Canada), Overby (Los Angeles, late 1960s),<ref></ref> Flywheel, Private Snoops, The Jeep, and Clem (Canada) are alternative names.<ref name="openwriting.com" /><ref name="dope" /><ref name=polityka></ref> An advertisement in Billboard in November 1946 for plastic "Kilroys" also used the names Clem, Heffinger, Luke the Spook, Some, and Stinkie.<ref></ref> "Luke the Spook" was the name of a B-29 bomber, and its nose-art resembles the doodle and is said to have been created at the Boeing factory in Seattle.<ref></ref> In Chile, the graphic is known as a "sapo"<ref name=polityka/> (slang for nosy).
In Poland, Kilroy is replaced with "Józef Tkaczuk" or "M. Pulina".<ref name=polityka/> In Russia, the phrase "Vasya was here" is a notorious piece of graffiti.<ref></ref>

Its origin is debated, but the phrase and the distinctive accompanying doodle became associated with GIs in the 1940s: a bald-headed man (sometimes depicted as having a few hairs) with a prominent nose peeking over a wall with his fingers clutching the wall.
"Kilroy" was the American equivalent of the Australian Foo was here which originated during World War I. "Mr Chad" or just "Chad" was the version that became popular in the United Kingdom. The character of Chad may have been derived from a British cartoonist in 1938, possibly pre-dating "Kilroy was here". According to Dave Wilton, "Some time during the war, Chad and Kilroy met, and in the spirit of Allied unity merged, with the British drawing appearing over the American phrase."<ref name="openwriting.com" /> Other names for the character include Smoe, Clem, Flywheel, Private Snoops, Overby, The Jeep, and Sapo.
According to Charles Panati, "The outrageousness of the graffiti was not so much what it said, but where it turned up."<ref name="dope"></ref> It is not known if there was an actual person named Kilroy who inspired the graffiti, although there have been claims over the years.
In 1943, 32,000 employees worked at the Fore River Shipyard.
One of them was James J. Kilroy, a welding inspector.
