Outsourcing

==Terminology==
* Offshoring is moving the work to a distant country. If the distant workplace is a foreign subsidiary/owned by the company, then the offshore operation is a captive,<ref name="cap"></ref> sometimes referred to as in-house offshore.<ref name=InH.off_CIO></ref>
* is the practice of hiring an external organization to perform some business functions ("Outsourcing") in a far-off country other than the one where the products or services are actually performed, developed or manufactured ("Offshore").<ref name=Mankiw/> 
* Insourcing entails bringing processes handled by third-party firms in-house, and is sometimes accomplished via vertical integration.
* Nearshoring refers to outsource to a nearby country.
* refers to outsourcing to companies in more rural locations within the same country.<ref>also called domestic outsourcing. </ref>
* (also known as is a form of IT-enabled "transfer of service industry employment from offices to home-based . with appropriate telephone and Internet facilities".<ref></ref><ref></ref> These telecommuting positions may be customer-facing or Back office,<ref></ref> and the workers may be employees or independent contractors.
* In-housing refers to hiring employees.<ref></ref>
* An Intermediary is when a business provides a contract service to another organization while contracting out that same service.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
===Acronyms===
Some of the acronyms related to BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) are:
</ref>
* specialized expertise.<ref></ref>
* speed of execution
* short term staff augmentation<ref></ref>
While much of this work is the "bread and butter" of specialized departments within advertising agencies, sometimes specialist are used, such as when the Guardian newspaper outsourced most of their marketing design in May 2010.<ref></ref>
==Business process outsourcing==
Business process outsourcing (BPO) is a subset of outsourcing that involves the contracting of the operations and responsibilities of a specific business process to a third-party service provider. Originally, this was associated with manufacturing firms, such as Coca-Cola that outsourced large segments of its supply chain.<ref>Tas, J. & Sunder, S. 2004, Financial Services Business Process Outsourcing, Communications of the ACM, Vol 47, No. 5</ref>
BPO is typically categorized into back office and front office outsourcing.<ref></ref>
BPO can be offshore outsourcing, near-shore outsourcing to a nearby country, or onshore outsource to the same country. Information technology Enabled Service (ITES-BPO),<ref name="NellisParker2006"></ref> Knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) and Legal process outsourcing (LPO) are some of the sub-segments of BPO.
Although BPO began as a cost-reducer, changes (specifically the move to more service-based rather than product-based contracts), companies now choose to outsource their back-office increasingly for time flexibility and direct quality control.<ref>Sagoo, Anoop. urltoken "How IT is reinvigorating business process outsourcing" CIO. 6 Sep 2012. Retrieved 25 March 2013.</ref> Business process outsourcing enhances the flexibility of an organization in different ways:
BPO vendor charges are project-based or fee-for-service, using business models such as Remote In-Sourcing or similar software development and outsourcing models.<ref>BPM Watch. "In-Sourcing Remotely: A Closer Look at an Emerging Outsourcing Trend" </ref><ref></ref> This can help a company to become more flexible by transforming fixed into variable costs.<ref>Willcocks, L., Hindle, J., Feeny, D. & Lacity, M. 2004, IT and Business Process Outsourcing: The Knowledge Potential, Information Systems Management, Vol. 21, pp 7–15</ref> A variable cost structure helps a company responding to changes in required capacity and does not require a company to invest in assets, thereby making the company more flexible.<ref>Gilley, K.M., Rasheed, A. 2000. Making More by Doing Less: An Analysis of Outsourcing and its Effects on Firm Performance. Journal of Management, 26 (4): 763-790.</ref>
BPO also permits focusing on a company's core competencies.<ref>Kakabadse, A., Kakabadse. N. 2002. Trends in Outsourcing: Contrasting USA and Europe. European Management Journal Vol. 20, No. 2: 189–198</ref>
Supply chain management with effective use of supply chain partners and business process outsourcing can increase the speed of several business processes.<ref>Tas, Jeroen, Sunder, Shyam. 2004. Financial Services Business Process Outsourcing. COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM Vol. 47, No. 5</ref>
=== BPO caveats ===
Even various contractual compensation strategies may leave the company as having a new "single point of failure" (where even an after the fact payment is not enough to offset "complete failure of the customer's business").<ref></ref> Unclear contractual issues are not the only risks; there's also changing requirements and unforeseen charges, failure to meet service levels, and a dependence on the BPO which reduces flexibility. The latter is called lock-in; flexibility may be lost due to penalty clauses and other contract terms.<ref>Michel, Vaughan, Fitzgerald, Guy. 1997. The IT outsourcing market place: vendors and their selection. Journal of Information Technology 12: 223-237</ref> Also, the selection criteria may seem vague and undifferentiated<ref>Adsit, D. (2009) Will a Toyota Emerge from the Pack of Me-Too BPO's?, In Queue </ref>
Security risks can arise regarding both from physical communication and from a privacy perspective. Employee attitude may change, and the company risks losing independence.<ref>Bunmi Cynthia Adeleye, Fenio Annansingh and Miguel Baptista Nunes. "Risk management practices in IS outsourcing: an investigation into commercial banks in Nigeria", International Journal of Information Management 24 (2004): 167-180.</ref><ref>K. Altinkemer, A. Chaturvedi and R. Gulati. "Information systems outsourcing: Issues and evidence", International Journal of Information Management 14- 4 (1994): 252- 268.</ref>
Risks and threats of outsourcing must therefore be managed, to achieve any benefits. In order to manage outsourcing in a structured way, maximising positive outcome, minimising risks and avoiding any threats, a business continuity management (BCM) model is set up. BCM consists of a set of steps, to successfully identify, manage and control the business processes that are, or can be outsourced.<ref>Forbes Gibb, and Steven Buchanan. "A framework for business continuity management", International Journal of Information Management 26- 2 (2006): 128- 141.</ref>
Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is a framework of BPO focused on identifying potential outsourceable information systems.<ref>Chyan Yang and Jen-Bor Huang. "A decision model for IS outsourcing", International Journal of Information Management 20- 3 (2000): 225- 239.</ref> L. Willcocks, M. Lacity and G. Fitzgerald identify several contracting problems companies face, ranging from unclear contract formatting, to a lack of understanding of technical IT processes.<ref>L. Willcocks, M. Lacity and G. Fitzgerald. "Information technology outsourcing in Europe and the USA: Assessment issues", International Journal of Information Management 15-5 (1995): 333&ndash;351.</ref>
=== Technological pressures ===
Industry analysts have identified robotic process automation (RPA) software and in particular the enhanced self-guided RPAAI based on artificial intelligence as a potential threat to the industry<ref name="HfSThreat"></ref><ref name="GartnerPredicts2014"></ref> and speculate as to the likely long-term impact.<ref></ref> In the short term, however, there is likely to be little impact as existing contracts run their course: it is only reasonable to expect demand for cost efficiency and innovation to result in transformative changes at the point of contract renewals. With the average length of a BPO contract being 5 years or more<ref name="GartnerLength"></ref> – and many contracts being longer – this hypothesis will take some time to play out.
On the other hand, an academic study by the London School of Economics was at pains to counter the so-called "myth" that RPA will bring back many jobs from offshore.<ref name="LSEXchanging"></ref> One possible argument behind such an assertion is that new technology provides new opportunities for increased quality, reliability, scalability and cost control, thus enabling BPO providers to increasingly compete on an outcomes-based model rather than competing on cost alone. With the core offering potentially changing from a "lift and shift" approach based on fixed costs to a more qualitative, service based and outcomes-based model, there is perhaps a new opportunity to grow the BPO industry with a new offering.
=== Industry size ===
One estimate of the worldwide BPO market from the BPO Services Global Industry Almanac 2017, puts the size of the industry in 2016 at about US$140 billion.<ref name="almanac"></ref>
India, China and the Philippines are major powerhouses in the industry. In 2017, in India, the BPO industry generated US$30 billion in revenue according to the national industry association.<ref></ref> The BPO industry is a small segment of the total outsourcing industry in India. The BPO industry workforce in India is expected to shrink by 14% in 2021.<ref></ref>
The BPO industry and IT services industry in combination are worth a total of US$154 billion in revenue in 2017.<ref></ref> The BPO industry in the Philippines generated $22.9 billion in revenues in 2016,<ref></ref> while around 700 thousand medium and high skill jobs would be created by 2022.<ref></ref>
In 2015, official statistics put the size of the total outsourcing industry in China, including not only the BPO industry but also IT outsourcing services, at $130.9 billion.<ref name="itoutsourcing"></ref>
== Economic theory ==
In economic theory, the pros and cons of outsourcing have been discussed since Ronald Coase (1937) asked the famous question: Why is not all production carried on by one big firm?<ref></ref> An informal answer has been provided by Oliver Williamson (1979), who has emphasized the importance of different transaction costs within and between firms.<ref></ref> The boundaries of the firm (i.e., the distinction between transactions taking place within a firm and transactions between different firms) have been formally studied by Oliver Hart (1995) and his coauthors.<ref></ref> According to the property rights approach to the theory of the firm based on Incomplete contracts, the ownership structure (i.e., integration or non-integration) determines how the returns to non-contractible investments will be divided in future negotiations. Hence, whether or not outsourcing an activity to a different firm is optimal depends on the relative importance of the investments that the trading partners have to make. For instance, if only one party has to make an important non-contractible investment decision, then this party should be owner.<ref></ref><ref></ref> However, the conclusions of the incomplete contracting theory crucially rely on the specification of the negotiations protocol (DeMeza and Lockwood, 1998)<ref></ref> and on whether or not there is asymmetric information (Schmitz, 2006).<ref></ref>

Outsourcing is an agreement in which one company hires another company to be responsible for a planned or existing activity that is or could be done internally,<ref name="Brit.Ency103"></ref><ref></ref>
and sometimes involves transferring employees and assets from one firm to another.
The term outsourcing, which came from the phrase outside resourcing, originated no later than 1981.<ref></ref><ref>Outsource 1979, outsourcing 1981: </ref><ref>OED</ref> The concept, which The Economist says has "made its presence felt since the time of the Second World War",<ref></ref> often involves the contracting of a business process (e.g., payroll processing, claims processing), operational, and/or non-core functions, such as manufacturing, facility management, call center/call centre support).
The practice of Privatization, even if on a short-term limited basis,<ref></ref> may also be described as "outsourcing".<ref>Jamieson, Dave, urltoken "Public Interest Group Challenges Privatization Of Local, State Government Services" , The Huffington Post, July 1, 2013. Retrieved 2013-07-01</ref>
Outsourcing includes both foreign and domestic contracting,<ref name="Hira, Ron 2008">Hira, Ron, and Anil Hira. Outsourcing America: What's behind Our National Crisis and How We Can Reclaim American Jobs. New York: AMACOM, 2008.

Print.</ref> or nearshoring (transferring a business process to a nearby country).
Offshoring and outsourcing are not mutually inclusive: there can be one without the other. They can be intertwined (offshore outsourcing), and can be individually or jointly, partially or completely reversed,<ref name=DELL.back></ref> involving terms such as reshoring, inshoring, and insourcing.
