Market segmentation

== Definition and brief explanation ==
Market segmentation is the process of dividing up mass markets into groups with similar needs and wants.<ref>Pride, W., Ferrell, O.C., Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S., Niininen, O. and Cassidy, R., Marketing Principles, 3rd Asia-Pacific ed, Cengage, 2018, p. 200</ref> The rationale for market segmentation is that in order to achieve competitive advantage and superior performance, firms should: "(1) identify segments of industry demand, (2) target specific segments of demand, and (3) develop specific 'marketing mixes' for each targeted market segment. "<ref>Madhavaram, S., & Hunt, S. D., "The Service-dominant Logic and a Hierarchy of Operant Resources: Developing Masterful Operant Resources and Implications for Marketing Strategy, " Journal Of The Academy Of Marketing Science, Vol. 36, No. 1, 2008, pp 67-82.</ref> From an economic perspective, segmentation is built on the assumption that heterogeneity in demand allows for demand to be disaggregated into segments with distinct demand functions.<ref>Dickson, Peter R.; Ginter, James L., "Market Segmentation, Product Differentiation, and Marketing Strategy, " Journal of Marketing, Vol. 51, No. 2, 1987, p. 1</ref>
== History ==
The business historian, Richard S. Tedlow, identifies four stages in the evolution of market segmentation:<ref>In New and Improved: The Story of Mass Marketing in America, Basic Books, N.Y. 1990 pp. 4–12, Richard Tedlow outlines first three stages: fragmentation, unification and segmentation. In a subsequent work, published three years later, Tedlow and his co-author thought that they had seen evidence of a new trend and added a fourth era, termed Hyper-segmentation (post 1980s); See Tedlow, R.A. and Jones, G., The Rise and Fall of Mass Marketing, Routledge, N.Y., 1993, Chapter 2</ref>
* Fragmentation (pre-1880s): The economy was characterised by small regional suppliers who sold goods on a local or regional basis
* Unification or mass marketing (1880s–1920s): As transportation systems improved, the economy became unified. Standardised, branded goods were distributed at a national level. Manufacturers tended to insist on strict standardisation in order to achieve scale economies with a view to penetrating markets in the early stages of a product's lifecycle. e.g. the Model T Ford
* Segmentation (1920s–1980s): As market size increased, manufacturers were able to produce different models pitched at different quality points to meet the needs of various demographic and psychographic market segments. This is the era of market differentiation based on demographic, socio-economic, and lifestyle factors.
* Hyper-segmentation (post-1980s): a shift towards the definition of ever more narrow market segments. Technological advancements, especially in the area of digital communications, allow marketers to communicate with individual consumers or very small groups. This is sometimes known as one-to-one marketing.
The practice of market segmentation emerged well before marketers thought about it at a theoretical level.<ref>Fullerton, R., "Segmentation in Practice: An Overview of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries," in Jones, D.G.B. and Tadajewski, M. (eds), The Routledge Companion to Marketing History, Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 94</ref> Archaeological evidence suggests that Bronze Age traders segmented trade routes according to geographical circuits.<ref>Alberti, M. E., "Trade and Weighing Systems in the Southern Aegean from the Early Bronze Age to the Iron Age: How Changing Circuits Influenced Glocal Measures," in Molloy, B. (ed.), Of Odysseys and Oddities: Scales and Modes of Interaction Between Prehistoric Aegean Societies and their Neighbours, Sheffield Studies in Aegean Archaeology, Oxford, Oxbow, (E-Book), 2016</ref> Other evidence suggests that the practice of modern market segmentation was developed incrementally from the 16th century onwards. Retailers, operating outside the major metropolitan cities, could not afford to serve one type of clientele exclusively, yet retailers needed to find ways to separate the wealthier clientele from the "riff raff". One simple technique was to have a window opening out onto the street from which customers could be served. This allowed the sale of goods to the common people, without encouraging them to come inside. Another solution, that came into vogue from the late sixteenth century, was to invite favored customers into a back-room of the store, where goods were permanently on display. Yet another technique that emerged around the same time was to hold a showcase of goods in the shopkeeper's private home for the benefit of wealthier clients. Samuel Pepys, for example, writing in 1660, describes being invited to the home of a retailer to view a wooden jack.<ref>Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England, Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, pp. 155–59</ref> The eighteenth-century English entrepreneurs, Josiah Wedgewood and Matthew Boulton, both staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls to which only the upper classes were invited while Wedgewood used a team of itinerant salesmen to sell wares to the masses.<ref>McKendrick, N., Brewer, J. and Plumb, J.H., The Birth of a Consumer Society: The Commercialization of Eighteenth Century England, London, 1982.</ref>
Evidence of early marketing segmentation has also been noted elsewhere in Europe. A study of the German book trade found examples of both product differentiation and market segmentation in the 1820s.<ref>Fullerton, R.A., "Segmentation Strategies and Practices in the 19th-Century German Book Trade: A Case Study in the Development of a Major Marketing Technique", in Historical Perspectives in Consumer Research: National and International Perspectives, Jagdish N. Sheth and Chin Tiong Tan (eds), Singapore, Association for Consumer Research, pp 135-139</ref> From the 1880s, German toy manufacturers were producing models of tin toys for specific geographic markets; London omnibuses and ambulances destined for the British market; French postal delivery vans for Continental Europe and American locomotives intended for sale in America.<ref>Pressland, David, Book of Penny Toys, Pei International, 1991; Cross, G., Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood, Harvard University Press, 2009, pp 95-96</ref> Such activities suggest that basic forms of market segmentation have been practised since the 17th century and possibly earlier.
Contemporary market segmentation emerged in the first decades of the twentieth century as marketers responded to two pressing issues. Demographic and purchasing data were available for groups but rarely for individuals and secondly, advertising and distribution channels were available for groups, but rarely for single consumers. Between 1902 and 1910, George B Waldron, working at Mahin's Advertising Agency in the United States used tax registers, city directories, and census data to show advertisers the proportion of educated vs illiterate consumers and the earning capacity of different occupations, etc. in a very early example of simple market segmentation.<ref name="Jones, G.D.B 2016, p. 66">Jones, G.D.B. and Tadajewski, M. (eds), The Routledge Companion to Marketing History, Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 66</ref><ref>Lockley, L.C., "Notes on the History of Marketing Research", Journal of Marketing, Vol. 14, No. 5, 1950, pp. 733–736</ref> In 1924 Paul Cherington developed the 'ABCD' household typology; the first socio-demographic segmentation tool.<ref name="Jones, G.D.B 2016, p. 66" /><ref>Lockley, L.C., "Notes on the History of Marketing Research", Journal of Marketing, vol. 14, no. 5, 1950, p. 71</ref> By the 1930s, market researchers such as Ernest Dichter recognised that demographics alone were insufficient to explain different marketing behaviours and began exploring the use of lifestyles, attitudes, values, beliefs and culture to segment markets.<ref>Wilson B. S. and Levy, J., "A History of the Concept of Branding: Practice and Theory", Journal of Historical Research in Marketing, vol. 4, no. 3, 2012, pp. 347-368; DOI: 10.1108/17557501211252934</ref> With access to group-level data only, brand marketers approached the task from a tactical viewpoint. Thus, segmentation was essentially a brand-driven process.
Wendell R. Smith is generally credited with being the first to introduce the concept of market segmentation into the marketing literature in 1956 with the publication of his article, "Product Differentiation and Market Segmentation as Alternative Marketing Strategies."<ref>Cano, C., "The Recent Evolution of Market Segmentation Concepts and Thoughts Primarily by Marketing Academics," in E. Shaw (ed) The Romance of Marketing History, Proceedings of the 11th Conference on Historical Analysis and Research in Marketing (CHARM), Boca Raton, FL, AHRIM, 2003.</ref> Smith's article makes it clear that he had observed "many examples of segmentation" emerging and to a certain extent saw this as a "natural force" in the market that would "not be denied."<ref>Smith, W.R., "Product Differentiation and Market Segmentation as Alternative Marketing Strategies," Journal of Marketing, Vol. 21, No. 1, 1956, pp. 3–8 and reprinted in Marketing Management, vol. 4, no. 3, 1995, pp. 63–65</ref> As Schwarzkopf points out, Smith was codifying implicit knowledge that had been used in advertising and brand management since at least the 1920s.<ref>Schwarzkopf, S., "Turning Trade Marks into Brands: How Advertising Agencies Created Brands in the Global Market Place, 1900–1930" CGR Working Paper, Queen Mary University, London, 18 August 2008</ref>
Until relatively recently, most segmentation approaches have retained a tactical perspective in that they address immediate short-term decisions; such as describing the current “market served” and are concerned with informing marketing mix decisions. However, with the advent of digital communications and mass data storage, it has been possible for marketers to conceive of segmenting at the level of the individual consumer. Extensive data is now available to support segmentation at very narrow groups or even for the single customer, allowing marketers to devise a customised offer with an individual price which can be disseminated via real-time communications.<ref>Kara, A. and Kaynak, E., "Markets of a Single Customer: Exploiting Conceptual Developments in Market Segmentation", European Journal of Marketing, vol. 31, no. 11/12, 1997, pp. 873–895, DOI: urltoken Some scholars have argued that the fragmentation of markets has rendered traditional approaches to market segmentation less useful.<ref>Firat, A.F. and Shultz, C.J., "From Segmentation to Fragmentation: Markets and Marketing Strategy in the Postmodern Era," European Journal of Marketing, vol. 31 no. 3/4, 1997, pp 183-207</ref>
== Criticisms ==
The limitations of conventional segmentation have been well documented in the literature.<ref>Hoek, J., Gendall, P. and Esslemont, D., Market segmentation: A search for the Holy Grail?, Journal of Marketing Practice Applied Marketing Science, Vol. 2, no. 1, pp. 25–34, 1996</ref> Perennial criticisms include:
* That it is no better than mass marketing at building brands<ref>Addison, T. and O'Donohue, M., "Understanding the Customer’s Relationship With a Brand: The Role of Market Segmentation in Building Stronger Brands," Market Research Society Conference, London, 2001, Online: urltoken 
* That in competitive markets, segments rarely exhibit major differences in the way they use brands<ref>Kennedy, R. and Ehrenberg, A., "What’s in a brand?" Research, April, 2000, pp 30–32</ref>
* That it fails to identify sufficiently narrow clusters<ref>Bardakci, A. and Whitelock, L., "Mass-customisation in Marketing: The Consumer Perspective," Journal of Consumer Marketing vol. 20, no.5, 2003, pp. 463–479.</ref>
* Geographic/demographic segmentation is overly descriptive and lacks sufficient insights into the motivations necessary to drive communications strategy<ref>Smit, E. G. and Niejens, P. C., 2000. "Segmentation Based on Affinity for Advertising," Journal of Advertising Research, vol. 40, no. 4, 2000, pp. 35–43.</ref>
* Difficulties with market dynamics, notably the instability of segments over time<ref>Albaum, G. and Hawkins, D. I., "Geographic Mobility and Demographic and Socioeconomic Market Segmentation," Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, vol. 11, no. 2. 1983, pp. 97–114.</ref><ref>Blocker, C. P. and Flint, D. J., 2007. "Customer Segments as Moving Targets: Integrating Customer Value Dynamism into Segment Instability Logic," Industrial Market Management, vol. 36, no. 6., 2007, pp. 810–822.</ref> and structural change which leads to segment creep and membership migration as individuals move from one segment to another<ref>Board, T.

Market segmentation has many critics. But in spite of its limitations, market segmentation remains one of the enduring concepts in marketing and continues to be widely used in practice. One American study, for example, suggested that almost 60 percent of senior executives had used market segmentation in the past two years.<ref>Yankelovich, D., Meer, D. "Rediscovering Market Segmentation", Harvard Business Review vol. 84. no 2, 2006, pp. 122–13</ref>
== Market segmentation strategy ==
A key consideration for marketers is whether to segment or not to segment. Depending on company philosophy, resources, product type, or market characteristics, a business may develop an Mass marketing or differentiated approach. In an undifferentiated approach, the marketer ignores segmentation and develops a product that meets the needs of the largest number of buyers.<ref name="business dict undifferentiated">Business Dictionary Online: urltoken In a differentiated approach the firm targets one or more market segments, and develops separate offers for each segment.<ref name="business dict undifferentiated" />
In consumer marketing, it is difficult to find examples of undifferentiated approaches. Even goods such as salt and sugar, which were once treated as commodities, are now highly differentiated. Consumers can purchase a variety of salt products; cooking salt, table salt, sea salt, rock salt, kosher salt, mineral salt, herbal or vegetable salts, iodised salt, salt substitutes, and many more. Sugar also comes in many different types - cane sugar, beet sugar, raw sugar, white refined sugar, brown sugar, caster sugar, sugar lumps, icing sugar (also known as milled sugar), sugar syrup, invert sugar, and a plethora of sugar substitutes including smart sugar which is essentially a blend of pure sugar and a sugar substitute. Each of these product types is designed to meet the needs of specific market segments. Invert sugar and sugar syrups, for example, are marketed to food manufacturers where they are used in the production of conserves, chocolate, and baked goods. Sugars marketed to consumers appeal to different usage segments – refined sugar is primarily for use on the table, while caster sugar and icing sugar are primarily designed for use in home-baked goods.
==== Cultural segmentation ====
Cultural segmentation is used to classify markets according to the cultural origin. Culture is a major dimension of consumer behaviour and can be used to enhance customer insight and as a component of predictive models. Cultural segmentation enables appropriate communications to be crafted for particular cultural communities. Cultural segmentation can be applied to existing customer data to measure market penetration in key cultural segments by product, brand, channel as well as traditional measures of recency, frequency, and monetary value. These benchmarks form an important evidence-base to guide strategic direction and tactical campaign activity, allowing engagement trends to be monitored over time.<ref>Ellson, T., Culture and Positioning as Determinants of Strategy: Personality and the Business Organization, Springer, 2004</ref>
Cultural segmentation can be combined with other bases, especially geographics so that segments are mapped according to state, region, suburb, and neighborhood. This provides a geographical market view of population proportions and may be of benefit in selecting appropriately located premises, determining territory boundaries, and local marketing activities.
Census data is a valuable source of cultural data but cannot meaningfully be applied to individuals. Name analysis (onomastics) is the most reliable and efficient means of describing the cultural origin of individuals. The accuracy of using name analysis as a surrogate for cultural background in Australia is 80–85%, after allowing for female name changes due to marriage, social or political reasons, or colonial influence. The extent of name data coverage means a user will code a minimum of 99 percent of individuals with their most likely ancestral origin.
==== Online customer segmentation ====
Online market segmentation is similar to the traditional approaches in that the segments should be identifiable, substantial, accessible, stable, differentiable, and actionable.<ref>Gretchen Gavett, July 09/2014, What You Need to Know About Segmentation, Harvard Business Review, accessed online 3/04/2017: urltoken Customer data stored in online data management systems such as a CRM or DMP enables the analysis and segmentation of consumers across a diverse set of attributes.<ref></ref> Forsyth et al., in an article 'Internet research' grouped current active online consumers into six groups: Simplifiers, Surfers, Bargainers, Connectors, Routiners, and Sportsters. The segments differ regarding four customers' behaviours, namely:<ref>Forsyth, John E.; Lavoie, Johanne; McGuire, Tim. Segmenting the e-market. McKinsey Quarterly. 2000, Issue 4, p14-18. 5p.</ref>
* The amount of time they actively spend online,
* The number of pages and sites they access,
* The time they spend actively viewing each page,
* And the kinds of sites they visit.
For example, Simplifiers make over 50 percent of all online transactions. Their main characteristic is that they need easy (one-click) access to information and products as well as easy and quickly available service regarding products. Amazon.com is an example of a company that created an online environment for Simplifiers. They also 'dislike unsolicited e-mail, uninviting chat rooms, pop-up windows intended to encourage impulse buys, and other features that complicate their on- and off-line experience'. Surfers like to spend a lot of time online, thus companies must have a variety of products to offer and constant update, Bargainers are looking for the best price, Connectors like to relate to others, Routiners want content and Sportsters like sport and entertainment sites.
== Selecting target markets ==
Another major decision in developing the segmentation strategy is the selection of market segments that will become the focus of special attention (known as target markets). The marketer faces a number of important decisions:
* What criteria should be used to evaluate markets?
* How many markets to enter (one, two or more)?
* Which market segments are the most valuable?
When a marketer enters more than one market, the segments are often labeled the primary target market, secondary target market. The primary market is the target market selected as the main focus of marketing activities. The secondary target market is likely to be a segment that is not as large as the primary market, but has growth potential. Alternatively, the secondary target group might consist of a small number of purchasers that account for a relatively high proportion of sales volume perhaps due to purchase value or purchase frequency.
In terms of evaluating markets, three core considerations are essential:<ref>Marketing Insider, "Evaluating Market Segments", Online: urltoken </ref>
* Segment size and growth
* Segment structural attractiveness
* Company objectives and resources.
=== Criteria for evaluating segment attractiveness ===
There are no formulas for evaluating the attractiveness of market segments and a good deal of judgment must be exercised.<ref>Applbaum, K., The Marketing Era: From Professional Practice to Global Provisioning, Routledge, 2004, p. 33-35</ref> Nevertheless, a number of considerations can be used to assist in evaluating market segments for overall attractiveness. The following lists a series of questions that can be asked.
==== Segment size and growth ====
* How large is the market?
* Is the market segment substantial enough to be profitable? (Segment size can be measured in the number of customers, but superior measures are likely to include sales value or volume)
* Is the market segment growing or contracting?
* What are the indications that growth will be sustained in the long term? Is any observed growth sustainable?
* Is the segment stable over time? (Segment must have sufficient time to reach desired performance level)
==== Segment structural attractiveness ====
* To what extent are competitors targeting this market segment?
* Do buyers have bargaining power in the market?
* Are substitute products available?
* Can we carve out a viable position to differentiate from any competitors?
* How responsive are members of the market segment to the marketing program?
* Is this market segment reachable and accessible? (i.e., with respect to distribution and promotion)
==== Company objectives and resources ====
* Is this market segment aligned with our company's operating philosophy?
* Do we have the resources necessary to enter this market segment?
* Do we have prior experience with this market segment or similar market segments?
* Do we have the skills and/or know-how to enter this market segment successfully?
== Developing the marketing program and positioning strategy ==
When the segments have been determined and separate offers developed for each of the core segments, the marketer's next task is to design a marketing program (also known as the marketing mix) that will resonate with the target market or markets. Developing the marketing program requires a deep knowledge of key market segment's purchasing habits, their preferred retail outlet, their media habits, and their price sensitivity. The marketing program for each brand or product should be based on the understanding of the target market (or target markets) revealed in the market profile.
Positioning is the final step in the S-T-P planning approach; Segmentation → Targeting → Positioning; a core framework for developing marketing plans and setting objectives. Positioning refers to decisions about how to present the offer in a way that resonates with the target market. During the research and analysis that forms the central part of segmentation and targeting, the marketer will have gained insights into what motivates consumers to purchase a product or brand. These insights will form part of the positioning strategy.
According to advertising guru, David Ogilvy, "Positioning is the act of designing the company’s offering and image to occupy a distinctive place in the minds of the target market. The goal is to locate the brand in the minds of consumers to maximise the potential benefit to the firm. A good brand positioning helps guide marketing strategy by clarifying the brand’s essence, what goals it helps the consumer achieve, and how it does so in a unique way."<ref></ref>
The technique known as perceptual mapping is often used to understand consumers' mental representations of brands within a given category. Traditionally two variables (often, but not necessarily, price and quality) are used to construct the map. A sample of people in the target market are asked to explain where they would place various brands in terms of the selected variables. Results are averaged across all respondents, and results are plotted on a graph, as illustrated in the figure. The final map indicates how the average member of the population views the brand that makes up a category and how each of the brands relates to other brands within the same category. While perceptual maps with two dimensions are common, multi-dimensional maps are also used.
There are a number of different approaches to positioning:<ref>Based on Belch, G., Belch, M.A, Kerr, G. and Powell, I., Advertising and Promotion Management: An Integrated Marketing Communication Perspective, McGraw-Hill, Sydney, Australia, 2009, pp. 205–206</ref>
# Against a competitor
# Within a category
# According to product benefit
# According to product attribute
# For usage occasion
# Along price lines e.g. a luxury brand or premium brand
# For a user
# Cultural symbols e.g. Australia's Easter Bilby (as a culturally appropriate alternative to the Easter Bunny).
== Basis for segmenting business markets ==
Segmenting business markets is more straightforward than segmenting consumer markets. Businesses may be segmented according to industry, business size, business location, turnover, number of employees, company technology, purchasing approach, or any other relevant variables.<ref>Shapiro, B.P. and Bonoma, T.V., "How to Segment Industrial Markets," Harvard Business Review, May 1984, Online: urltoken The most widely used segmentation bases used in business to business markets are geographics and firmographics.<ref name="Weinstein, A. 2013">Weinstein, A., Handbook of Market Segmentation: Strategic Targeting for Business and Technology Firms, 3rd ed., Routledge, 2013, Chapter 4</ref>
The most widely used bases for segmenting business markets are:
: Geographic segmentation occurs when a firm seeks to identify the most promising geographic markets to enter. Business can tap into business census type products published by Government departments to identify geographic regions that meet certain predefined criteria.
: Firmographics (also known as emporographics or feature based segmentation) is the business community's answer to demographic segmentation. It is commonly used in business-to-business markets (an estimated 81% of B2B marketers use this technique). Under this approach the target market is segmented based on features such as company size, industry sector or location usage rate, purchase frequency, number of years in business, ownership factors and buying situation.<ref></ref><ref name="Weinstein, A. 2013"/>
:: Key firmographic variables: standard industry classification (SIC); company size (either in terms of revenue or number of employees), industry sector or location (country and/or region), usage rate, purchase frequency, number of years in business, ownership factors and buying situation
== Use in customer retention ==
The basic approach to retention-based segmentation is that a company tags each of its active customers on four axes:
; Risk of customer cancellation of company service
: One of the most common indicators of high-risk customers is a drop off in usage of the company's service. For example, in the credit card industry, this could be signaled through a customer's decline in spending on his or her card.
; Risk of customer switching to a competitor
: Many times customers move purchase preferences to a competitor brand. This may happen for many reasons those of which can be more difficult to measure. It is many times beneficial for the former company to gain meaningful insights, through data analysis, as to why this change of preference has occurred. Such insights can lead to effective strategies for winning back the customer or on how not to lose the target customer in the first place.
; Customer retention worthiness
: This determination boils down to whether the post-retention profit generated from the customer is predicted to be greater than the cost incurred to retain the customer and includes evaluation of customer lifecycles.<ref>Gupta, Sunil. Lehmann, Donald R. Managing Customers as Investments: The Strategic Value of Customers in the Long Run, pp. 70–77 (“Customer Retention” section). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education/Wharton School Publishing, 2005. </ref><ref>Goldstein, Doug. urltoken “What is Customer Segmentation?” MindofMarketing.net, May 2007. New York, NY.</ref>
This analysis of customer lifecycles is usually included in the growth plan of a business to determine which tactics to implement to retain or let go of customers.<ref></ref> Tactics commonly used range from providing special customer discounts to sending customers communications that reinforce the value proposition of the given service.
== Segmentation: algorithms and approaches ==
The choice of an appropriate statistical method for the segmentation depends on a number of factors including, the broad approach (a-priori or post-hoc), the availability of data, time constraints, the marketer's skill level, and resources.<ref>Myers, J.H., Segmentation and Positioning for Strategic Marketing Decisions, American Marketing Association, 1996</ref>
=== A-priori segmentation ===
A priori research occurs when "a theoretical framework is developed before the research is conducted".<ref>Market Research Association, Glossary of Terms, Online: urltoken In other words, the marketer has an idea about whether to segment the market geographically, demographically, psychographically or behaviourally before undertaking any research. For example, a marketer might want to learn more about the motivations and demographics of light and moderate users in an effort to understand what tactics could be used to increase usage rates. In this case, the target variable is known – the marketer has already segmented using a behavioural variable – user status. The next step would be to collect and analyze attitudinal data for light and moderate users. The typical analysis includes simple cross-tabulations, frequency distributions and occasionally logistic regression or one of a number of proprietary methods.<ref>Wedel, M. and Kamakura, W.A., Market Segmentation: Conceptual and Methodological Foundations, Springer Science & Business Media, 2010, pp 22-23.</ref>
The main disadvantage of a-priori segmentation is that it does not explore other opportunities to identify market segments that could be more meaningful.
=== Post-hoc segmentation ===
In contrast, post-hoc segmentation makes no assumptions about the optimal theoretical framework. Instead, the analyst's role is to determine the segments that are the most meaningful for a given marketing problem or situation. In this approach, the empirical data drives the segmentation selection. Analysts typically employ some type of clustering analysis or structural equation modeling to identify segments within the data. Post-hoc segmentation relies on access to rich datasets, usually with a very large number of cases and uses sophisticated algorithms to identify segments.<ref>Wedel, M. and Kamakura, W.A., Market Segmentation: Conceptual and Methodological Foundations, Springer Science & Business Media, 2010, pp 24-26.</ref>
The figure alongside illustrates how segments might be formed using clustering; however, note that this diagram only uses two variables, while in practice clustering employs a large number of variables.<ref>Constantin, C., "Post-hoc Segmentation using Marketing Research," Economics, Vol 12, no 3, 2012, pp. 39–48.</ref> 
=== Statistical techniques used in segmentation ===
Marketers often engage commercial research firms or consultancies to carry out segmentation analysis, especially if they lack the statistical skills to undertake the analysis. Some segmentation, especially post-hoc analysis, relies on sophisticated statistical analysis.
Common statistical approaches and techniques used in segmentation analysis include:
* Clustering algorithms<ref> urltoken Cluster Analysis and Segmentation, Online: inseaddataanalytics.github.io/INSEADAnalytics/Report_s45.html with worked example</ref> – overlapping, non-overlapping and fuzzy methods; e.g. K-means or other Cluster analysis
* Conjoint analysis<ref>Desarbo, W.S., Ramaswamy, V. and Cohen, S. H., "Market segmentation with choice-based conjoint analysis," Marketing Letters, vol. 6, no. 2 pp. 137–147.</ref>
* Ensemble approaches – such as random forests<ref>Perbert, F., Stenger, B. and Maki, A., "Random Forest Clustering and Application to Video Segmentation," Research Paper, Toshiba Europe, 2009, Online: urltoken 
* Chi-square automatic interaction detection – a type of decision-tree<ref>Dell Software, Statistics Textbook, Online: urltoken </ref>
* Factor analysis or principal components analysis<ref>Minhas, R.S. and Jacobs, E.M., "Benefit Segmentation by Factor Analysis: An improved method of targeting customers for financial services", International Journal of Bank Marketing, Vol. 14, no. 3, pp. 3–13.</ref>
* Latent class model – a generic term for a class of methods that attempt to detect underlying clusters based on observed patterns of association<ref>Wedel, M. and Kamakura, W.A., Market Segmentation: Conceptual and Methodological Foundations, Springer Science & Business Media, 2010, p. 21.</ref>
* Logistic regression<ref>Burinskiene, M. and Rudzkiene, V., "Application of Logit Regression Models for the Identification of Market Segments", Journal of Business Economics and Management, vol. 8, no. 4, 2008, pp. 253–258.</ref>
* Multidimensional scaling and canonical analysis<ref>T.P. Beane and D.M. Ennis, "Market Segmentation: A Review", European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 21 no. 5, pp. 20–42.</ref>
* Mixture models – e.g., EM estimation algorithm, finite-mixture models<ref>Green, P.E., Carmone, F.J. and Wachspress, D.P., Consumer Segmentation Via Latent Class Analysis, Journal of Consumer Research, December, 1976, pp. 170–174, DOI: urltoken 
* Model-based segmentation using simultaneous and structural equation modeling<ref>Swait, J., "A structural equation model of latent segmentation and product choice for cross-sectional revealed preference choice data," Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, Vol. 1, no. 2, 1994, pp. 77–89.</ref> e.g. LISREL
* Other algorithms such as artificial neural networks.<ref>Kelly E Fish, K.E., Barnes, J.H. and Aiken, M.W., "Artificial neural networks: A new methodology for industrial market segmentation," Industrial Marketing Management, Vol. 24, no. 5, 1995, pp. 431–438.</ref>
=== Data sources used for segmentation ===
Marketers use a variety of data sources for segmentation studies and market profiling. Typical sources of information include:<ref>US Government, Small Business Administration, Online: urltoken C., "Big Data: 33 Brilliant and Ad Free Data Sources for 2016," Forbes, 12 February 2016, Online: urltoken

* Customer transaction records e.g. sale value per transaction, purchase frequency
* Patron membership records e.g. active members, lapsed members, length of membership
* Customer relationship management (CRM) databases
* In-house surveys

Market segmentation is a process of dividing a heterogeneous market into relatively more homogenous segments based on certain parameters like geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioural. 
It is the activity of dividing a broad consumer or business market, normally consisting of existing and potential customers, into sub-groups of consumers (known as segments) based on some type of shared characteristics.
In dividing or segmenting markets, researchers typically look for common characteristics such as shared needs, common interests, similar lifestyles, or even similar demographic profiles. The overall aim of segmentation is to identify high yield segments – that is, those segments that are likely to be the most profitable or that have growth potential – so that these can be selected for special attention (i.e. become target markets). Many different ways to segment a market have been identified. Business-to-business (B2B) sellers might segment the market into different types of businesses or country. While business-to-consumer (B2C) sellers might segment the market into demographic segments, lifestyle segments, behavioural segments, or any other meaningful segment.
Market segmentation assumes that different market segments require different marketing programs – that is, different offers, prices, promotion, distribution, or some combination of marketing variables. Market segmentation is not only designed to identify the most profitable segments, but also to develop profiles of key segments in order to better understand their needs and purchase motivations. Insights from segmentation analysis are subsequently used to support marketing strategy development and planning. Many marketers use the S-T-P approach; Segmentation → Targeting → Positioning to provide the framework for marketing planning objectives. That is, a market is segmented, one or more segments are selected for targeting, and products or services are positioned in a way that resonates with the selected target market or markets.
