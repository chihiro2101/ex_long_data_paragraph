Negative resistance

==Definitions==
The resistance between two terminals of an electrical device or circuit is determined by its current–voltage (I–V) curve (characteristic curve), giving the current <math>i\,</math> through it for any given voltage <math>v\,</math> across it.<ref name="Herrick"></ref> Most materials, including the ordinary (positive) resistances encountered in electrical circuits, obey Ohm's law; the current through them is proportional to the voltage over a wide range.<ref name="Shanefield" /> So the I–V curve of an ohmic resistance is a straight line through the origin with positive slope. The resistance is the ratio of voltage to current, the inverse slope of the line (in I–V graphs where the voltage <math>v\,</math> is the independent variable) and is constant.
Negative resistance occurs in a few nonlinear (nonohmic) devices.<ref name="Haisch"></ref> In a nonlinear component the I–V curve is not a straight line,<ref name="Shanefield" /><ref name="Simpson"></ref> so it does not obey Ohm's law.<ref name="Haisch" /> Resistance can still be defined, but the resistance is not constant; it varies with the voltage or current through the device.<ref name="Aluf"> This source uses the term "absolute negative differential resistance" to refer to active resistance</ref><ref name="Haisch" /> The resistance of such a nonlinear device can be defined in two ways,<ref name="Simpson" /><ref name="Lesurf"></ref><ref name="Kaiser"></ref> which are equal for ohmic resistances:<ref name="Simin">, pp. 18–19,</ref>
*Static resistance (also called chordal resistance, absolute resistance or just resistance) – This is the common definition of resistance; the voltage divided by the current:<ref name="Aluf" /><ref name="Herrick" /><ref name="Simin" />
::<math>R_\mathrm</math> approaches the point of oscillation at <math>r</math>.<ref name="Button" /> This is a characteristic of all NR amplifiers,<ref name="Willardson" /> contrasting with the behavior of two-port amplifiers, which generally have limited gain but are often unconditionally stable. In practice the gain is limited by the backward "leakage" coupling between circulator ports.
Masers and parametric amplifiers are extremely low noise NR amplifiers that are also implemented as reflection amplifiers; they are used in applications like radio telescopes.<ref name="Linkhart" />
==Switching circuits==
Negative differential resistance devices are also used in switching circuits in which the device operates nonlinearly, changing abruptly from one state to another, with hysteresis.<ref name="Kumar2" /> The advantage of using a negative resistance device is that a relaxation oscillator, flip-flop or memory cell can be built with a single active device,<ref name="Abraham" /> whereas the standard logic circuit for these functions, the multivibrator, requires two active devices (transistors). Three switching circuits built with negative resistances are
*Astable multivibrator – a circuit with two unstable states, in which the output periodically switches back and forth between the states. The time it remains in each state is determined by the time constant of an RC circuit. Therefore, it is a relaxation oscillator, and can produce square waves or triangle waves.
*Monostable multivibrator – is a circuit with one unstable state and one stable state. When in its stable state a pulse is applied to the input, the output switches to its other state and remains in it for a period of time dependent on the time constant of the RC circuit, then switches back to the stable state. Thus the monostable can be used as a timer or delay element.
*Bistable multivibrator or flip flop – is a circuit with two stable states. A pulse at the input switches the circuit to its other state. Therefore, bistables can be used as memory circuits, and digital counters.
==Other applications==
===Neuronal models===
Some instances of neurons display regions of negative slope conductances (RNSC) in voltage-clamp experiments.<ref name="MacLean"></ref> The negative resistance here is implied were one to consider the neuron a typical Hodgkin–Huxley style circuit model.
==History==
Negative resistance was first recognized during investigations of electric arcs, which were used for lighting during the 19th century.<ref name="Hong"></ref> In 1881 Alfred Niaudet<ref>A. Niaudet, La Lumiere Electrique, No. 3, 1881, p. 287, cited in Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th Ed., Vol. 16, p. 660</ref> had observed that the voltage across arc electrodes decreased temporarily as the arc current increased, but many researchers thought this was a secondary effect due to temperature.<ref name="Britannica" /> The term "negative resistance" was applied by some to this effect, but the term was controversial because it was known that the resistance of a passive device could not be negative.<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Britannica">Emile Garcke, </ref><ref name="Heaviside">, also see letter by Andrew Gray on same page</ref> Beginning in 1895 Hertha Ayrton, extending her husband William's research with a series of meticulous experiments measuring the I–V curve of arcs, established that the curve had regions of negative slope, igniting controversy.<ref name="Ayrton"></ref><ref name="Britannica" /><ref name="Gethemann"></ref> Frith and Rodgers in 1896<ref name="Britannica" /><ref name="Frith"></ref> with the support of the Ayrtons<ref name="Ayrton" /> introduced the concept of differential resistance, dv/di, and it was slowly accepted that arcs had negative differential resistance. In recognition of her research, Hertha Ayrton became the first woman voted for induction into the Institute of Electrical Engineers.<ref name="Gethemann" />
===Arc transmitters===
George Francis FitzGerald first realized in 1892 that if the damping resistance in a resonant circuit could be made zero or negative, it would produce continuous oscillations.<ref name="Hong" /><ref name="Fitzgerald">G. Fitzgerald, On the Driving of Electromagnetic Vibrations by Electromagnetic and Electrostatic Engines, read at the January 22, 1892 meeting of the Physical Society of London, in </ref> In the same year Elihu Thomson built a negative resistance oscillator by connecting an LC circuit to the electrodes of an arc,<ref name="Nahin"></ref><ref name="Morse"></ref> perhaps the first example of an electronic oscillator. William Duddell, a student of Ayrton at London Central Technical College, brought Thomson's arc oscillator to public attention.<ref name="Nahin" /><ref name="Hong" /><ref name="Gethemann" /> Due to its negative resistance, the current through an arc was unstable, and arc lamp would often produce hissing, humming, or even howling noises. In 1899, investigating this effect, Duddell connected an LC circuit across an arc and the negative resistance excited oscillations in the tuned circuit, producing a musical tone from the arc.<ref name="Nahin" /><ref name="Hong" /><ref name="Gethemann" /> To demonstrate his invention Duddell wired several tuned circuits to an arc and played a tune on it.<ref name="Hong" /><ref name="Gethemann" /> Duddell's "singing arc" oscillator was limited to audio frequencies.<ref name="Nahin" /> However, in 1903 Danish engineers Valdemar Poulsen and P. O. Pederson increased the frequency into the radio range by operating the arc in a hydrogen atmosphere in a magnetic field,<ref name="Poulsen"></ref> inventing the Poulsen arc radio transmitter, which was widely used until the 1920s.<ref name="Nahin" /><ref name="Hong" />
===Vacuum tubes===
By the early 20th century, although the physical causes of negative resistance were not understood, engineers knew it could generate oscillations and had begun to apply it.<ref name="Hong" /> Heinrich Barkhausen in 1907 showed that oscillators must have negative resistance.<ref name="Duncan" /> Ernst Ruhmer and Adolf Pieper discovered that mercury vapor lamps could produce oscillations, and by 1912 AT&T had used them to build amplifying repeaters for telephone lines.<ref name="Hong" />
In 1918 Albert Hull at GE discovered that vacuum tubes could have negative resistance in parts of their operating ranges, due to a phenomenon called secondary emission.<ref name="Gottlieb" /><ref name="Butler" /><ref name="Hull"></ref> In a vacuum tube when electrons strike the plate electrode they can knock additional electrons out of the surface into the tube. This represents a current away from the plate, reducing the plate current.<ref name="Gottlieb" /> Under certain conditions increasing the plate voltage causes a decrease in plate current. By connecting an LC circuit to the tube Hull created an oscillator, the dynatron oscillator. Other negative resistance tube oscillators followed, such as the biotron invented by John Scott-Taggart in 2019,<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> and the magnetron invented by Hull in 1920.<ref name="Gilmour" />
The negative impedance converter originated from work by Marius Latour around 1920.<ref name="Latour"></ref><ref name=" Merrill"></ref> He was also one of the first to report negative capacitance and inductance.<ref name="Latour" /> A decade later, vacuum tube NICs were developed as telephone line repeaters at Bell Labs by George Crisson and others,<ref name="Crisson" /><ref name="Hansen" /> which made transcontinental telephone service possible.<ref name="Hansen" /> Transistor NICs, pioneered by Linvill in 1953, initiated a great increase in interest in NICs and many new circuits and applications developed.<ref name="Linvill" /><ref name="Hansen" />
===Solid state devices===
Negative differential resistance in semiconductors was observed around 1909 in the first point-contact junction diodes, called cat's whisker detectors, by researchers such as William Henry Eccles<ref name="Grebennikov"></ref><ref name="Pickard"></ref> and G. W. Pickard.<ref name="Pickard" /><ref name="White"></ref> They noticed that when junctions were biased with a DC voltage to improve their sensitivity as radio detectors, they would sometimes break into spontaneous oscillations.<ref name="White" /> However the effect was not pursued.
The first person to exploit negative resistance diodes practically was Russian radio researcher Oleg Losev, who in 1922 discovered negative differential resistance in biased zincite (zinc oxide) point contact junctions.<ref name="White" /><ref name="Losev"></ref><ref name="Gabel"></ref><ref name="Ben-Menahem"></ref><ref name="Lee2"> urltoken Lee, Thomas H. (2004) The Design of CMOS Radio-Frequency Integrated Circuits, 2nd Ed., p. 20</ref> He used these to build solid-state amplifiers, oscillators, and amplifying and regenerative radio receivers, 25 years before the invention of the transistor.<ref name="Grebennikov" /><ref name="Gabel" /><ref name="Lee2" /><ref name="Gernsback"> and " urltoken The Crystodyne Principle ", pp. 294–295</ref> Later he even built a superheterodyne receiver.<ref name="Lee2" /> However his achievements were overlooked because of the success of vacuum tube technology. After ten years he abandoned research into this technology (dubbed "Crystodyne" by Hugo Gernsback),<ref name="Gernsback" /> and it was forgotten.<ref name="Lee2" />
The first widely used solid-state negative resistance device was the tunnel diode, invented in 1957 by Japanese physicist Leo Esaki.<ref name="Franz" /><ref name="Esaki"></ref> Because they have lower parasitic capacitance than vacuum tubes due to their small junction size, diodes can function at higher frequencies, and tunnel diode oscillators proved able to produce power at microwave frequencies, above the range of ordinary vacuum tube oscillators. Its invention set off a search for other negative resistance semiconductor devices for use as microwave oscillators,<ref name="Ridley"></ref> resulting in the discovery of the IMPATT diode, Gunn diode, TRAPATT diode, and others. In 1969 Kurokawa derived conditions for stability in negative resistance circuits.<ref name="Kurokawa" /> Currently negative differential resistance diode oscillators are the most widely used sources of microwave energy,<ref name="Du" /> and many new negative resistance devices have been discovered in recent decades.<ref name="Franz" />

In electronics, negative resistance (NR) is a property of some electrical circuits and devices in which an increase in voltage across the device's terminals results in a decrease in electric current through it.<ref name="Amos"></ref><ref name="Graf"></ref>
This is in contrast to an ordinary resistor in which an increase of applied voltage causes a proportional increase in current due to Ohm's law, resulting in a positive resistance.<ref name="Shanefield"></ref> While a positive resistance consumes power from current passing through it, a negative resistance produces power.<ref name="Carr" /><ref name="Groszkowski"></ref> Under certain conditions it can increase the power of an electrical signal, amplifier it.<ref name="Aluf" /><ref name="Gottlieb"></ref><ref name="Kaplan"></ref>
Negative resistance is an uncommon property which occurs in a few nonlinear electronic components. In a nonlinear device, two types of resistance can be defined: 'static' or 'absolute resistance', the ratio of voltage to current <math>v/i\,</math>, and differential resistance, the ratio of a change in voltage to the resulting change in current <math>\Delta v/\Delta i</math>. The term negative resistance means negative differential resistance (NDR), <math>\Delta v/\Delta i\;<\;0</math>. In general, a negative differential resistance is a two-terminal component which can amplify,<ref name="Aluf" /><ref name="Suzuki">"In semiconductor physics, it is known that if a two-terminal device shows negative differential resistance it can amplify." </ref> converting DC power applied to its terminals to AC output power to amplify an AC signal applied to the same terminals.<ref name="Carr"></ref><ref name="Iniewski" /> They are used in electronic oscillators and amplifiers,<ref name="Shahinpoor"></ref> particularly at microwave frequencies. Most microwave energy is produced with negative differential resistance devices.<ref name="Golio"></ref> They can also have hysteresis<ref name="Kumar2"></ref> and be bistable, and so are used in switching and memory circuits.<ref name="Beneking"></ref> Examples of devices with negative differential resistance are tunnel diodes, Gunn diodes, and gas discharge tubes such as neon lamps, and fluorescent lights. In addition, circuits containing amplifying devices such as transistors and op amps with positive feedback can have negative differential resistance. These are used in oscillators and active filters.
Because they are nonlinear, negative resistance devices have a more complicated behavior than the positive "ohmic" resistances usually encountered in electric circuits. Unlike most positive resistances, negative resistance varies depending on the voltage or current applied to the device, and negative resistance devices can only have negative resistance over a limited portion of their voltage or current range.<ref name="Kaplan" /><ref name="Gilmore" /> Therefore, there is no real "negative resistor" analogous to a positive resistor, which has a constant negative resistance over an arbitrarily wide range of current.
