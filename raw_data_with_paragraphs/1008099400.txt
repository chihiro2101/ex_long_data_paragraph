Pamela Stephenson

== Early life ==
Pamela Helen Stephenson was born on 4 December 1949 in Takapuna, Auckland. In 1953, she moved to Australia with her scientist parents and two brothers. She attended Boronia Park Primary School in Sydney and then Sydney Church of England Girls' Grammar School, Darlinghurst.
According to her own autobiography, Stephenson was raped at age 16 while she was living in Australia by a 35-year-old heroin addict, contracting an STD as consequence.<ref></ref> She concealed the fact but was expelled from her home by her parents once her medical condition was known: "I remember the feeling well, because I still experience it every time someone rejects me, even in some relatively small way."<ref></ref>
== Comedy and acting ==
Stephenson had begun acting on television by 1972. She starred during 1973–74 as Julie King in the Australian TV series Ryan. She made numerous television and film appearances, including as Michelle Osgood in the Space: 1999 episode "Catacombs of the Moon" (1976),<ref></ref> Josephine in the 1977 ABC production of Malcolm Williamson's opera The Violins of Saint-Jacques, and Wendy in the 1977 New Avengers episode "Angels of Death". She had another recurring role as Iris Reade in the UK series Funny Man (1981). She made a TV comedy sketch show pilot, Stephenson's Rocket, which was not taken up.<ref></ref> Among her first appearances in the UK, she joined the live on-stage team at The Comic Strip led by Rik Mayall, Peter Richardson and Alexei Sayle at the Raymond Revuebar in Soho. This was not a happy experience, according to an interview she gave in 2014: "Doing stand-up was like a war with everyone playing this game of "I can be funnier than you".<ref></ref><ref></ref>
Probably her most widely recognised television role was in the 1980s UK comedy television sketch show Not The Nine O'Clock News, alongside Rowan Atkinson, Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones (1979–82). Her parodies included Kate Bush in a song called "Oh England, My Leotard" (referencing "Oh England My Lionheart"), and Olivia Newton-John in a song called "Typical Bloody Typical" (referencing "Physical"). She also had a small part in three episodes of the British TV police drama series The Professionals. Her personal contribution as a comedian added to the success of Not the Nine O'Clock News, and led to a collaboration with comedy and satire writers Mike Lepine and Mark Leigh. This spawned a book, How To Be A Complete Bitch, and a board game. In 1982–83, she starred in the West End production of Joseph Papp's version of The Pirates of Penzance.<ref>Theatre Record, 19 May 1982 to 2 June 1982, p. 278</ref><ref>Shane, Emma. urltoken The Pirates of Penzance .
