National security

== Definitions ==
The concept of national security remains ambiguous, having evolved from simpler definitions which emphasised freedom from military threat and from political coercion.<ref name="Romm 1993"></ref><ref name="Paleri"></ref> Among the many definitions proposed to date are the following, which show how the concept has evolved to encompass non-military concerns:
* "A nation has security when it does not have to sacrifice its legitimate ínterests to avoid war, and is able, if challenged, to maintain them by war." (Walter Lippmann, 1943).<ref name="Romm 1993" />
* "The distinctive meaning of national security means freedom from foreign dictation." (Harold Lasswell, 1950)<ref name="Romm 1993" />
* "National security objectively means the absence of threats to acquired values and subjectively, the absence of fear that such values will be attacked." (Arnold Wolfers, 1960)<ref name="auto">Quoted in Paleri (2008) ibid. Pg 52.</ref>
* "National security then is the ability to preserve the nation's physical integrity and territory; to maintain its economic relations with the rest of the world on reasonable terms; to preserve its nature, institution, and governance from disruption from outside; and to control its borders." (Harold Brown, U.S. Secretary of Defense, 1977–1981)<ref name="books.google.com">Brown, Harold (1983) Thinking about national security: defense and foreign policy in a dangerous world. As quoted in </ref>
* "National security. is best described as a capacity to control those domestic and foreign conditions that the public opinion of a given community believes necessary to enjoy its own self-determination or autonomy, prosperity, and wellbeing." (Charles Maier, 1990)<ref name="MacArthur Fellowship Program 1990. p.5"> Peace and security for the 1990s. Unpublished paper for the MacArthur Fellowship Program, Social Science Research Council, 12 Jun 1990. As quoted in Romm 1993, p.5</ref>
* "National security is an appropriate and aggressive blend of political resilience and maturity, human resources, economic structure and capacity, technological competence, industrial base and availability of natural resources and finally the military might." (National Defence College, India, 1996)<ref name="auto1">Definition from "Proceedings of Seminar on "A Maritime Strategy for India" (1996). National Defence College, Tees January Marg, New Delhi, India. quoted in Paleri 2008 (ibid).</ref>
* "National security is the measurable state of the capability of a nation to overcome the multi-dimensional threats to the apparent well-being of its people and its survival as a nation-state at any given time, by balancing all instruments of state policy through governance. and is extendable to global security by variables external to it." (Prabhakaran Paleri, 2008)<ref name="Paleri" />
* "National and international security may be understood as shared freedom from fear and want, and the freedom to live in dignity. It implies social and ecological health rather than the absence of risk. and is a common right." (Ammerdown Group, 2016)<ref name=":2"></ref>
== Dimensions of national security ==
Potential causes of national insecurity include actions by other states (e.g. military or Cyberattack), violent non-state actors (e.g. Terrorism), Organized crime such as narcotic cartels, and also the effects of natural disasters (e.g. flooding, earthquakes).<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0"></ref> Systemic drivers of insecurity, which may be transnational, include global warming, economic inequality and marginalisation, Social exclusion, and Militarization.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0" />
In view of the wide range of risks, the security of a nation state has several dimensions, including economic security, energy security, Military security, environmental security, food security, border guard, and cyber security. These dimensions correlate closely with elements of national power.
Increasingly, governments organise their security policies into a national security strategy (NSS); as of 2017, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States are among the states to have done so.<ref name=":1"></ref><ref name=":7" /><ref name=":3"></ref><ref name=":4"></ref> Some states also appoint a National Security Council and/or a National Security Advisor which is an executive government agency, it feeds the head of the state on topics concerning national security and strategic interest. The national security council/advisor strategies long term, short term, contingency national security plans. India holds one such system in current, which was established on 19 November 1998.
Although states differ in their approach, with some beginning to prioritise non-military action to tackle systemic drivers of insecurity, various forms of coercive power predominate, particularly Military Capabilities.<ref name=":2" /> The scope of these capabilities has developed. Traditionally, military capabilities were mainly land- or sea-based, and in smaller countries, they still are. Elsewhere, the domains of potential warfare now include the air, space, cyberspace, and Psychological warfare.<ref name=":6"></ref> Military capabilities designed for these domains may be used for national security, or equally for offensive purposes, for example to conquer and annex territory and resources.
=== Physical security ===
In practice, national security is associated primarily with managing physical threats and with the military capabilities used for doing so.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /> That is, national security is often understood as the capacity of a nation to mobilise military forces to guarantee its borders and to deter or successfully defend against physical threats including military aggression and attacks by non-state actors, such as terrorism. Most states, such as South Africa and Sweden,<ref></ref><ref name=":7"></ref> configure their military forces mainly for territorial defence; others, such as France, Russia, the UK and the US,<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /> invest in higher-cost Expeditionary warfare, which allow their armed forces to project power and sustain military operations abroad.
=== Infrastructure security ===
Infrastructure security is the security provided to protect infrastructure, especially critical infrastructure, such as airports, highways,<ref> urltoken rail transport, hospitals, bridges, transport hubs, network communications, media, the electricity grid, dams, power plants, seaports, Oil refinery, and water systems. Infrastructure security seeks to limit vulnerability of these structures and systems to sabotage, terrorism, and contamination.<ref></ref>
Many countries have established government agencies to directly manage the security of critical infrastructure, usually, through the Ministry of Interior/Home Affairs, dedicated security agencies to protect facilities such as United States Federal Protective Service, and also dedicated transport police such as the British Transport Police. There are also commercial transportation security units such as the Amtrak Police in the United States. Critical infrastructure is vital for the essential functioning of a country. Incidental or deliberate damage can have a serious impact on the economy and essential services. Some of the threats to infrastructure include:
* Terrorism: person or groups deliberately targeting critical infrastructure for political gain. In the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, the Mumbai central station and hospital were deliberately targeted.
* Sabotage: person or groups such as ex-employees, anti-government groups, environmental groups. Refer to Bangkok's International Airport Seized by Protestors.
* Information warfare: private person hacking for private gain or countries initiating attacks to glean information and damage a country's cyberinfrastructure. Cyberattacks on Estonia and cyberattacks during the 2008 South Ossetia war are examples.
* Natural disaster: hurricane or other natural events that damage critical infrastructures such as oil pipelines, water, and power grids. See Hurricane Ike and Economic effects of Hurricane Katrina for examples.
=== Computer security ===
Computer security, also known as cybersecurity or IT security, refers to the security of computing devices such as computers and smartphones, as well as computer networks such as private and public networks, and the Internet. It concerns the protection of hardware, software, data, people, and also the procedures by which systems are accessed, and the field has growing importance due to the increasing reliance on computer systems in most societies.<ref> urltoken "Reliance spells end of road for ICT amateurs", May 07, 2013, The Australian</ref> Since unauthorized access to critical civil and military infrastructure is now considered a major threat, cyberspace is now recognised as a domain of warfare. One such example is the use of Stuxnet by the USA and Israel against the Iranian nuclear programme<ref name=":6" />
=== Political security ===
Barry Buzan, Ole Wæver, Jaap de Wilde and others have argued that national security depends on political security: the stability of the social order.<ref name=":5"></ref> Others, such as Paul Rogers, have added that the equitability of the international order is equally vital.<ref name=":0" /> Hence, political security depends on the rule of international law (including the Law of war), the effectiveness of International institutions, as well as diplomacy and negotiation between nations and other security actors.<ref name=":5" /> It also depends on, among other factors, effective political inclusion of disaffected groups and the human security of the citizenry.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /><ref></ref>
=== Economic security ===
Economic security, in the context of international relations, is the ability of a Nation-state to maintain and develop the national economy, without which other dimensions of national security cannot be managed. Economic capability largely determines the defense capability of a nation, and thus a sound economic security directly influences the national security of a nation. That is why we see countries with sound economy, happen to have sound security setup too, such as The United States, China, India among others. In larger countries, strategies for economic security expect to access resources and markets in other countries and to protect their own markets at home. Developing country may be less secure than economically advanced states due to high rates of unemployment and underpaid work.
=== Ecological security ===
Ecological security, also known as environmental security, refers to the integrity of ecosystems and the biosphere, particularly in relation to their capacity to sustain a Biodiversity (including human life). The security of ecosystems has attracted greater attention as the impact of ecological damage by humans has grown.<ref></ref> The degradation of ecosystems, including Soil erosion, deforestation, biodiversity loss, and climate change, affect economic security and can precipitate mass migration, leading to increased pressure on resources elsewhere. Ecological security is also important since most of the countries in the world are developing and dependent on agriculture and agriculture gets affected largely due to climate change. This effect affects the economy of the nation, which in turn affects national security.
The scope and nature of environmental threats to national security and strategies to engage them are a subject of debate.<ref name="Romm 1993" /> Romm (1993) classifies the major impacts of ecological changes on national security as:<ref name="Romm 1993" />
* Transnational environmental problems. These include global environmental problems such as climate change due to global warming, deforestation, and Biodiversity loss.<ref name="Romm 1993" />
* Local environmental or resource pressures. These include resource scarcities leading to local conflict, such as disputes over water scarcity in the Middle East; migration into the United States caused by the failure of agriculture in Mexico;<ref name="Romm 1993" /> and the impact on the conflict in Syria of erosion of productive land.<ref></ref> Environmental insecurity in Rwanda following a rise in population and dwindling availability of farmland, may also have contributed to the genocide there.<ref></ref>
* Environmentally threatening outcomes of warfare. These include acts of war that degrade or destroy ecosystems. Examples are the Roman destruction of agriculture in Carthage; Saddam Hussein's burning of oil wells in the Gulf War;<ref name="Romm 1993" /> the use of Agent Orange by the UK in the Malayan Emergency and the USA in the Vietnam War for Defoliant forests; and the high greenhouse gas emissions of Military.<ref></ref>
=== Security of energy and natural resources ===
Resources include water, sources of energy, land, and minerals. Availability of adequate natural resources is important for a nation to develop its industry and economic power. For example, in the Persian Gulf War of 1991, Iraq captured Kuwait partly in order to secure access to its oil wells, and one reason for the US counter-invasion was the value of the same wells to its own economy. Water resources are subject to disputes between many nations, including India and Pakistan, and in the Middle East.
The interrelations between security, energy, natural resources, and their sustainability is increasingly acknowledged in national security strategies and resource security is now included among the Sustainable Development Goals.<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":8" /><ref name=":4" /><ref></ref> In the US, for example, the military has installed solar photovoltaic microgrids on their bases in case of power outage.<ref>Prehoda, et al. 2017. urltoken U.S. Strategic Solar Photovoltaic-Powered Microgrid Deployment for Enhanced National Security. Renewable & Sustainable Energy Reviews 78, 167–175. </ref><ref>U.S. Army and Lockheed Martin Commission Microgrid at Fort Bliss. 2013. urltoken 
== Issues in national security ==
=== Consistency of approach ===
The dimensions of national security outlined above are frequently in tension with one another. For example:
* The high cost of maintaining large Military can place a burden on the economic security of a nation And annual defense spending as percent of GDP varies significantly by country.<ref></ref> Conversely, economic constraints can limit the scale of expenditure on Military.
* Unilateral security action by states can undermine political security at an international level if it erodes the rule of law and undermines the authority of International organization. The invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the annexation of Crimea in 2014 have been cited as examples.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
* The pursuit of economic security in competition with other nation states can undermine the ecological security of all when the impact includes widespread Soil erosion, biodiversity loss, and climate change.<ref></ref> Conversely, expenditure on mitigating or adapting to ecological change places a burden on the national economy.
If tensions such as these are not managed effectively, national security policies and actions may be ineffective or counterproductive.
=== National versus transnational security ===
Increasingly, national security strategies have begun to recognise that nations cannot provide for their own security without also developing the security of their regional and international context.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":8"></ref><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":7" /> For example, Sweden's national security strategy of 2017 declared:<blockquote>"Wider security measures must also now encompass protection against epidemics and infectious diseases, combating terrorism and organised crime, ensuring safe transport and reliable food supplies, protecting against energy supply interruptions, countering devastating climate change, initiatives for peace and global development, and much more."<ref name=":7" /></blockquote>
The extent to which this matters, and how it should be done, is the subject of debate. Some argue that the principal beneficiary of national security policy should be the nation state itself, which should centre its strategy on protective and coercive capabilities in order to safeguard itself in a hostile environment (and potentially to project that power into its environment, and dominate it to the point of strategic supremacy).<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> Others argue that security depends principally on building the conditions in which equitable relationships between nations can develop, partly by reducing antagonism between actors, ensuring that fundamental needs can be met, and also that differences of interest can be negotiated effectively.<ref></ref><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0"/> In the UK, for example, Malcolm Chalmers argued in 2015 that the heart of the UK's approach should be support for the Western strategic military alliance led through NATO by the United States, as "the key anchor around which international order is maintained".<ref></ref> The Ammerdown Group argued in 2016 that the UK should shift its primary focus to building international cooperation to tackle the systemic drivers of insecurity, including climate change, economic inequality, Militarization and the political exclusion of the world's poorest people.<ref name=":2" />
=== Impact on civil liberties and human rights ===
Approaches to national security can have a complex impact on human rights and civil liberties. For example, the rights and liberties of citizens are affected by the use of military personnel and Militarization of police to control public behaviour; the use of surveillance, including mass surveillance in cyberspace, which has implications for privacy; military recruitment and conscription practices; and the effects of warfare on civilians and civil infrastructure. This has led to a dialectical struggle, particularly in liberal democracy, between government authority and the rights and freedoms of the general public.
Even where the exercise of national security is subject to good governance, and the rule of law, a risk remains that the term national security may become a pretext for suppressing political dissent. In the US, for example, the controversial USA Patriot Act of 2001, and the revelation by Edward Snowden in 2013 that the National Security Agency Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present), brought these issues to wide public attention. Among the questions raised are whether and how national security considerations at times of war should lead to the suppression of individual rights and freedoms, and whether such restrictions are necessary when a state is not at war.
== Perspectives ==
=== Africa ===
Conceptualizing and understanding the National Security choices and challenges of African States is a difficult task. This is due to the fact that it is often not rooted in the understanding of their (mostly disrupted) state formation and their often imported process of state-building.
Although Post-Cold War conceptualisations of Security have broadened, the policies and practices of many African states still privilege national security as being synonymous with state security and, even more narrowly- regime security.
The problem with the above is that a number of African states (be specific) have been unable to govern their security in meaningful ways. Often failing to be able to claim the monopoly of force in their territories. The hybridity of security ‘governance’ or ‘providers’ thus exists.<ref name="Luckham, R. 2012">Luckham, R., & Kirk, T. (2012). urltoken Security in hybrid political contexts: An end-user approach.</ref> States that have not been able to capture this reality in official National Security strategies and policies often find their claim over having the monopoly of force and thus being the Sovereign challenged.<ref name="Luckham, R. 2012" /> This often leads to the weakening of the state. Examples of such states are South Sudan and Somalia.
=== Argentina and Brazil ===
National Security ideology as taught by the US Army School of the Americas to military personnel was vital in causing the military coup of 1964 in Brazil and the 1976 one in Argentina. The military dictatorships were installed on the claim by the military that Leftists were an existential threat to the national interests.<ref>Emir Sader, "The coup in Brazil and the doctrine of National Security" (Portuguese) urltoken 
=== China ===
China's Armed Forces are known as the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The military is the largest in the world, with 2.3&nbsp;million active troops in 2005.
The Ministry of State Security was established in 1983 to ensure "the security of the state through effective measures against enemy agents, spies, and counterrevolutionary activities designed to sabotage or overthrow China's socialist system."<ref> urltoken Ministry of State Security, Intelligence Resource Program, Federation of American Scientists</ref>
The Chinese concept of national security is an all-encompassing concept. There are concerns that national security law is used to suppress civil liberties and ethnic minorities.
=== India ===
The state of the Republic of India's national security is determined by its internal stability and geopolitical interests. While Islamic upsurge in Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir demanding secession and far left-wing terrorism in India's red corridor remain some key issues in India's internal security, Pakistan and state-sponsored terrorism has been emerging as a major concern for New Delhi.
National Security Advisor (India) heads National Security Council (India), receives all kinds of intelligence reports and is chief advisor to the Prime Minister of India over national and international security policy. National Security Council has India's defence, foreign, home, finance ministers and deputy chairman of NITI Aayog as its members and is responsible for shaping strategies for India's security in all aspects.<ref></ref>
Illegal immigration to India, most of whom are Muslims from Bangladesh and Myanmar (Rohingya muslims) are a national security risk. There is an organised influx of nearly 40,000 illegal Bangladeshi and Rohingya Muslim immigrants in Delhi who pose a national security risk, threaten the national integration, and alter the demographics. A lawyer Ashwini Upadhyay filed a Public interest litigation (PIL) in the "Supreme Court of India" (SC) to identify and deport these. Responding to this PIL, Delhi Police told the SC in July 2019 that nearly 500 illegal Bangladeshi immigrants have been deported in the preceding 28 months.<ref name=illegalbang3> urltoken Nearly 500 illegal Bangladesh nationals detained, deported: Delhi police to SC, Times of India, 31 July 2019.</ref> There are estimated 600,000 to 700,000 illegal Bangladeshi and Rohingya immigrants in National Capital Region (NCR) region specially in the districts of Gurugram, Faridabad, and Nuh (Mewat region), as well as interior villages of Bhiwani and Hisar. Most of them are Muslims who have acquired fake Hindu identity, and under questioning, they pretend to be from West Bengal. In September 2019, the Chief Minister of Haryana, Manohar Lal Khattar announced the implementation of NRC for Haryana by setting up a legal framework under the former judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, Justice HS Bhalla for updating NRC which will help in weeding out these illegal immigrants.<ref name=illegalbang2> urltoken Rohingyas, Bangladeshi refugees likely target of Khattar govt’s updated NRC, Hindustan Times, 16 September 2019.</ref>
=== Russia ===
In the years 1997 and 2000, Russia adopted documents titled "National Security Concept" that described Russia's global position, the country's interests, listed threats to national security, and described the means to counter those threats. In 2009, these documents were superseded by the "National Security Strategy to 2020". The key body responsible for coordinating policies related to Russia's national security is the Security Council of Russia.
According to provision 6 of the National Security Strategy to 2020, national security is "the situation in which the individual, the society and the state enjoy protection from foreign and domestic threats to the degree that ensures constitutional rights and freedoms, decent quality of life for citizens, as well as sovereignty, territorial integrity and stable development of the Russian Federation, the defense and security of the state."
=== Ukraine ===
National security of Ukraine is defined in Ukrainian law as "a set of legislative and organisational measures aimed at permanent protection of vital interests of man and citizen, society and the state, which ensure sustainable development of society, timely detection, prevention and neutralisation of real and potential threats to national interests in areas of law enforcement, fight against corruption, border activities and defense, migration policy, health care, education and science, technology and innovation policy, cultural development of the population, freedom of speech and information security, social policy and pension provision, housing and communal services, financial services market, protection of property rights, stock markets and circulation of securities, fiscal and customs policy, trade and business, banking services, investment policy, auditing, monetary and exchange rate policy, information security, licensing, industry and agriculture, transport and communications, information technology, energy and energy saving, functioning of natural monopolies, use of subsoil, land and water resources, minerals, protection of ecology and environment and other areas of public administration, in the event of emergence of negative trends towards the creation of potential or real threats to national interests.".<ref> urltoken Закон України «Про основи національної безпеки України» від 19.06.2003 №&nbsp;964-IV</ref>
The primary body responsible for coordinating national security policy in Ukraine is the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine. 
It is an advisory state agency to the President of Ukraine, tasked with developing a policy of national security on domestic and international matters. All sessions of the council take place in the Presidential Administration Building. The council was created by the provision of Supreme Council of Ukraine #1658-12 on October 11, 1991. It was defined as the highest state body of collegiate governing on matters of defense and security of Ukraine with the following goals:
* Protecting sovereignty
* Constitutional order
* Territorial integrity and inviolability of the republic
* Developing strategies and continuous improvement of policy in the sphere of defense and state security
* Comprehensive scientific assessment of the military threat nature
* Determining position toward modern warfare
* Effective control over the execution of the tasks of the state and its institutions keeping defense capabilities of Ukraine at the level of defense sufficiency
=== United Kingdom ===
The primary body responsible for coordinating national security policy in the UK is the National Security Council (United Kingdom) which helps produce and enact the UK's National Security Strategy. It was created in May 2010 by the new coalition government of the Conservative Party (UK) and Liberal Democrats. The National Security Council is a committee of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom and was created as part of a wider reform of the national security apparatus. This reform also included the creation of a National Security Adviser and a National Security Secretariat to support the National Security Council.<ref></ref>
=== United States ===
==== National Security Act of 1947 ====
The concept of national security became an official guiding principle of foreign policy in the United States when the National Security Act of 1947 was signed on July 26, 1947, by U.S. President Harry S. Truman.<ref name="Romm 1993" /> As amended in 1949, this Act:
:* created important components of American national security, such as the precursor to the Department of Defense;
:* subordinated the military branches to the new cabinet-level position of Secretary of Defense;
:* established the National Security Council and the Central Intelligence Agency;<ref name="Davis"></ref>
Notably, the Act did not define national security, which was conceivably advantageous, as its ambiguity made it a powerful phrase to invoke against diverse threats to interests of the state, such as domestic concerns.<ref name="Romm 1993" />
The notion that national security encompasses more than just military security was present, though understated, from the beginning. The Act established the National Security Council so as to "advise the President on the integration of domestic, military and foreign policies relating to national security".<ref name="Paleri" />
While not defining the "interests" of national security, the Act does establish, within the National Security Council, the "Committee on Foreign Intelligence", whose duty is to conduct an annual review "identifying the intelligence required to address the national security interests of the United States as specified by the President" (emphasis added).<ref></ref>
In Gen. Maxwell Taylor's 1974 essay "The Legitimate Claims of National Security", Taylor states:<ref></ref>
==== National security state ====
To reflect on the institutionalisation of new bureaucratic infrastructures and governmental practices in the post-World War II period in the U.S., when a culture of semi-permanent military mobilisation brought around the National Security Council, the CIA, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, national-security researchers apply a notion of a national security state:<ref>Yergin, Daniel.

==== Obama administration ====
The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff defines national security of the United States in the following manner :<ref></ref>
In 2010, the White House included an all-encompassing world-view in a national security strategy which identified "security" as one of the country's "four enduring national interests" that were "inexorably intertwined":<ref>. urltoken National Security Strategy, May 2010 . Office of the President of the United States, White House, p. 17. Accessed 23 September 2010.</ref>
==== Empowerment of women ====
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said that, "The countries that threaten regional and global peace are the very places where women and girls are deprived of dignity and opportunity".<ref name="Lemmon 2013"></ref> She has noted that countries, where women are oppressed, are places where the "rule of law and democracy are struggling to take root",<ref name="Lemmon 2013" /> and that, when women's rights as equals in society are upheld, the society as a whole changes and improves, which in turn enhances stability in that society, which in turn contributes to global society.<ref name="Lemmon 2013" />
==== Cyber ====
The Bush Administration in January 2008, initiated the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI). It introduced a differentiated approach, such as: identifying existing and emerging cybersecurity threats, finding and plugging existing cyber vulnerabilities, and apprehending actors that trying to gain access to secure federal information systems.<ref>Rollins, John, and Anna C. Henning. Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative Legal Authorities and Policy Considerations. Washington, D.C.: Congressional Research Service, 2009.</ref> President Obama issued a declaration that the "cyber threat is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation" and that "America's economic prosperity in the 21st century will depend on cybersecurity."<ref></ref>

National security or national defence is the security and defence of a nation state, including its citizens, economy, and institutions, which is regarded as a duty of government.
Originally conceived as protection against military attack, national security is now widely understood to include also non-military dimensions, including the security from terrorism, minimisation of crime, economic security, energy security, environmental security, food security, cyber-security etc. Similarly, national security risks include, in addition to the actions of other nation states, action by violent non-state actors, by narcotic cartels, and by multinational corporations, and also the effects of natural disasters.
Governments rely on a range of measures, including political, economic, and military power, as well as diplomacy, to safeguard the security of a nation-state. They may also act to build the conditions of security regionally and internationally by reducing transnational causes of insecurity, such as global warming, economic inequality, Social exclusion, and nuclear proliferation.
The national security has core values which are commitment to service, respect for the law, integrity, transparency, respect for people, and accountability. They know they serve their country and they want to do what is best.
