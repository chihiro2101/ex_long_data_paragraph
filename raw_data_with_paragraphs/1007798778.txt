Reclaim the Streets

==History==
Reclaim The Streets was originally formed by Earth First!<ref>Wall, Derek. Earth First and the Anti-Roads Movement. London: Routledge. 1999. </ref> in London, England in Autumn 1991<ref></ref> and was born out of anti-road protest camps at places such as Claremont Road and Twyford Down. The idea of street reclaiming soon spread throughout the United Kingdom. The first actions can be seen as specifically anti-car and pro-alternative transport, but over the years the members of the core group changed its focus, realising that it was better to go to the root of the problem as they saw it, namely the capitalist system.<ref>A direct action network for global and local social-ecological revolution(s) to transcend hierarchical and authoritarian society, (capitalism included), and still be home in time for tea. Welcome to the cyber-streets of RTSLondon. urltoken Reclaim The Streets! website </ref> "Our streets are as full of capitalism as of cars and the pollution of capitalism is much more insidious."<ref>Reclaim The Streets Agit-Prop (Distributed at the M41 Street Party on Saturday 13 July 1996) quoted on urltoken Do or Die Issue 6, Summer 1997. In the paper edition, this article appears on page(s) 1–10.
</ref> Nevertheless, the actions always followed the principle of non-violent direct action.
The idea of a Reclaim The Streets action was quickly taken up as a form of protest around the world. These "street party" have been held in cities all over Europe, Australia, North America, and Africa. Initial instances confounded authorities and drivers alike, but over the years the protests have become institutionalised in many places, occurring much like other forms of legal protest in that the event is arranged with authorities beforehand, but not in all places like for example in Finland, where the first Street party outside the UK was arranged on 17 May 1997.

Reclaim the Streets also known as RTS, are a collective with a shared ideal of community ownership of public spaces. Participants characterise the collective as a resistance movement opposed to the dominance of corporate forces in globalisation, and to the car as the dominant mode of transport.
Reclaim the Streets often stage non-violent direct action street reclaiming events such as the 'invasion' of a major road, highway or freeway to stage a party. While this may obstruct the regular users of these spaces such as car drivers and public bus riders, the philosophy of RTS is that it is vehicle traffic, not pedestrians, who are causing the obstruction, and that by occupying the road they are in fact opening up public space. The events are usually spectacular and colourful, with sand pits for children to play in, free food and music, however they have been known to degenerate into riots and violence.<ref>Naomi Klein.

The style of the parties in many places has been influenced by the rave scene in the UK, with sound systems playing dance music.
