==The Ecology of Language Paradigm==
Tsuda is well known as a critic of the hegemony of English and as an advocate of linguistic and cultural pluralism. He believes that the domination of English is tantamount to linguicism and linguicide, and that addressing the problem of linguistic hegemony is crucial to the development of human and cultural security.<ref>Yukio Tsuda, "Anglomania Muddies Japan's Self-Image," Asahi Evening News, January 23, 1997, p. 8.</ref><ref>Yukio Tsuda, "Language Problems in Intercultural Communication: Review and Suggestions," Studies in Language and Culture, Vol. 10, No. 1, 1988, pp. 17-30.</ref><ref>Yukio Tsuda, "Speaking Against the Hegemony of English," in Special Research Project: Civil Society, the State and Culture in Comparative Perspective (Annual Report), Tsukuba, Japan: University of Tsukuba, 2005, pp. 235-244.</ref> In an article in The San Matean, a San Mateo Community College newspaper, dated March 19, 2007, Tsuda was quoted to say: "It is more important to be students learning other languages than being a teacher only teaching one." He proposed the "ecology of language" paradigm as opposed to the "diffusion of English" paradigm.
Tsuda urges international and intercultural communication scholars to recognize the hegemony of English as a subject of academic inquiry in the fields especially in the English-speaking countries. He also suggests that English-language teaching professionals incorporate the ecology of language paradigm into the contents and methods of teaching as well as teacher education. Finally, he insists that both native speakers and non-native speakers of English learn the philosophy of the ecology of language so that they will become more sensitive to the ethical aspects of international and intercultural communication.<ref>Yukio Tsuda, "The Hegemony of English and Strategies for Linguistic Pluralism: Proposing the Ecology of Language Paradigm," in Molefi Kete Asante, Yoshitaka Miike, and Jing Yin (Eds.), The Global Intercultural Communication Reader (2nd Ed.), New York, NY: Routledge, 2014, p. 455.</ref>
