Spalding Gray

===Posthumous works by and about him===
In 2005, Gray's unfinished final monologue was published in a hardcover edition entitled Life Interrupted: The Unfinished Monologue. The monologue, which Gray had performed in one of his last public appearances, is augmented by two additional pieces he performed at the time, a short remembrance called "The Anniversary" and an open letter to New York City written in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Also included in the book is an extensive collection of remembrances and tributes from fellow performers and friends.
The 2007 play Spalding Gray: Stories Left to Tell, produced at the Minetta Lane Theatre in New York City, is based on his monologues and journals. Kathleen Russo, his widow, developed the concept for the play.<ref name="brantley"/> The show has a cast of four actors as well as a rotating guest artist; all five read from selected portions of his work.<ref name="brantley"></ref>
In January 2010, Steven Soderbergh's documentary about Gray, And Everything Is Going Fine, was released at Utah's Slamdance Film Festival. The film was compiled from film and video clips of Gray's early life and career. His widow said that Soderbergh "wanted Spalding to tell the story, as if it was his last monologue, and I think he accomplished that".<ref></ref>
In 2011 a selection from his journals was published as The Journals of Spalding Gray, edited by Nell Casey, who had worked with his widow Kathie Russo on the project.<ref name="rosenbaum"></ref> Dwight Garner thought this material was less interesting than Spalding's monologues. He said they have value as a "portrait of a theatrical coming of age" as Gray determined how to make his art. Garner notes, "His art, these journals make clear, is what kept him alive."<ref name="garner"></ref>
The 2016 season of the Independent Film Channel's mockumentary television series Documentary Now! includes the episode "Parker Gail's Location is Everything," a parody of Gray's Swimming to Cambodia.<ref></ref> In it, Bill Hader delivers a monologue expressing his dismay at having to find a new loft apartment in New York City upon learning that his current residence will be converted into an electronics store.

Director Jonathan Demme said of Gray, "Spalding's unfailing ability to ignite universal emotions and laughter in all of us while gloriously wallowing in his own exquisite uniqueness will remain forever one of the great joys of American performance and literature".<ref name=Swimming/>
"He took the anarchy and illogic of life and molded it into something we could grab a hold of," said actor and novelist Eric Bogosian. "It took courage to do what Spalding did, courage to make theatre so naked and unadorned, to expose himself in this way and to fight his demons in public."
Theater critic Mel Gussow wrote of Gray's Swimming to Cambodia and Terrors of Pleasure that "Through a look or a comment, he offers intelligent analysis. Though the narrative is entirely centered around Mr. Gray himself, it never suffers from self-pity or self-indulgence. He remains the antihero in his own fascinating life story, the never ending tale of EverySpalding."<ref></ref>
