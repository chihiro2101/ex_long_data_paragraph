Prostate massage

==Medical uses==
===Digital rectal examination===
Prostate massage is part of the digital rectal examination (DRE) routinely given to men by urologists in order to look for nodules of prostate cancer and to obtain an expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) specimen for microscopy and microbiological culture to screen for prostatitis.
====Therapy for prostatitis====
In the late 1990s, a small number of doctors tried prostate massage in conjunction with antibiotics for the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis with uncertain results.<ref name="pmid10527258"></ref><ref name="pmid12496826"></ref> In recent trials, however, prostate massage was not shown to improve outcomes compared to antibiotics alone.<ref name="pmid16566972"></ref> As a consequence of these findings, prostate massage is not officially sanctioned in western medicine for the treatment of any medical disorder today. Prostatic massage should never be performed on patients with acute prostatitis, because the infection can spread elsewhere in the body if massage is performed.<ref name="pmid10584615"></ref>
====History====
Once the most popular therapeutic maneuver used to treat prostatitis, it was abandoned as primary therapy in the 1960s.<ref name="pmid10374787"></ref>
In the late 1990s the ineffectiveness of drug treatments for chronic prostatitis led to a brief resurgence of interest in prostate massage.<ref name="pmid10527258"/><ref name="pmid12496826"/> In a recent trial, however, prostate massage was not shown to improve outcomes compared to antibiotics alone.<ref name="pmid16566972"/>
The practice is still used in some parts of China.<ref name="pmid18597833"></ref>
===Risks===
Vigorous prostate massage has been documented to have injurious consequences: periprostatic hemorrhage,<ref name="pmid14655640"></ref> cellulitis, septicaemia, possible disturbance and metastasis of prostate cancer to other parts of the body, and hemorrhoidal flare-up, and rectal fissures.<ref></ref><ref name="nihtest"></ref>
===Electroejaculation===
Electroejaculation is a procedure in which nerves are stimulated via an electric probe, which is inserted into the rectum adjacent to the prostate. The stimulus voltage stimulates nearby nerves, resulting in contraction of the pelvic muscles and ejaculation. It is most commonly encountered in animal husbandry for the purpose of semen collection for testing or breeding. Some devices are used under general anesthesia on humans who have certain types of anejaculation.<ref name="human-electroej"></ref> Electroejaculation is a different procedure from manual prostate massage.
==As a sexual practice==
===General===
Prostate massage is also used as an erotic massage for sexual stimulation, often in order to reach orgasm. It is possible for some men to achieve orgasms through prostate stimulation alone.<ref name="Rosenthal"/><ref name="Wibowo"></ref> Stimulation may be achieved by use of one or more fingers or by using sex toys designed to bring pressure to the anterior wall of the rectum at the location of the gland. The prostate is sometimes referred to as the "male G-spot" or P-spot.<ref></ref> Some men can achieve orgasm through stimulation of the prostate gland, such as prostate massage or receptive anal intercourse, and men who report the sensation of prostate stimulation often give descriptions similar to females' accounts of G-spot stimulation.<ref name="Rosenthal"></ref><ref name=Ladas></ref> Prostate stimulation can produce a stronger, more powerful, and "deeper" orgasm than solely penile stimulation, described by some men as more widespread, intense, and enduring, and allowing for greater feelings of ecstasy than orgasm elicited by penile stimulation only.<ref name="Rosenthal"/> However, though the experiences are different, male orgasms by penile stimulation are also centered in the prostate gland.<ref name="Lewin, Leap"></ref>
Prostate massage may be practiced between sexual partners, either as a discrete activity or during other sexual acts stimulating the penis for example. The increasing availability (online via the Internet) of purpose-designed, safe and hygienic sex toys and devices aimed at prostate stimulation may encourage sexual experimentation and incorporation into sex play. The use of a finger for anal penetration and prostate stimulation can enhance a man's orgasm or vary the sensations experienced during sexual arousal. The finger of the prostate massager is introduced into the rectum through the anus and the prostate gland is gently massaged via the anterior (front) wall of the rectum. In some individuals or for some massagers the correct location of the prostate may be slightly too deep or the finger too short to reach easily. Prostate massage can be performed individually or with the help of a partner.
Prostate massage may also be used in long-term orgasm denial play, for the purpose of relieving immediate need for orgasm without impacting general feelings of arousal. For this purpose it is often referred to as milking. 
There are safety matters relating to prostate stimulation and anal penetration. It is strongly recommended that plenty of lubricant be used with prostate massagers to prevent rectal lining damage. A smaller instrument or finger may be introduced gradually to minimize the discomfort that some may feel. Massagers may be used with or without a condom; however, because of the bacteria found in the rectum, if a condom is not used, it is very important to clean the tool with soap before use in another orifice or by a partner. Receiving anal stimulation may cause feelings of having to defecate. More often than not, this is just a sensation that the stimulation causes and may take some getting used to.<ref name="Ask Alice"></ref>
===Equipment===
A prostate massager is a device for massaging the prostate gland. The shape of a prostate massager is similar to a finger, since prostate massages are traditionally given digitally (for example, via fingering). They usually have a slightly curved head to effectively massage the prostate. Lubricant is usually necessary before inserting anything into the anus and helps to avoid traumatising the rectal mucosa (lining). Caution should be exercised when a prostate massager is used because of the sensitivity of the prostate. Correct use involves a medium to light repetitive massage, or circular motionâ€”the device being used to administer the massage should not be used too vigorously or without care, since this may lead to injury.
Prostate massage equipment ranges from dildos to butt plugs and G-Spot vibrators. When used in sexual practice, prostate massagers are commonly referred to as "prostate toys", "prostate sex toys", and "anal toys". These prostate massagers are inserted into the rectum through the anus and are intended to stimulate the prostate by simple massaging or vibrating. They are used during foreplay by many couples.
Prostate dildos are similar to vaginal dildos, but they tend to be more curved, slimmer and with a softer texture. Some of the new prostate dildos on the market are driven by batteries and offer vibration at the tip; the speed or intensity of which may be changed depending on the subject's personal preference. Unlike vaginal dildos, the anal prostate massager has a flared end to prevent it from being fully inserted and 'lost' inside the rectum.
Some men prefer butt plugs, which are easy to use, can be inserted freely and left in place while the man's hands are free for other sexual activities such as masturbation. Anal plugs also come in various shapes, sizes and designs and are not commonly intended to stimulate the prostate. Newer, more angled models (second generation) of prostate massagers have been developed to provide a more direct and thorough massage of the prostate gland.<ref name="Helix"></ref> These new devices feature a more curved shape and are slightly longer than the originals. They commonly have a narrow neck and a flared end to avoid losing them in the rectum. While many massagers rely upon the body's own natural muscular contractions of the anal sphincter and anal wall to stimulate the prostate, some of the newer models come with vibrators built into them to increase sexual pleasure.
A G-spot vibrator can be used as a prostate massager as long as it is handled carefully and is provided with a safety base that will not allow it to be lost in the rectum. Vibrators for prostate stimulation usually have a pronounced curve at the end.

Prostate massage is the massage or stimulation of the male prostate gland for medical purposes or sexual stimulation.
The prostate takes part in the sexual response cycle, and is essential for the production of semen. Due to its proximity to the anterior rectal wall, it can be stimulated from the anterior wall of the rectum or externally via the perineum.
