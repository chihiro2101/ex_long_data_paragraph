Patrick Moore

==Other interests and popular culture==
Because of his long-running television career and eccentric demeanour, Moore was widely recognised and became a popular public figure. In 1976 it was used to good effect for an April Fools' Day spoof on BBC Radio 2, when Moore announced a once-in-a-lifetime astronomical event that meant that if listeners could jump at that exact moment, 9.47 a.m. they would experience a temporary sensation of weightlessness.<ref name="page 252"></ref> The BBC received many telephone calls from listeners alleging they experienced the sensation.<ref name="page 252"/> He was a key figure in the establishment of the International Birdman event in Bognor Regis, which was initially held in Selsey.<ref></ref>
Moore appeared in other television and radio shows, including Just a Minute and, from 1992 until 1998, playing the role of GamesMaster in the television show of the same name: a character who professed to know everything there is to know about video gaming.<ref></ref> He would issue video game challenges and answered questions on cheats and tips. The show's host, Dominik Diamond, claimed that Moore did not understand anything that he said on the show, yet managed to record his contributions in single takes.<ref></ref>
Moore was a keen amateur actor, appearing in local plays.<ref></ref> He appeared in self-parodying roles, in several episodes of The Goodies and on the Morecambe and Wise show, and broadcast with Kenneth Horne only a few days before Horne's death.<ref></ref> He had a minor role in the fourth radio series of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and a lead role in the BBC Radio 1 sci-fi play, Independence Day UK in which amongst other things, Moore fills in as a navigator.<ref></ref> Among other shows, he appeared in It's a Knockout, Blankety Blank and Face the Music, and in the Q.E.D. episode "Round Britain Whizz".<ref></ref>
He expressed appreciation for the science fiction television series Doctor Who and Star Trek, but stated that he had stopped watching when "they went PC - making women commanders, that kind of thing".<ref></ref> Despite this he subsequently made a cameo appearance in the Doctor Who episode "The Eleventh Hour" in 2010, which was Matt Smith's debut as the Eleventh Doctor.<ref></ref> In the 1960s, Moore had been approached by the Doctor Who story editor Gerry Davis to act as a scientific advisor on the series to help with the accuracy of stories, a position ultimately taken by Kit Pedler.<ref name="Burk/Smith"></ref>
A keen amateur chess player, Moore carried a pocket set and was vice president of Sussex Junior Chess Association.<ref></ref> In 2003, he presented Sussex Junior David Howell with the best young chess player award on Carlton Television's Britain's Brilliant Prodigies show. Moore had represented Sussex in his youth.<ref name="page 41"/>
Moore was an enthusiastic amateur cricketer, playing for the Selsey Cricket Club well into his seventies.<ref></ref> He played for the Lord's Taverners, a cricketing charity team, as a bowler with an unorthodox action. Though an accomplished leg spin bowler, he was a number 11 batsman and a poor fielder.<ref></ref> The jacket notes to his book "Suns, Myths and Men" (1968) said his hobbies included "chess, which he plays with a peculiar leg-spin, and cricket." He played golf, and won a Pro-Am competition in Southampton in 1975.<ref></ref>
Until forced to give up because of arthritis, Moore was a keen pianist and accomplished xylophone player, having first played the instrument at the age of 13.<ref></ref> He composed a substantial corpus of works, including two operettas.<ref></ref> Moore had a ballet, Lyra's Dream, written to his music. He performed at a Royal Command Performance, and performed a duet with Evelyn Glennie.<ref></ref>
In 1998, as a guest on Have I Got News for You, he accompanied the show's closing theme tune on the xylophone and as a pianist, he once accompanied Albert Einstein playing Le cygne by Camille Saint-Saëns on the violin (no recording was made).<ref></ref> In 1981 he performed a solo xylophone rendition of the Sex Pistols' "Anarchy in the U.K." in a Royal Variety Performance.<ref>The Daily Telegraph – 21 August 1981, pg 21, "Xy-Moore-phone"</ref> He did not enjoy most popular music: when played ten modern rock songs by such artists as Hawkwind, Muse and Pink Floyd, in a 2009 interview with journalist Joel McIver, he explained, "To my ear, all these songs are universally awful."<ref></ref>
Before encountering health problems he was an extensive traveller, and had visited all seven continents, including Antarctica; he said his favourite two countries were Iceland and Norway.<ref></ref> On 7 March 2006 he was hospitalised and fitted with a pacemaker because of a cardiac abnormality.<ref></ref>
He was a friend of Queen guitarist and astrophysicist Brian May, who was an occasional guest on The Sky at Night.<ref></ref> May bought Moore's Selsey home in 2008, leasing it back to him for a peppercorn rent the same day to provide financial security.<ref></ref> May, Moore and Chris Lintott co-wrote a book Bang! The Complete History of the Universe. In February 2011, Moore completed (with Robin Rees and Iain Nicolson) his comprehensive Patrick Moore's Data Book of Astronomy for Cambridge University Press. In 1986 he was identified as the co-author of a book published in 1954 called Flying Saucer from Mars, attributed to Cedric Allingham, which was intended as a money-making venture and practical joke on UFO believers;<ref name=allen>Allan, C. and Campbell, S. Flying Saucer from Moore's?, Magonia v. 23 (July 1986): pp 15–18</ref> Moore never admitted his involvement. He once joined the Flat Earth Society as an ironic joke.<ref></ref>
Moore believed himself to be the only person to have met the first aviator, Orville Wright, the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin, and the first man on the moon, Neil Armstrong.<ref name=telegraphobit></ref>
In March 2015, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 45-minute play based on the life of Moore, The Far Side of the Moore by Sean Grundy, starring Tom Hollander as Moore and Patricia Hodge as his mother.<ref></ref>
Moore is portrayed by Daniel Beales in the Netflix series The Crown.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
==Honours and appointments==
In 1945, Moore was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (FRAS), and in 1977 he was awarded the society's Jackson-Gwilt Medal. In 1968, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) and promoted to a Commander (CBE) in 1988. In 1999 he became the Honorary President of the East Sussex Astronomical Society, a position he held until his death. Moore was knighted for "services to the popularisation of science and to broadcasting" in the 2001 New Year Honours.<ref></ref>
In 2001, he was appointed an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society (HonFRS), the only amateur astronomer ever to achieve the distinction.<ref></ref> In June 2002, he was appointed as the Honorary Vice-President of the Society for the History of Astronomy. Also in 2002, Buzz Aldrin presented him with a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award for services to television.<ref></ref> He was patron of Torquay Boys' Grammar School in south Devon. Moore had a long association with the University of Leicester and its Department of Physics and Astronomy, and was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Science (HonDSc) degree in 1996 and a Distinguished Honorary Fellowship in 2008, the highest award that the university can bestow.<ref name=bull1></ref>
==Personal life and death==
World War II had a significant influence on Moore's life – he said his only romance ended when his fiancée Lorna, a nurse, was killed in London in 1943 by a bomb which struck her ambulance. Moore subsequently remarked that he never married because "there was no one else for me&nbsp;. second best is no good for me&nbsp;. I would have liked a wife and family, but it was not to be."<ref></ref> Some doubt has arisen over Moore's account, as researchers have been unable to identify Lorna, despite the meticulous records kept of wartime civilian casualties.<ref></ref> In his autobiography, he said that after sixty years he still thought about her, and because of her death "if I saw the entire German nation sinking into the sea, I could be relied upon to help push it down."<ref name="page 5"></ref> In May 2012, he said to the Radio Times magazine, "We must take care. There may be another war. The Germans will try again, given another chance." He also said, in the same interview, that "The only good Kraut is a dead Kraut."<ref></ref>
Moore said he was "exceptionally close" to his mother Gertrude,<ref name="page 4"/> a talented artist who shared his home at Selsey, West Sussex, which was decorated with her paintings of "bogeys" – little friendly aliens – that she produced and sent out annually as the Moores' Christmas cards.<ref></ref> Moore wrote the foreword for his mother's 1974 book, Mrs Moore in Space.<ref></ref>
On 9 December 2012, Moore died aged 89 at his home in Selsey.<ref></ref> On 9 December 2014 it was reported that the Science Museum, London had acquired a large collection of his objects and manuscripts and memorabilia, including The Sky at Night scripts, and about 70 of his observation books, over more than 60 years, and manuscripts for astronomy and fiction books, and a 12.5-inch reflecting telescope.<ref></ref>
