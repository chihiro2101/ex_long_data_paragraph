Mark Twain

===Labor===
Twain wrote glowingly about unions in the river boating industry in Life on the Mississippi, which was read in union halls decades later.<ref>Philip S. Foner, Mark Twain: Social Critic (New York: International Publishers, 1958), p. 98</ref> He supported the labor movement, especially one of the most important unions, the Knights of Labor.<ref name="helen-scott"/> In a speech to them, he said:
===Religion===
Twain was a Presbyterian.<ref></ref> He was critical of organized religion and certain elements of Christianity through his later life. He wrote, for example, "Faith is believing what you know ain't so", and "If Christ were here now there is one thing he would not be&nbsp;– a Christian".<ref name="Huberman"></ref> With anti-Catholic sentiment rampant in 19th century America, Twain noted he was "educated to enmity toward everything that is Catholic".<ref></ref> As an adult, he engaged in religious discussions and attended services, his theology developing as he wrestled with the deaths of loved ones and with his own mortality.<ref name="199.236.117.33">Dempsey, Terrell, urltoken Book Review: Mark Twain's Religion. William E. Phipps 2004 Mark Twain Forum</ref>
Twain generally avoided publishing his most controversial<ref></ref> opinions on religion in his lifetime, and they are known from essays and stories that were published later. In the essay Three Statements of the Eighties in the 1880s, Twain stated that he believed in an almighty God, but not in any messages, revelations, holy scriptures such as the Bible, Providence, or retribution in the afterlife. He did state that "the goodness, the justice, and the mercy of God are manifested in His works", but also that "deism", which determine "small matters", such as who dies in a pestilence.<ref>Twain, Mark, ed. by Paul Baender. 1973. What is man?: and other philosophical writings. p. 56</ref> At other times, he wrote or spoke in ways that contradicted a strict deist view, for example, plainly professing a belief in Providence.<ref>Phipps, William E., urltoken Mark Twain's Religion, pp. 263–266, 2003 Mercer Univ. Press</ref> In some later writings in the 1890s, he was less optimistic about the theodicy, observing that "if our Maker is all-powerful for good or evil, He is not in His right mind". At other times, he conjectured sardonically that perhaps God had created the world with all its tortures for some purpose of His own, but was otherwise indifferent to humanity, which was too petty and insignificant to deserve His attention anyway.<ref>Twain, Mark, ed. by Paul Baender. 1973. What is man?: and other philosophical writings. pp.10, 486</ref>
In 1901, Twain criticized the actions of the missionary Dr. William Scott Ament (1851–1909) because Ament and other missionaries had collected indemnities from Chinese subjects in the aftermath of the Boxer Uprising of 1900. Twain's response to hearing of Ament's methods was published in the North American Review in February 1901: To the Person Sitting in Darkness, and deals with examples of imperialism in China, South Africa, and with the U.S. occupation of the Philippines.<ref>Mark Twain, "To the Person Sitting in Darkness", The North American Review 182:531 (February 1901):161–176; </ref> A subsequent article, "To My Missionary Critics" published in The North American Review in April 1901, unapologetically continues his attack, but with the focus shifted from Ament to his missionary superiors, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.<ref>Mark Twain, "To My Missionary Critics", The North American Review 172 (April 1901):520–534; </ref>
After his death, Twain's family suppressed some of his work that was especially irreverent toward conventional religion, including Letters from the Earth, which was not published until his daughter Clara reversed her position in 1962 in response to Soviet propaganda about the withholding.<ref name="NYTimes1962"></ref> The anti-religious The Mysterious Stranger was published in 1916. Little Bessie, a story ridiculing Christianity, was first published in the 1972 collection Mark Twain's Fables of Man.<ref></ref>
He raised money to build a Presbyterian Church in Nevada in 1864.<ref></ref>
Twain created a reverent portrayal of Joan of Arc, a subject over which he had obsessed for forty years, studied for a dozen years and spent two years writing about.<ref name="The Adventures of Mark Twain">Paine, Albert Bigelow, urltoken The Adventures of Mark Twain, p. 281, Kessinger 2004</ref> In 1900 and again in 1908 he stated, "I like Joan of Arc best of all my books, it is the best".<ref name="The Adventures of Mark Twain"/><ref>Goy-Blanquet, Dominique, urltoken Joan of Arc, a saint for all reasons: studies in myth and politics, p. 132, 2003 Ashgate Publishing</ref>
Those who knew Twain well late in life recount that he dwelt on the subject of the afterlife, his daughter Clara saying: "Sometimes he believed death ended everything, but most of the time he felt sure of a life beyond."<ref>Phipps, William E., urltoken Mark Twain's Religion, p. 304, 2003 Mercer Univ. Press</ref>
Twain's frankest views on religion appeared in his final work Autobiography of Mark Twain, the publication of which started in November 2010, 100 years after his death. In it, he said:<ref></ref>
Twain was a Freemason.<ref></ref><ref></ref> He belonged to Polar Star Lodge No. 79 A.F.&A.M., based in St. Louis. He was initiated an Entered Apprentice on May 22, 1861, passed to the degree of Fellow Craft on June 12, and raised to the degree of Master Mason on July 10.
Twain visited Salt Lake City for two days and met there members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They also gave him a Book of Mormon.<ref></ref> He later wrote in Roughing It about that book:<ref>Roughing It – Chapter 16</ref><ref></ref>
===Vivisection===
Twain was opposed to the vivisection practices of his day. His objection was not on a scientific basis but rather an ethical one. He specifically cited the pain caused to the animal as his basis of his opposition:<ref>Mark Twain, urltoken Letter to Sidney G. Trist, Editor of the Animals' Friend Magazine, in his capacity as Secretary of the London Anti-Vivisection Society (May 26, 1899), in Mark Twain's Notebooks, ed. Carlo De Vito (Black Dog & Leventhal, 2015).</ref><ref></ref>
<blockquote>I am not interested to know whether Vivisection produces results that are profitable to the human race or doesn't.&nbsp;. The pains which it inflicts upon unconsenting animals is the basis of my enmity towards it, and it is to me sufficient justification of the enmity without looking further.</blockquote>
==Pen names==
Twain used different pen names before deciding on "Mark Twain". He signed humorous and imaginative sketches as "Josh" until 1863. Additionally, he used the pen name "Thomas Jefferson Snodgrass" for a series of humorous letters.<ref>Thomas Jefferson Snodgrass, (Charles Honce, James Bennet, ed.), Pascal Covici, Chicago, 1928</ref>
He maintained that his primary pen name came from his years working on Mississippi riverboats, where two fathoms, a depth indicating water safe for the passage of boat, was a measure on the sounding line. Twain is an archaic term for "two", as in "The veil of the temple was rent in twain."<ref></ref> The riverboatman's cry was "mark twain" or, more fully, "by the mark twain", meaning "according to the mark on the line, the depth is two fathoms", that is, "The water is deep and it is safe to pass."
Twain said that his famous pen name was not entirely his invention. In Life on the Mississippi, he wrote:
<blockquote>Isaiah Sellers was not of literary turn or capacity, but he used to jot down brief paragraphs of plain practical information about the river, and sign them "MARK TWAIN", and give them to the Times-Picayune. They related to the stage and condition of the river, and were accurate and valuable;&nbsp;. At the time that the telegraph brought the news of his death, I was on the Pacific coast. I was a fresh new journalist, and needed a nom de guerre; so I confiscated the ancient mariner's discarded one, and have done my best to make it remain what it was in his hands&nbsp;– a sign and symbol and warrant that whatever is found in its company may be gambled on as being the petrified truth; how I have succeeded, it would not be modest in me to say.<ref>Life on the Mississippi, chapter 50</ref></blockquote>
Twain's story about his pen name has been questioned by some<ref> Cited in </ref> with the suggestion that "mark twain" refers to a running bar tab that Twain would regularly incur while drinking at John Piper's saloon in Virginia City, Nevada. Samuel Clemens himself responded to this suggestion by saying, "Mark Twain was the nom de plume of one Captain Isaiah Sellers, who used to write river news over it for the New Orleans Picayune. He died in 1863 and as he could no longer need that signature, I laid violent hands upon it without asking permission of the proprietor's remains. That is the history of the nom de plume I bear."<ref>Fatout, Paul. "Mark Twain's Nom de Plume." American Literature, v 34, n 1 (March 1962), pp.&nbsp;1–7. . .</ref>
In his autobiography, Twain writes further of Captain Sellers' use of "Mark Twain": <blockquote>I was a cub pilot on the Mississippi River then, and one day I wrote a rude and crude satire which was leveled at Captain Isaiah Sellers, the oldest steamboat pilot on the Mississippi River, and the most respected, esteemed, and revered. For many years he had occasionally written brief paragraphs concerning the river and the changes which it had undergone under his observation during fifty years, and had signed these paragraphs "Mark Twain" and published them in the St. Louis and New Orleans journals. In my satire I made rude game of his reminiscences. It was a shabby poor performance, but I didn't know it, and the pilots didn't know it. The pilots thought it was brilliant. They were jealous of Sellers, because when the gray-heads among them pleased their vanity by detailing in the hearing of the younger craftsmen marvels which they had seen in the long ago on the river, Sellers was always likely to step in at the psychological moment and snuff them out with wonders of his own which made their small marvels look pale and sick. However, I have told all about this in "Old Times on the Mississippi." The pilots handed my extravagant satire to a river reporter, and it was published in the New Orleans True Delta. That poor old Captain Sellers was deeply wounded. He had never been held up to ridicule before; he was sensitive, and he never got over the hurt which I had wantonly and stupidly inflicted upon his dignity. I was proud of my performance for a while, and considered it quite wonderful, but I have changed my opinion of it long ago. Sellers never published another paragraph nor ever used his nom de guerre again.<ref>" urltoken Autobiography of Mark Twain." Volume 2; 10 September 1906, (2013, 2008), Paragraph 4.</ref> </blockquote>
==Legacy and depictions==
===Trademark white suit===
While Twain is often depicted wearing a white suit, modern representations suggesting that he wore them throughout his life are unfounded. Evidence suggests that Twain began wearing white suits on the lecture circuit, after the death of Olivia Langdon Clemens in 1904. However, there is also evidence showing him wearing a white suit before 1904. In 1882, he sent a photograph of himself in a white suit to 18-year-old Edward W. Bok, later publisher of the Ladies Home Journal, with a handwritten dated note. The white suit did eventually become his trademark, as illustrated in anecdotes about this eccentricity (such as the time he wore a white summer suit to a Congressional hearing during the winter).<ref name="c-a-kirk" /> McMasters' The Mark Twain Encyclopedia states that Twain did not wear a white suit in his last three years, except at one banquet speech.<ref></ref>
In his autobiography, Twain writes of his early experiments with wearing white out-of-season:<ref name=TwainSuit>Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, when the summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and comfortable white clothes and enter for the winter into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold up here in the New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.<br />I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.

As counterpoint, Twain's essay on "The Literary Offenses of Fenimore Cooper" offers a much kinder view of Indians.<ref name=offenses/> "No, other Indians would have noticed these things, but Cooper's Indians never notice anything. Cooper thinks they are marvelous creatures for noticing, but he was almost always in error about his Indians. There was seldom a sane one among them."<ref>Twain, Mark, In defense of Harriet Shelley and Other Essays, Harper & Brothers, 1918. p. 68</ref> In his later travelogue Following the Equator (1897), Twain observes that in colonized lands all over the world, "savages" have always been wronged by "whites" in the most merciless ways, such as "robbery, humiliation, and slow, slow murder, through poverty and the white man's whiskey"; his conclusion is that "there are many humorous things in this world; among them the white man's notion that he is less savage than the other savages".<ref>Twain, Mark. 2008. Following the Equator. pp. 94–98</ref> In an expression that captures his East Indian experiences, he wrote, "So far as I am able to judge nothing has been left undone, either by man or Nature, to make India the most extraordinary country that the sun visits on his rounds. Where every prospect pleases, and only man is vile."<ref></ref>
Twain was also a staunch supporter of women's rights and an active campaigner for women's suffrage. His "Votes for Women" speech, in which he pressed for the granting of voting rights to women, is considered one of the most famous in history.<ref></ref>
Helen Keller benefited from Twain's support as she pursued her college education and publishing despite her disabilities and financial limitations. The two were friends for roughly 16 years.<ref></ref>
Through Twain's efforts, the Connecticut legislature voted a pension for Prudence Crandall, since 1995 Connecticut's official heroine, for her efforts towards the education of young African-American women in Connecticut. Twain also offered to purchase for her use her former house in Canterbury, home of the Canterbury Female Boarding School, but she declined.<ref></ref>
