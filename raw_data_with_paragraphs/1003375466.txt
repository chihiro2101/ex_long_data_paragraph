==Episodes==
==Cast and characters==
===Main===
* Louis Anthony Stevens (Shia LaBeouf) – Louis, the youngest Stevens sibling, is viewed as immature, rude, lazy, selfish, carefree, and extremely mischievous. He concocts elaborate schemes and inventions to make his life easier. His entire family is viewed as perfect next to him, which Louis resents. He is always pulling pranks with best friend Alan Twitty. His parents seem to favor his sister Ren and brother Donnie because of the great successes both have achieved, but his parents do love him dearly and try to defend him when possible. Louis tends to do "gross" things (weird faces, poor hygiene, picking nose, etc.), especially if it annoys Ren. Tawny Dean becomes his girlfriend at the end of the series. His birthday is on June 27 (as shown in episode 33).
* Ren Stevens (Christy Carlson Romano) – An intelligent, well-behaved, perfectionist 8th-grader, Ren is the middle sibling and only daughter. She is the classic overachiever, constantly running for hall monitor and class president while trying to keep Louis's schemes from becoming disasters and ruining her good-girl reputation. She is the head newscaster for "The Wombat Report" and spent a few weeks on her school's cheerleading squad. Ren is the editor of the school newspaper and the yearbook, a straight-A student, and Principal Wexler's highly valued assistant. She destresses by singing karaoke. Despite her top-student ranking, Ren got sentenced to, and served, detention on at least one occasion. Ren's favorite color is purple.
* Donnie Stevens (Nick Spano) – Ren and Louis' athletic big brother. Donnie is highly concerned with his appearance. His popularity, good looks, and superb athletic skills made him a heartthrob and legend at their school, even after his graduation. Although he excels in many sports, he's an airhead and rarely knows what is going on.
* Steve Stevens (Tom Virtue) – A quirky lawyer and the patriarch of the Stevens family. He played college football for Michigan State University with the nickname "Stiffie" Stevens. He used to be a wrestler for his school.
* Eileen Stevens (Donna Pescow) – The matriarch of the Stevens family; a successful, no-nonsense, American Jews state senator who launched a campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2002 and was narrowly defeated.
* Alan Twitty (A.J. Trauth) – Louis' closest best friend. Twitty is similar to Louis but usually isn't as extreme and often has to get Louis out of situations. Referred to as "Twitty" by his friends, he is on the basketball team and the baseball team, plays guitar, and also has success with girls. Twitty's catch phrases are "Dude" and "Sweet". When going undercover with Louis he goes by the name "Lars Honeytoast."
* Tawny Dean (Margo Harshman) – Louis' female best friend, and eventually his girlfriend. Tawny, at first, has no friends and is an outsider, until she meets Louis. Tawny usually dresses in goth clothing, unlike her classmates, and refuses to conform with others' trivial pursuits. She is usually the voice of reason.
* Ruby Mendel (Lauren Frost) – Ren's best friend who loves to gossip about crushes and dating couples. She once had a crush on Louis (while under the spell of a lucky penny), in the same episode that she had a crush on the boy band BBMak. Ruby speaks with a heavy Brooklyn accent.
===Recurring===
* Thomas "Tom" Gribalski (Fred Meyers) – Louis' nerdy best friend. When Louis cooks up a scheme, Tom usually tries to talk Louis out of it and usually doesn't play along. Also, Tom speaks in a very scientific, philosophical, and intelligent manner. He is commonly the victim of many pranks by Louis and Twitty. He calls his mother by her name (Doris). In season 3, Doris is seen playing the piano when Tom auditions for SACCY, a performing arts school.
* Monique Taylor (Kenya Williams) – Ren's other best friend. Monique is a perky cheerleader. Monique takes many things to extreme limits. She has a strong Southern accent.
* Nelson Minkler (Gary LeRoi Gray) – Ren's childhood best friend who seems to be allergic to everything and overprotects himself when he's outside. He is usually with Ren, and at times Donnie, but has spoken to Louis only once. He is fluent in French. Nelson was also Gray's character's name on The Cosby Show as a child.
* Bernard "Beans" Aranguren (Steven Anthony Lawrence) – The Stevens' extremely annoying neighbor, who comes into their home uninvited, makes himself at home, and refuses to leave. His love for bacon is a recurring theme, and in "Little Mr. Sacktown" he visits a bacon shack. He eventually turns into a sidekick for Louis and Twitty's schemes, usually double-crossing the two.
* Lawrence Anthony "Larry" Beale (Eric "Ty" Hodges) – Ren's nasty, equally-popular, charismatic, know-it-all rival in school. Larry hates Ren and always tries to destroy her reputation, but his schemes usually backfire. His favorite victim is Ren, but he occasionally tries to ruin Louis as well. Larry is secretly jealous of Ren and considers Louis a threat, but will never admit it. Larry is an Army brat. In the movie, he hinted he might even have romantic feelings for her, as he shows a bit of jealousy when it showed that Ren was sharing a kiss with an actor.
* Coach Terry Tugnut (Jim Wise) – The gym coach who is always tough on Louis but crazy about Donnie, Larry, and food. He loves to eat. Once he weighed over 300&nbsp;lbs. He is frequently the victim of Louis' pranks. Coach Tugnut often serves as Wexler's enforcer/sidekick. He is obsessed with dodgeball and with the three "major points" (arm, head, stomach). A running gag throughout the series is Coach Tugnut shouting, "Stevens!" when Louis causes trouble.
* Conrad Wexler (George Anthony Bell) – The principal of Lawrence Jr High. Principal Wexler favors Ren over the other students. They have had arguments, but they're good friends. Ren is his student assistant, while Louis drives him crazy. He usually makes Ren do his dirty work.
* Carla and Marla (Lisa Foiles and Krysten Leigh Jones) – Two girls who look up to Ren. Carla and Marla are both on the newspaper staff with Ren and Ruby. After the episode "Quest for Coolness", Carla and Marla are never seen or mentioned again.
* Bobby Deaver (Brandon Davis) – Ren's middle-school boyfriend; he appeared in seven episodes. Ren broke up with Bobby after Louis told her that he was cheating on her by dating Mandy Sanchez, a rival of Ren's.
* Ivan (Eric Jungmann) – Larry Beale's yes-man sidekick in the first season, although he occasionally serves as a yes-man for other popular kids, such as Blake Thompson in the episode "Louis in the Middle".
==Production==
The show was originally produced as a show called Spivey's Kid Brother.<ref></ref> A pilot was filmed in July 1999, and was later picked up by Disney Channel as Even Stevens. In the pilot episode, Disney had to dub out the name "Spivey" to "Stevens". In fact, in the gym class scene, a banner is visible in the background reading, "Home of Spivey and the Wild Wombats."
In the theme song of the show, clay animations of Louis and Ren turn their remote controls into lightsabers, alluding to Star Wars. Prior to this, Ren reads a TV guide with live-action photos of Christy Carlson Romano and Shia LaBeouf on the cover.
Lawrence Junior High is apparently a standard three-grade junior high school. Although the show lasted three seasons, the timeline of the show is only two school years, with Louis and his friends remaining in the 7th grade until some point after the middle of the second season. In several third-season episodes there are subtle references to an advance in the timeline that puts Ren and her friends in the 9th grade and Louis in the 8th grade. Ren finally graduates in The Even Stevens Movie.
Shia LaBeouf and Christy Carlson Romano are the only two actors to appear in all 65 episodes of the series.<ref></ref>
