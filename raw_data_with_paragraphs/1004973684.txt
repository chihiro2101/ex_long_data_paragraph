Antisocial personality disorder

==Treatment==
ASPD is considered to be among the most difficult personality disorders to treat.<ref name="Gabbard"></ref><ref></ref><ref name="Nolen-Hoeksema, Susan, 1959–2013"></ref> Rendering an effective treatment for ASPD is further complicated due to the inability to look at comparative studies between psychopathy and ASPD due to differing diagnostic criteria, differences in defining and measuring outcomes and a focus on treating incarcerated patients rather than those in the community.<ref></ref> Because of their very low or absent capacity for remorse, individuals with ASPD often lack sufficient motivation and fail to see the costs associated with antisocial acts.<ref name="Gabbard" /> They may only simulate remorse rather than truly commit to change: they can be Superficial charm and dishonest, and may manipulate staff and fellow patients during treatment.<ref name="Oldhamskodol"></ref> Studies have shown that outpatient therapy is not likely to be successful, but the extent to which persons with ASPD are entirely unresponsive to treatment may have been exaggerated.<ref></ref>
Most treatment done is for those in the criminal justice system to whom the treatment regimes are given as part of their imprisonment.<ref></ref> Those with ASPD may stay in treatment only as required by an external source, such as parole conditions.<ref name="Nolen-Hoeksema, Susan, 1959–2013"/> Residential programs that provide a carefully controlled environment of structure and supervision along with peer confrontation have been recommended.<ref name="Gabbard" /> There has been some research on the treatment of ASPD that indicated positive results for therapeutic interventions.<ref></ref> 
Psychotherapy also known as talk therapy is found to help treat patients with ASPD.<ref></ref>Schema therapy is also being investigated as a treatment for ASPD.<ref></ref> A review by Charles M. Borduin features the strong influence of Multisystemic therapy (MST) that could potentially improve this imperative issue. However, this treatment requires complete cooperation and participation of all family members.<ref name="Gatzke_2000"></ref> Some studies have found that the presence of ASPD does not significantly interfere with treatment for other disorders, such as substance abuse,<ref></ref> although others have reported contradictory findings.<ref></ref>
Therapists working with individuals with ASPD may have considerable negative feelings toward patients with extensive histories of aggressive, exploitative, and abusive behaviors.<ref name="Gabbard" /> Rather than attempt to develop a sense of conscience in these individuals, which is extremely difficult considering the nature of the disorder, therapeutic techniques are focused on rational and utilitarian arguments against repeating past mistakes. These approaches would focus on the tangible, material value of prosocial behavior and abstaining from antisocial behavior. However, the impulsive and aggressive nature of those with this disorder may limit the effectiveness of even this form of therapy.<ref></ref>
The use of medications in treating antisocial personality disorder is still poorly explored, and no medications have been approved by the FDA to specifically treat ASPD.<ref name="aspd meds"></ref> A 2020 Cochrane review of studies that explored the use of pharmaceuticals in ASPD patients, of which 8 studies met the selection criteria for review, concluded that the current body of evidence was inconclusive for recommendations concerning the use of pharmaceuticals in treating the various issues of ASPD.<ref></ref> Nonetheless, psychiatric medications such as antipsychotics, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers can be used to control symptoms such as aggression and impulsivity, as well as treat disorders that may co-occur with ASPD for which medications are indicated.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
==Prognosis==
According to Professor Emily Simonoff of the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience there are many variables that are consistently connected to ASPD, such as: childhood hyperactivity and conduct disorder, criminality in adulthood, lower IQ scores and reading problems.<ref name="pmid14754823"></ref> The strongest relationship between these variables and ASPD are childhood hyperactivity and conduct disorder. Additionally, children who grow up with a predisposition of ASPD and interact with other delinquent children are likely to later be diagnosed with ASPD.<ref name="Azeredo_2019"></ref><ref name="Baglivio_2015"></ref> Like many disorders, genetics play a role in this disorder but the environment holds an undeniable role in its development.
Boys are twice as likely to meet all of the diagnostic criteria for ASPD than girls (40% versus 25%) and they will often start showing symptoms of the disorder much earlier in life.<ref name="Fisher_2020"></ref> Children that do not show symptoms of the disease through age 15 will not develop ASPD later in life.<ref name="Fisher_2020" /> If adults exhibit milder symptoms of ASPD, it is likely that they never met the criteria for the disorder in their childhood and were consequently never diagnosed. Overall, symptoms of ASPD tend to peak in late-teens and early twenties, but can often reduce or improve through age 40.<ref name="medline" />
ASPD is ultimately a lifelong disorder that leads has chronic consequences, though some of these can be moderated over time.<ref name="Fisher_2020" /> There may be a high variability of the long-term outlook of antisocial personality disorder. The treatment of this disorder can be successful, but it entails unique difficulties. It is unlikely to see rapid change especially when the condition is severe. In fact, past studies revealed that remission rates were small, with up to only 31% rates of improvement instead of remittance.<ref name="Fisher_2020" /> As a result of the characteristics of ASPD (e.g., displaying charm in effort of personal gain, manipulation), patients seeking treatment (mandated or otherwise) may appear to be "cured" in order to get out of treatment. According to definitions found in the DSM-5, people with ASPD can be deceitful and intimidating in their relationships.<ref name=":9"></ref> When they are caught doing something wrong, they often appear to be unaffected and unemotional about the consequences.<ref name=":9" /> Over time, continual behavior that lacks empathy and concern may lead to someone with ASPD taking advantage of the kindness of others, including his or her therapist.<ref name=":9" />
Without proper treatment, individuals suffering with ASPD could lead a life that brings about harm to themselves or others. This can be detrimental to their families and careers. ASPD victims suffer from lack of interpersonal skills (e.g., lack of remorse, lack of empathy, lack of emotional-processing skills).<ref></ref><ref></ref> As a result of the inability to create and maintain healthy relationships due to the lack of interpersonal skills, individuals with ASPD may find themselves in predicaments such as divorce, unemployment, homelessness and even premature death by suicide.<ref name = "Mueser_2006"></ref><ref name="Krasnova_2019"></ref> They also see higher rates of committed crime, reaching peaks in their late teens and often committing higher-severity crimes in their younger ages of diagnoses.<ref name="Fisher_2020" /> Comorbidity of other mental illnesses such as Depression or Substance use disorder is prevalent among ASPD victims. People with ASPD are also more likely to commit homicides and other crimes.<ref name="Fisher_2020" /> Those who are imprisoned longer often see higher rates of improvement with symptoms of ASPD than others who have been imprisoned for a shorter amount of time.<ref name="Fisher_2020" />
According to one study, aggressive tendencies show in about 72% of all male patients diagnosed with ASPD. About 29% of the men studied with ASPD also showed a prevalence of pre-meditated aggression.<ref name="Azevedo_2020"></ref> Based on the evidence in the study, the researchers concluded that aggression in patients with ASPD is mostly impulsive, though there are some long-term evidences of pre-meditated aggressions.<ref name="Azevedo_2020" /> It often occurs that those with higher psychopathic traits will exhibit the pre-meditated aggressions to those around them.<ref name="Azevedo_2020" /> Over the course of a patient’s life with ASPD, he or she can exhibit this aggressive behavior and harm those close to him or her.
Additionally, many people (especially adults) who have been diagnosed with ASPD become burdens to their close relatives, peers, and caretakers. Harvard Medical School recommends that time and resources be spent treating victims who have been affected by someone with ASPD, because the patient with ASPD may not respond to the administered therapies.<ref name=":9" />  In fact, a patient with ASPD may only accept treatment when ordered by a court, which will make their course of treatment difficult and severe. Because of the challenges in treatment, the patient's family and close friends must take an active role in decisions about therapies that are offered to the patient. Ultimately, there must be a group effort to aid the long-term effects of the disorder.<ref></ref>
==Epidemiology==
As seen in two North American studies and two European studies, ASPD is most commonly seen in men rather than women, with men being three to five times more likely to be diagnosed with ASPD than women.<ref name="NCCMH_2010"></ref><ref name="Fisher_2020" /> The prevalence of ASPD is even higher in selected populations, like prisons, where there is a preponderance of violent offenders. It has been found that the prevalence of ASPD among prisoners is just under 50%.<ref name="NCCMH_2010" /> Similarly, the prevalence of ASPD is higher among patients in alcohol or other drug (AOD) abuse treatment programs than in the general population, suggesting a link between ASPD and AOD abuse and dependence.<ref name="NCCMH_2010" /><ref name = "Mueser_2006" /> As part of the Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) study, men with ASPD were found to be three to five times more likely to abuse alcohol and illicit drugs than those men without ASPD. While ASPD occurs more often in men than women, there was found to be increased severity of this abuse in women with ASPD. In a study conducted with both men and women with ASPD, women were more likely to misuse substances compared to their male counterparts.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
Individuals with ASPD are at an elevated risk for suicide.<ref name="Krasnova_2019" /> Some studies suggest this increase in suicidality is in part due to the association between suicide and symptoms or trends within ASPD, such as criminality and substance abuse.<ref></ref> Offspring of ASPD victims are also at risk.<ref name="vauthors_2016"></ref> Some research suggests that negative or traumatic experiences in childhood, perhaps as a result of the choices a parent with ASPD might make, can be a predictor of delinquency later on in the child's life.<ref name="Baglivio_2015" /> Additionally, with variability between situations, children of a parent with ASPD may suffer consequences of delinquency if they're raised in an environment in which crime and violence is common.<ref name="Azeredo_2019" /> Suicide is a leading cause of death among youth who display antisocial behavior, especially when mixed with delinquency. Incarceration, which could come as a consequence of actions from a victim of ASPD, is a predictor for suicide ideation in youth.<ref name="vauthors_2016" /><ref></ref>
==History==
The first version of the DSM in 1952 listed sociopathic personality disturbance. This category was for individuals who were considered ".ill primarily in terms of society and of conformity with the prevailing milieu, and not only in terms of personal discomfort and relations with other individuals".<ref></ref> There were four subtypes, referred to as "reactions": antisocial, dyssocial, sexual, and addiction. The antisocial reaction was said to include people who were "always in trouble" and not learning from it, maintaining "no loyalties", frequently callous and lacking responsibility, with an ability to "rationalize" their behavior. The category was described as more specific and limited than the existing concepts of "constitutional psychopathic state" or "psychopathic personality" which had had a very broad meaning; the narrower definition was in line with criteria advanced by Hervey M. Cleckley from 1941, while the term sociopathic had been advanced by George Partridge in 1928 when studying the early environmental influence on psychopaths. Partridge discovered the correlation between antisocial psychopathic disorder and parental rejection experienced in early childhood.<ref></ref>
The DSM-II in 1968 rearranged the categories and "antisocial personality" was now listed as one of ten personality disorders but still described similarly, to be applied to individuals who are: "basically unsocialized", in repeated conflicts with society, incapable of significant loyalty, selfish, irresponsible, unable to feel guilt or learn from prior experiences, and who tend to blame others and rationalize.<ref></ref> The manual preface contains "special instructions" including "Antisocial personality should always be specified as mild, moderate, or severe." The DSM-II warned that a history of legal or social offenses was not by itself enough to justify the diagnosis, and that a "group delinquent reaction" of childhood or adolescence or "social maladjustment without manifest psychiatric disorder" should be ruled out first. The dyssocial personality type was relegated in the DSM-II to "dyssocial behavior" for individuals who are predatory and follow more or less criminal pursuits, such as racketeers, dishonest gamblers, prostitutes, and dope peddlers. (DSM-I classified this condition as sociopathic personality disorder, dyssocial type). It would later resurface as the name of a diagnosis in the ICD manual produced by the WHO, later spelled dissocial personality disorder and considered approximately equivalent to the ASPD diagnosis.<ref> urltoken International Handbook on Psychopathic Disorders and the Law, Volume 1, Alan Felthous, Henning Sass, 15 April 2008, e.g. Pgs 24 – 26</ref>
The DSM-III in 1980 included the full term antisocial personality disorder and, as with other disorders, there was now a full checklist of symptoms focused on observable behaviors to enhance consistency in diagnosis between different psychiatrists ('inter-rater reliability'). The ASPD symptom list was based on the Research Diagnostic Criteria developed from the so-called Feighner Criteria from 1972, and in turn largely credited to influential research by sociologist Lee Robins published in 1966 as "Deviant Children Grown Up".<ref></ref> However, Robins has previously clarified that while the new criteria of prior childhood conduct problems came from her work, she and co-researcher psychiatrist Patricia O'Neal got the diagnostic criteria they used from Lee's husband the psychiatrist Eli Robins, one of the authors of the Feighner criteria who had been using them as part of diagnostic interviews.<ref> urltoken The DSM-IV Personality Disorders W. John Livesley, Guilford Press, 1995, Page 135</ref>
The DSM-IV maintained the trend for behavioral antisocial symptoms while noting "This pattern has also been referred to as psychopathy, sociopathy, or dyssocial personality disorder" and re-including in the 'Associated Features' text summary some of the underlying personality traits from the older diagnoses. The DSM-5 has the same diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. The Pocket Guide to the DSM-5 Diagnostic Exam suggests that a person with ASPD may present "with psychopathic features" if he or she exhibits "a lack of anxiety or fear and a bold, efficacious interpersonal style".<ref name="dsm-5 pocket guide" />

Elsewhere, Millon differentiates ten subtypes (partially overlapping with the above) – covetous, risk-taking, malevolent, tyrannical, malignant, disingenuous, explosive, and abrasive – but specifically stresses that "the number 10 is by no means 
special&nbsp;. Taxonomies may be put forward at levels that are more coarse or more fine-grained."<ref name = "Stout_2006" />
