==History==
The origin of falafel is controversial.<ref name="Slow food"></ref> The dish most likely originated in Egypt, possibly influenced by similar Indian dishes.<ref></ref><ref name=ynet></ref><ref name="Lee 2019"></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> There is a legend that a fava bean version was eaten by Copts as early as the 4th century during Lent, but there is no documentary evidence for this. It has been speculated that its history may go back to Pharaonic Egypt.<ref name="Egyptian food and drink"></ref>However, the earliest written references to falafel from Egyptian sources date to the 19th century,<ref name=Raviv></ref><ref></ref><ref name=solomonov></ref> and oil was probably too expensive to use for deep frying in ancient Egypt.<ref name=solomonov/><ref></ref>
As Alexandria is a port city, it was possible to export the dish and name to other areas in the Middle East.<ref></ref> The dish later migrated northwards to the Levant, where chickpeas replaced the fava beans.<ref name="Kantor"></ref><ref name="MacLeod"></ref> 
===Middle East===
Falafel grew to become a common form of street food or fast food in Egypt as well as the Levant.<ref></ref> The croquettes are regularly eaten as part of meze. During Ramadan, falafel balls are sometimes eaten as part of the iftar, the meal that breaks the daily fast after sunset.<ref name="Vegetarian Journal 2001-04-01"/> Falafel became so popular that McDonald's for a time served a "McFalafel" in its breakfast menu all over Egypt.<ref></ref> Falafel is still popular with the Copts, who cook large volumes during religious holidays.<ref name="Roden"/>
Debates over the history of falafel have sometimes devolved into political discussions about the relationship between Arabs and Israelis.<ref name="Kantor"/> In modern times, falafel has been considered a national dish of Egypt,<ref></ref> Palestine,<ref></ref><ref></ref> and of Israel.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Resentment exists amongst many Palestinians for what they see as the appropriation of their dish by Israelis.<ref name=Pilcher></ref> Additionally, the Lebanese Industrialists' Association has raised assertions of copyright infringement against Israel concerning falafel.<ref name="Kantor"/><ref name="MacLeod"/><ref></ref>

==Preparation and variations==
Falafel is made from Vicia faba or chickpeas, or a combination. Chickpeas are common in most Middle Eastern countries.<ref name="Evening Standard 2002-2-05-02"></ref> The dish is usually made with chickpeas in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and Palestine.<ref name=Roden></ref><ref></ref><ref name=Aytop106></ref> This version is the most popular in the West.<ref name="Roden"/> The Egyptian variety uses only fava beans.<ref></ref>
When chickpeas are used, they are not cooked prior to use (cooking the chickpeas will cause the falafel to fall apart, requiring adding some flour to use as a binder). Instead they are soaked (sometimes with baking soda) overnight, then ground together with various ingredients such as parsley, scallions, and garlic.<ref name="Roden"/> Spices such as cumin and coriander are often added to the beans for added flavor.<ref></ref> The dried fava beans are soaked in water and then stone ground with leek, parsley, green coriander, cumin and dry coriander.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The mixture is shaped into balls or patties. This can be done by hand or with a tool called an aleb falafel (falafel mould).<ref name="Oxford Press"/><ref name="Evening Standard 2002-2-05-02"/> The mixture is usually deep fried, or it can be oven baked.
Falafel is typically ball-shaped, but is sometimes made in other shapes, particularly doughnut-shaped. The inside of falafel may be green (from green herbs such as parsley or green onion), or tan.
When served as a sandwich, falafel is often wrapped with flatbread or stuffed in a hollow pita,<ref name=fluffy></ref> or it can be served with flat or unleavened bread.<ref></ref> Tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, and other garnishes can be added.<ref name="Winget 2004"/><ref>Claudia Roden, The Book of Jewish Food: An Odyssey from Samarkand to New York , New York, Knopf, 1997, 688 p. ( ) , p. 273 .</ref> Falafel is commonly accompanied by tahini sauce.<ref name="Roden"/>
Pita falafel was popularized after Israel's independence and in the 1950s by Jewish Yemeni immigrants. Yemeni Jews are the first to introduce the concept of falafel served in a pita.<ref>Israeli Soul: Easy, Essential, Delicious. Michael Solomonov, Steven Cook. Page 23</ref> An October 19, 1939 Palestine Post article is the first mention of the concept of falafels served in a pita bread.<ref>Encyclopedia of Jewish Food, Gil Marks, HMH, 2010</ref>
==Nutrition==
When made with chickpeas, falafel is high in protein, complex carbohydrates, and fiber.<ref name="Webb 2004"></ref> Key nutrients are calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, copper, manganese, vitamin C, thiamine, pantothenic acid, vitamin B, and folate. Phytochemicals include beta-carotene.<ref></ref> Falafel is high in soluble fiber, which has been shown to be effective in lowering blood cholesterol.<ref name=way2eat></ref><ref name=heart></ref>
Chickpeas are low in fat and contain no cholesterol, but a considerable amount of fat is absorbed during the frying process. Falafel can be baked to reduce the high fat content associated with frying.<ref name=vegtimes1/><ref name="Winget 2004"></ref>
