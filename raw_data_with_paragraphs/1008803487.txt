Baháʼí House of Worship

==Description==
The Bahá'í House of Worship was first mentioned in Baháʼu'lláh's book of laws, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, as the Mas͟hriqu'l-Ad͟hkár "Dawning-place of the remembrance of God"), and the details of the institution were then elaborated by both Baháʼu'lláh and his successor, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá.<ref name="iranica" />
Baháʼí literature directs that a House of Worship should be built in each city and town, and emphasizes that its doors must be open to all regardless of religion, or any other distinction. The Bahá'í laws emphasize that the spirit of the House of Worship must be a gathering place where people of all religions may worship God without denominational restrictions.<ref name="iranica" /> The Bahá'í laws also stipulate that only the holy scriptures of the Bahá'í Faith and other religions can be read or chanted inside in any language; while readings and prayers may be set to music by choirs, no musical instruments may be played inside.<ref name="iranica" /> Furthermore, no sermons may be delivered, and no ritualistic ceremonies practiced.<ref name="iranica" />
All Bahá'í temples share certain architectural elements, some of which are specified by Bahá'í scripture. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá stipulated that an essential architectural character of a House of Worship be that it requires to have a 9 (number) shape (nonagon).<ref></ref>
While all current Bahá'í Houses of Worship have a dome, they are not regarded as an essential part of their architecture.<ref>Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer, urltoken pg 311 Lights of Divine Guidance (volume 1).</ref> Bahá'í scripture also states that no pictures, statues or images may be displayed within the House of Worship and no pulpits or altars incorporated as an architectural feature (readers may stand behind simple portable lectern).<ref name="iranica" /> To date all the Houses of Worship built or planned have a single, undivided room under their dome. Furthermore, in all ten, the seats in the auditorium face the Shrine of Baháʼu'lláh in Acre, Israel. While each of the Houses of Worship is unique, the designs, through the selection of materials, landscaping and architecture, reflect the indigenous cultural, social and environmental elements of their location, to a greater or lesser degree.<ref name="iranica" />
Bahá'í literature also stipulates that the Houses of Worship be surrounded by a complex of humanitarian, educational, and charitable institutions such as schools, hospitals, homes for the elderly, universities, hostels, and other social and humanitarian institutions to serve the areas in which they stand.<ref name="iranica" /><ref></ref>
Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion in the first half the 20th century, stated that the functions of the House of Worship would be complementary to those of the Haziratu'l-Quds Bahá'í centres), and that it would be desirable if both these buildings would be on the same site.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
He also describes the future interaction between the Mas͟hriqu'l-Ad͟hkár (worship) and its dependencies (service) as "capable of removing the ills that have so long and so grievously afflicted humanity".<ref></ref>
The ten existing Houses of Worship were built as the Bahá'í community could support their construction through voluntary contributions. There are no collections during services and only Bahá'ís are permitted to contribute to the Bahá'í funds, including funds for the construction and maintenance of the House of Worship. The Houses of Worship are administered and maintained by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the country in which they are located.<ref name="iranica" />
The Shrine of the Báb and other buildings at the Baháʼí World Centre are not Houses of Worship, although tourists often mistakenly refer to the Shrine as a Bahá'í temple.
== Destroyed House of Worship in Turkmenistan ==
The first Bahá'í House of Worship was built in the city of Ashgabat, then ruled by Russia and now the capital of Turkmenistan. It was started in 1902 and completed in 1908. The design was prepared by Ostad Ali-Akbar Banna, and the construction was supervised by Vakílu'd-Dawlih, later named one of the nineteen Apostles of Baháʼu'lláh.<ref name="iranica" /><ref name="us_ashkabad"></ref>
ʻIshqábád is located in the desert plain of western Turkmenistan near the foothills of the Alborz Mountains. Under the protection and freedom given by the Russian authorities, the number of Bahá'ís there rose to over 1,000 and for the first time anywhere in the world a true Bahá'í community was established, with its own schools, medical facilities, cemetery, etc. Eventually the Bahá'ís in ʻIshqábád decided to build the institution of the spiritual and social heart of the Bahá'í community: the Mas͟hriqu'l-Ad͟hkár.
The House of Worship itself was surrounded by gardens. At the four corners of the garden were four buildings: a school, a hostel where travelling Bahá'ís were entertained, a small hospital, and a building for groundskeepers. The Bahá'ís lived as much as possible in proximity to the House of Worship. It was the centre of the community materially, as well as spiritually. The House of Worship in ʻIshqábád has been the only house of worship thus far to have the humanitarian subsidiaries associated with the institution built alongside it.<ref name="us_ashkabad" />
After serving the community for two decades, the House of Worship was expropriated by the Soviet authorities in 1928 and leased back to the Bahá'ís. This lasted until 1938, when it was fully secularized and turned into an art museum. The 1948 Ashgabat earthquake seriously damaged the building and rendered it unsafe; the heavy rains of the following years weakened the structure, and it was demolished in 1963 and the site converted into a public park.<ref name="iranica" />
==Continental Houses of Worship==
There are currently ten Bahá'í Houses of Worship. The newest Bahá'í House of Worship, located in the municipality of Villa Rica in the Cauca Department, Colombia, opened its doors on July 23, 2018.
===Wilmette, Illinois, U.S.===
The cornerstone for the Bahá'í House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois was brought to the site by Nettie Tobin and accepted in 1912 by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá during his only visit to the United States and Canada. Construction began in 1921 and was completed in 1953, with a delay of several years during the Great Depression and World War II. The Wilmette House of Worship is the largest and the oldest surviving Bahá'í House of Worship. Known by Baha'is as the "Mother Temple of the West" and formally as the "Bahá'í House of Worship for the North American Continent", it stands in north suburban Cook County, on the shores of Lake Michigan, at . The cladding is made of white portland cement concrete with both clear and white quartz aggregate. It has received numerous design awards, and is a prominent Chicago-area landmark. In 1978, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.<ref name="nris"></ref>
The height of the auditorium is 138 feet (42 m), and the diameter of the dome is 90 feet (27.5 m). From ground level, which is 597 feet above sea level just on the west side of Sheridan Road, the building stands approximately 164 feet tall above ground level. The auditorium seats 1,192 visitors.<ref>Visitor's Center brochure, October 2007.</ref> Like some other Bahá'í temples, it has a gallery balcony from which choirs or soloists may perform. No instrumental music is allowed during services in the auditorium, although all kinds of music may be performed in the meeting room below. In general, no videography, photography, or any other activity inconsistent with quiet meditation is allowed in the auditorium. Devotional programs are held daily at 9:15&nbsp;a.m. and 12:30&nbsp;p.m.<ref>Whitmore (1984).</ref>
The Bahá'í House of Worship is a place of worship for all people. The only decorative art inside and out involves shapes and designs made by intersecting lines. There are no images of people or places. The building itself is decorated inside and out with verses from the Baha'i Writings, all of them by Baháʼu'lláh. As there are nine entrances to the building, there are nine verses above the doors and nine inside the buildings above the alcoves.
The verses outside are engraved into the stone, in large legible letters. Above the doors are small engraved versions of the "Greatest Name", one of several Baháʼí symbols and an elaborate decorative design that includes the letters ABHA, representing the prayer "Alláh u Abhá" (God is Most Glorious) in Arabic. It is the numerical value of these four letters in the words abha and baha (for Baháʼu'lláh) that add up to total nine, one of reasons Bahá'í Houses of Worship are nine-sided.
The most decorative element on the outside of the building is the tracery on the nine towers. These are intertwined with the generally recognized symbols of many world religions, including the Cross, the star and crescent, the Star of David, and the original swastika design, an ancient symbol having arms bent at right angles, used for thousands of years as a representative symbol of world religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The only decorative symbol inside the auditorium is a large, lighted version of the Greatest Name in the exact center of the inside of the dome.
For many years the Bahá'í House of Worship was associated with a "home for the aged", operated by the U.S. Bahá'í community. The Bahá'í Home has since closed, although the building remains in use for a local Baha'i School and regional training center.<ref></ref>
On April 30, 2007, the Bahá'í House of Worship was named one of the Seven Wonders of Illinois by the Illinois Bureau of Tourism representing the Chicago metropolitan area.<ref>.</ref>
===Kampala, Uganda===
The Mother Temple of Africa is situated on Kikaaya, in Kawempe Division, in northern Kampala, Uganda's capital and largest city. It was designed by Mason Remey. Its foundation stone was laid in January 1958, and it was dedicated on January 13, 1961.
The building is more than 130 feet (39 m) high, and over 100 meters in diameter at the base. The dome, composed of lace-like tiles, rises over 124 feet (37 m) high and is 44 feet (13 m) in diameter.

The site is in the village of Bahapur, in the National Capital Territory of Delhi. The major part of the funds needed to buy this land was donated by Ardishír Rustampúr from Hyderabad, Sindh (Pakistan),<ref></ref> who gave his entire life savings for this purpose in 1953.<ref></ref>
This House of Worship is generally referred to as the "Lotus Temple" by Bahá'ís and non-Bahá'ís alike. In India, during the Hindu festival Durga Puja, several times a replica of the Lotus Temple has been made as a pandal, a temporary structure set up to venerate the goddess Durga.<ref></ref>

==Local and National Houses of Worship==
In 2012 the Universal House of Justice announced plans for the first local and national Bahá'í Houses of Worship to be built.<ref name="R-2012"/> The first two national Houses of Worship would be in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Papua New Guinea, while the first five local Houses of Worship Battambang, Cambodia; Bihar Sharif, India; Matunda Soy, Kenya; Cauca, Colombia; and Tanna (island).<ref name="R-2012"/> The Universal House of Justice characterized the Bahá'í communities chosen to host these new temples as unique in the world:
<blockquote>The Mashriqu'l-Adhkár, described by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá as “one of the most vital institutions of the world”, weds two essential, inseparable aspects of Bahá'í life: worship and service. The union of these two is also reflected in the coherence that exists among the community-building features of the Plan, particularly the burgeoning of a devotional spirit that finds expression in gatherings for prayer and an educational process that builds capacity for service to humanity. The correlation of worship and service is especially pronounced in those clusters around the world where Bahá'í communities have significantly grown in size and vitality, and where engagement in social action is apparent. . It is within these clusters that, in the coming years, the emergence of a local Mashriqu'l-Adhkár can be contemplated.<ref></ref></blockquote>
=== Battambang, Cambodia ===
The Battambang, Cambodia temple was the world's first local Bahá'í House of Worship to be completed. The temple was designed by Cambodian architect Sochet Vitou Tang, who is a practicing Buddhist, and integrates distinctive Cambodian architectural principles.<ref></ref> A dedication ceremony and official opening conference took place on September 1–2, 2017, attended by Cambodian dignitaries, locals, and representatives of Bahá'í communities throughout southeast Asia.<ref>

A Bahá'í House of Worship or Bahá'í temple is a place of worship of the Baháʼí Faith. It is also referred to by the name Mashriqu'l-Adhkár , an Arabic phrase meaning "Dawning-place of the remembrance of God."<ref name="Smith"></ref> The teachings of the religion envisage Houses of Worship being surrounded by a number of dependencies dedicated to social, humanitarian, educational, and scientific pursuits, although none has yet been built to such an extent.<ref name="momen"></ref><ref name="iranica"></ref> The Houses of Worship are open to the public, and are exclusively reserved for worship, where sermons are prohibited and only scriptural texts may be read or chanted. Most Bahá'í meetings occur in local Haziratu'l-Quds (commonly known as Bahá'í centres), individuals' homes, or rented facilities,<ref name="momen" /> though plans for the first five local Houses of Worship were announced in 2012, with that in Battambang, Cambodia being the first to open, in 2017.
Eleven Bahá'í Houses of Worship have been built around the world (including one in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan that has since been destroyed).<ref></ref> Of the ten currently standing, eight are continental temples and two are local temples. Two of the continental temples, the Lotus Temple and the Santiago Bahá'í Temple, have won numerous architectural awards. In the Ridván Message for 2012, the Universal House of Justice announced new initiatives for future Houses of Worship, calling for the first national and locally based institutions.<ref name="R-2012"></ref> , the groundbreaking for the first "national Mashriqu'l-Adhkárs" has occurred, while the first two local Houses of Worship have been opened. Bahá'í communities own many properties where Houses of Worship remain to be constructed as the Bahá'í community grows and develops further.
