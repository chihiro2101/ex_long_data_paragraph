Mervyn King, Baron King of Lothbury

==Early life and pre-bank career==
Mervyn King is a son of Eric King, a railway porter who retrained as a geography teacher after the war, and Kathleen (née Passingham).<ref name="game"/><ref name="Interviews 12.03.2012"></ref> He was born in Chesham Bois, Buckinghamshire, and studied at Warstones Junior School Wolverhampton and then on to Wolverhampton Grammar School, King's College, Cambridge (gaining a first-class degree in economics in 1969; MA), St John's College, Cambridge, and Harvard (as a Kennedy Scholar).<ref name="bankbio"> urltoken Bank of England profile ; accessed 2 March 2011.</ref><ref></ref> Whilst at Cambridge, King was treasurer of the Cambridge University Liberal Club in 1968.<ref name="bankbio"/><ref> urltoken Profile, keynessociety.wordpress.com; accessed 30- March 2015.</ref>
After graduation, he worked as a researcher on the Cambridge Growth Project with future Nobel Laureate Richard Stone and Terry Barker at the University of Cambridge. He then taught at the University of Birmingham and was a visiting professor at Harvard and MIT where he shared an office with then Assistant Professor Ben Bernanke. From October 1984 he was Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics where he founded the Financial Markets Group.<ref name="bankbio"/> In 1981, he was one of the 364 economists who signed a letter to The Times condemning Geoffrey Howe's 1981 Budget.<ref name="BBC 13.03.2006"></ref><ref name="Times 07.02.2012"></ref>
==Bank of England==
King joined the bank in March 1991 as chief economist and executive director, after being a non-executive director from 1990 to 1991. He was appointed Deputy Governor in 1997, taking up his post on 1 June 1998. In the same year, King became a member of the Group of Thirty. An ex-officio member of the bank's interest-rate setting Monetary Policy Committee since its inception in 1997, King took part in its monthly meetings. He succeeded Edward George as governor on 1 July 2003, and was also the first incumbent governor of the Bank of England to be received in audience with Queen Elizabeth II.<ref></ref>
===Late 2000s financial crisis===
After becoming Bank governor, King explained that Bank of England policy was "similar to that of the Federal Reserve" under Alan Greenspan. Greenspan described his approach as "mitigating the fallout from the bursting of a bubble when it occurs".<ref name="king_2004"></ref> King agreed with Alan Greenspan that, "It is hard to identify asset price 'bubbles'."<ref name="king_2004"/>
Other warnings about the UK housing market followed, including from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in 2004<ref></ref> and the OECD in 2005.<ref></ref> King noted the "unusually large" difference between the RPIX and CPI at the beginning of 2004 (the latter does not include house prices as part of its inflation measure, whilst the former does),<ref></ref> and, six months later, that UK house prices had risen "to levels which are well above what most people would regard as sustainable in the longer term", having increased by more than 20% over the preceding year and more than 100% over the preceding five.<ref></ref>
In 2005, The Economist described the run-up in UK house prices as forming part of "the biggest bubble in history",<ref></ref> and, by October 2007—when the UK housing bubble was at its peak<ref></ref> — the IMF was reporting that the UK housing market was "overpriced by up to 40 per cent".<ref></ref> As noted by the OECD, house-price volatility "can raise systemic risks as the banking and mortgage sectors are vulnerable to fluctuations in house prices due to their exposure to the housing market."<ref></ref>
Dean Baker in The American Prospect said the failure by Greenspan and King to tackle the bubbles in their respective countries' housing markets resulted in catastrophic "fallout" when the bubbles burst, resulting in the worst recessions in both countries since the Great Depression.<ref></ref> UK–US inaction may be compared to action taken by China<ref></ref><ref name="FT 18.11.2011"></ref><ref></ref><ref name="FT 28.12.2011"></ref><ref>.</ref> and Australia.<ref name="OzQuote"></ref>
Another result of the financial crisis was King's rejection of the bank's devout focus on price stability, or inflation targeting, a policy that was instituted after Black Wednesday in 1992 and that was continued by King after becoming governor in 2003.<ref></ref> One of the two early lessons King drew from crisis were that "price stability does not guarantee stability of the economy as a whole" and that "the instruments used to pursue financial stability are in need of sharpening and refining."<ref name="King speech394"></ref>
The 2012 Financial Services Bill, in transferring the majority of macroprudential regulatory powers from the FSA to the bank, will grant the Financial Policy Committee (chaired by King) the power to curb lending in booms, including placing limits on the public's access to mortgages.<ref name="Indie 23.01.2012"></ref> A former, senior BoE official summed up the bank's pre-crisis performance: "How can you look back with the benefit of hindsight and see it as a success? We were responsible for financial stability and we utterly failed to take any avoiding action against the greatest financial crisis in our lifetimes".<ref name="Interviews 12.03.2012"/> David Blanchflower said that, even as late as the summer of 2008, King did not even see the financial crisis coming.<ref name="DaBl 18Apr2012"></ref>
In its review of Bank of England accountability, one of the major complaints of the Treasury Select Committee was the bank's refusal to undertake an internal review of its performance during the financial crisis.<ref name="FT 23.01.2012a"></ref> Such a review would pose difficulties since evidence on how its most senior policymakers arrived at their decisions was destroyed as a matter of course.<ref name="FT 23.01.2012a"/> By contrast, the United States publishes the Federal Reserve's deliberations with a five-year lag, which have provided "the most detailed picture yet of how top officials at the central bank didn't anticipate the storm about to hit the U.S. economy and the global financial system."<ref name="WSJ 13.01.2012"></ref> As in the UK, the US central bank's failure led to a new regulatory framework, the 2010 Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.<ref name="WSJ 13.01.2012"/>
====Response to crisis====
King argued that when the financial crisis and bank meltdown hit in autumn 2008, he and other Western central bankers "prevented a Great Depression", in part by cutting interest rates to virtually zero. The Economist agreed, saying that he "has a point".<ref name="Economist 10.12.2011"></ref> A 2012 review of actions taken by Western central banks in the face of the crisis also supported King's claim.<ref></ref> The bank has faced criticism, however, for the pace of the rate cuts, which took five months from the beginning of October 2008 to get down from 5.0% to 0.5%, where they remained for several years.<ref name="Guardian 03.02.2012"></ref><ref name="rate_history"></ref>
After becoming only the second Bank of England governor to speak to the TUC in its 142-year history, King conceded that people were "entitled to be angry" about unemployment and the bank bailout.<ref name="BBC 15.09.2010"></ref>
King has been scathing about the banking sector since it crashed, especially its "breathtaking" £1 trillion bailout and its continuation of bonus awards in 2009, calling for a serious review of banking's structure and regulation.<ref name="Guardian 21.10.2009"></ref>
In a The Daily Telegraph interview in March 2011, King said banks had "put profits before people", that failure to reform the sector could result in another financial crisis, and that traditional manufacturing industries have a more "moral" way of operating.<ref name="Interview 05.03.2011"></ref> In an interview with The Times in March 2012, he said that the banks are still in denial about the "very real and wholly understandable" anger that is felt at their behaviour,<ref name="Denial 12.03.2012"></ref> Bankers have not been happy with his excoriating views and insistence on avoiding moral hazard, but King insists that "market discipline can't apply to everyone except banks", pinpointing the banks' sense of grievance on their finding it "very, very difficult to face up to the failure of their banking model".<ref name="Denial 12.03.2012"/>
With King's term as governor ending in 2013, top UK banks have warned that unless a less "hostile" figure is found as a successor, they may feel it necessary to move abroad.<ref name="Times 14.03.2012"></ref><ref name="IndiePA 21.02.2012"></ref> On 26 November 2012, Mark Carney was named as King's successor.
====Banks bailout====
King had faced accusations of refusing funding to the Northern Rock Bank, precipitating a run on that bank, a situation not seen in the UK since 1914.<ref name="NS 03.10.2011">.</ref> King later said that it had been the chancellor, Alistair Darling, not he, who had the final word on refusing the necessary help to Northern Rock.<ref name="Guard 06.11.2007"></ref> In his urltoken review of King's tenure as governor, Times journalist David Wighton wrote:
In his memoirs, Alistair Darling was critical of King for emphasising moral hazard—the doctrine of not saving the banks from the consequences of their own mistakes—instead of rescuing the banks by pumping money into them as the banking-system meltdown occurred in autumn 2008.<ref name="STimes 04.09.2011"></ref> Despite his refusal to give funding to the retail banks, he retained his job, and submitted in defence to a Treasury Select Committee (New York Times/Financial Times, 20 September 2007) that his actions were on the basis that the Bank of England was the "lender of last resort" but subsequently supported moves to provide funding to those banks which had been nationalised or partly nationalised.
===Political interventions===
It has been alleged that King's Mansion House speech for 2009 helped to bolster the Conservatives during the approach to the general election by issuing high-profile criticisms. King called for the break-up of the country's biggest banks, as well as arguing that, unless the bank was given more active, interventionist powers to ensure financial stability, it would be like a church: able to "do no more than issue sermons or organise burials."<ref name="King speech394"/><ref name="Times 14.03.2012"/> King later advised a rebalancing of the economy, increased saving, and an "elimination of the structural deficit".<ref name="Guardian 21.10.2009"/> In November 2009, he told MPs that the then Labour government's intention of halving the deficit over the next five years was insufficient.<ref name="ft_9-11-11"></ref> In May 2010, just days after the Coalition government was formed,<ref name="ft_14-05-11"></ref> King said he had spoken to Chancellor George Osborne and supported his plans to cut spending by a further £6 billion within the 2010–11 fiscal year.<ref name="ft_9-11-11"/> The Liberal Democrats did not need to be talked around to agreeing to the severity of the cuts.<ref name="ft_blog1"></ref>
In November 2010, it was revealed that some senior staff at the Bank of England (one of them was David Blanchflower)<ref name="DaBl 18Apr2012" /> were uncomfortable with King's endorsement of the government's public spending cuts, accusing him of overstepping the boundary between monetary and fiscal policy. King's support for the government's cuts was in spite of concerns within the bank that cutting spending so rapidly could derail the UK's nascent economic-recovery.<ref name="ft_9-11-11" /> These revelations led to accusations of King being a "coalition courtier"<ref></ref> and of making "excessively political"<ref></ref> interventions with regard to UK economic policy.<ref name="ft_blog1" />
The accusations were given greater weight after the December 2010 WikiLeaks Cablegate.<ref></ref><ref></ref> As a result of the WikiLeaks disclosures and David Laws' account of the Tory-Lib-Dem coalition-talks, King was asked by the Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee to explain why he was seemingly cited in the talks as backing Tory plans to introduce spending cuts this year.<ref></ref> King insisted to the committee that "at no stage did I offer any advice on the composition of any measures designed to reduce the government deficit";<ref></ref> the committee implicitly accepted King's explanation of events as he is not even mentioned, let alone criticised, in their final report.<ref></ref>
According to George Osborne, Gus O'Donnell made an offer to have King brief the Tories and Lib Dems during the Coalition's formative talks; however, the parties suspected they "knew what he was going to say and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. also thought it was more appropriate for our Treasury spokesmen to talk to him".<ref> See Q20 and Q21 plus answers.</ref>
King was criticised again in May 2012 on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, on the day before an election, after he expressed approval of Coalition austerity measures.<ref></ref>
In a speech to the European Parliament in Brussels in May 2011, King commented that the Bank of England was more concerned with the broader stability of the economy and banking sector than with inflation figures: "The economic consequences of high-level indebtedness now would become more severe if rates were to rise. It is the main reason why interest rates are so low."<ref name="Tele 03.05.2011"></ref> With regard to George Osborne, King was critical of Chancellor Osborne's misleading figures, and correctly predicted in a "light plausibility check" that Merlin would be a failure.<ref></ref> In March 2009, King said any plan for a second fiscal stimulus by the UK Government had to be done with caution.<ref> urltoken BEO Governor: "No More Stimulus", optionarmageddon.ml-implode.com; accessed 30 March 2015.</ref>
In his Mansion House speech in June 2009, King criticised Chancellor Alistair Darling for resisting significant changes to the allocation of regulatory responsibilities between the FSA, the Treasury and the bank, which would have given the bank greater power to fulfil its role of ensuring economic stability.<ref>For King's previous position see </ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
In January 2012, King received a letter from the government's former chief scientific adviser Sir David King, Zac Goldsmith, former environment minister John Gummer (and 17 others) warning of the possibility of a carbon bubble.<ref name="Guardian 19.01.2012"></ref> King agreed to an evaluation of the matter.<ref name="CalLea 06Feb2012"></ref>
The BoE's Financial Policy Committee, established to identify emerging bubbles in the financial system, agreed in March 2012 to ask Parliament for new policy tools to be used to prevent another financial crisis. King said that the FPC narrowed its choice of instruments to three—the power to ensure banks have countercyclical capital buffers, the ability to force banks to hold more capital against exposure to specific sectors judged risky, and the power to set leverage ratios—because it will be important to explain to parliament and the wider public why it is or is not using them.<ref name="RBla 25Mar2012"></ref>
Late March 2019, he argued that the UK should leave without a deal in the wake of the UK's Brexit, arguing that the economic consequences would be limited, and that the UK was well-prepared after six months of preparations.<ref></ref>
