Daddy Day Care

==Plot==
Marketing executive Charlie Hinton and his best friend, Phil Ryerson, find themselves (along with 300 others) fired when their boss, CEO Jim Fields, shuts down the company's entire health division due to children disliking new, healthy breakfast cereals made from vegetables. While his wife Kim supports the family by returning to work as a lawyer, Charlie, after six weeks of job hunting, is forced to take their young son Ben out of Chapman Academy - an expensive and Hothousing preschool headed by the haughty Gwyneth Harridan. Unable to find a more affordable alternative, Charlie eventually decides to open his very own daycare center in his home with the help of Phil, calling it "Daddy Day Care". Although local parents are Gender role wanting to work with kids, a few opt to use their service due to it being cheaper and more child-based.
Charlie and Phil open their new daycare with a few children, but struggle on their first day due to the kids being prone to causing chaos around the house, and some having personal issues they struggle with. Angered at having competition from the men, Harridan attempts to shut them down by notifying child services of the new daycare. Charlie and Phil soon find themselves rectifying problems pointed out by Dan Kubitz, a director of child services, to ensure their daycare is suitable for children, including hiring their former colleague Marvin as an additional care provider. In time, the men slowly begin to enjoy running Daddy Day Care, which grows in popularity, and bonding with the kids, with Charlie delighted to see Ben enjoying himself. However, Harridan continues to attempt to shut them down after losing children to Daddy Day Care. When Kubitz reveals their house cannot accommodate the number of children they have, Charlie opts to find a new permanent space facility somewhere in the city for the daycare rather than remove a few of the kids to keep it operating.
Marvin quickly reveals that he knows of a building that has potential, but the men cannot afford it. The group decide on holding a fundraising children's festival called "Rock for Daddy Day Care", to raise the necessary capital. However, Harridan learns of the event and decides to sabotage it with help from her hesitant assistant Jennifer, causing Daddy Day Care to make no progress in funding. Upon learning that Jim is re-establishing his company's health division and offering Charlie and Phil their old jobs back at double their salaries, and letting them run the whole health division, Harridan offers to take in their children for a cheaper price in exchange for Daddy Day Care shutting down. Charlie and Phil reluctantly accept the offer, leaving Marvin heartbroken and refusing to join them. The next day, at the marketing meeting for a cereal made from cotton candy, Charlie soon questions his decision, after he realizes the impact Daddy Day Care has had on Ben and the other children, and swiftly quits his job after refusing to support a marketing campaign for another cereal, leaving Jim and his executives dismayed by reception.
Convincing Phil to quit and re-open Daddy Day Care, and informing Marvin of their plans, Charlie confronts Harridan during a student orientation with the daycare's children, and reveals to the parents in attendance how little she cares about their children. Realising how much Daddy Day Care changed and helped their children, the parents decide to let them be taken back by Daddy Day Care. Six months later, the daycare manages to purchase the building it needs to expand, and prospers, with Charlie and Phil becoming a success, Jennifer now working for the center, and Marvin entering a relationship with one of the children's mothers. Phil helps a kid trying to get his toy truck before he accidentally falls on Bruce and smothers him, much to Charlie's amusement. With Chapman forced out of business, Harridan is forced to work as a crossing guard, and inadvertently causes a traffic jam when a flower she receives from one of her former children Crispin causes her to be swarmed by bees.
