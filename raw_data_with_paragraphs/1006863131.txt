In 1996, Earle formed his own record label, E-Squared Records, and released the album, I Feel Alright, which combined the musical sounds of country, rock and rockabilly.<ref name="CMT"/> Earle released the album El Corazon (The Heart) in 1997 which one reviewer called "the capstone of this Earle's remarkable comeback".<ref>Warren, Doug (November 20, 2007) "Steve Earle: El Corozon E-Squared/Warner Bros".

==Political views and activism==
Earle is outspoken with his political views, and often addresses them in his lyrics and in interviews. Politically he identifies as a Socialism, but tends to vote for Democratic candidates, despite not agreeing entirely with their politics.<ref></ref><ref></ref> During the 2016 election, he expressed support for Senator Bernie Sanders, whom he considered to have pushed Hillary Clinton to the left on important issues.<ref></ref> In a 2017 interview Earle stated about President Donald Trump: "We’ve never had an orangutan in the White House before. There’s a lot of “What does this button do?” going on. It’s scary. He really is a fascist. Whether he intended to be or not, he’s a real live fascist."<ref name="Betts"></ref> However, Earle has called for the American left to engage with the concerns of working class Trump voters, saying in 2017: "…maybe that’s one of the things we need to examine from my side because we’re responsible. The left has lost touch with American people, and it’s time to discuss that".<ref name="Toto"></ref> In 2020, he stated: "I thought that, given the way things are now, it was maybe my responsibility to make a record that spoke to and for people who didn’t vote the way that I did. One of the dangers that we’re in is if people like me keep thinking that everyone who voted for Trump is a racist or an asshole, then we’re fucked, because it’s simply not true."<ref name="Toto"></ref> 
In his 1990 song Justice in Ontario, Earle criticized the conviction of six Satan's Choice bikers for a 1978 murder in Port Hope, arguing that the accused were innocent, framed by the ruthless Corporal Terry Hall of the Ontario Provincial Police's Special Squad.<ref name="Newton"></ref> In the song, Earle compared the conviction of the "Port Hope 6" to the massacre of the Black Donnellys in 1880. In 1990, Earle stated in an interview about Justice In Ontario: "There’s some concern about reprisals because the O.P.P. (Ontario Provincial Police) is obviously not gonna be thrilled. My hope is that I’ll be far too out-in-the-open and far too public for the police to do anything and get away with it. But the point is, that’s not a reason for doing or not doing anything, because…I very nearly went to prison myself for something I didn’t do, simply because a law enforcement agency didn’t want to admit that somebody had fucked up—they didn’t want to open the whole can of worms and all the other complaints that were constantly brought against the Dallas police department. You can’t stand by and let stuff like that go down without saying anything about it. And I think I especially have a responsibility to do that, ’cause if I didn’t have any money right now I’d be in prison in Texas—I’m convinced of that. It was that close. But I was able to afford decent legal representation. And it comes down to the fact that people who can’t afford decent legal representation—who are subject to something like this happening and turning out very badly—feed my kids. That’s where my money comes from and that’s where my freedom comes from".<ref name="Newton"></ref>
Earle is a vocal opponent of capital punishment,<ref name="CMT"/> which he considers his primary area of political activism. Several of his songs have provided descriptions of the experiences of death row inmates, including Billy Austin and Over Yonder (Jonathan's Song).<ref name=NPR/> Conversely, he has also written a song from the perspective of a prison guard working on death row in Ellis Unit One, a song written for the film Dead Man Walking, the title based on the name of the Ellis Unit One.<ref> urltoken "Dead Man Walking" Ambles Away With Year's Top Singles Los Angeles Times. December 28, 1996.</ref> He is pro-choice, and has argued that rich Americans have always had access to abortions, and that the political issue in the US is really whether poor women should have access. His 2012 novel I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive describes the life of a morphine-addicted doctor in 1963 San Antonio before Roe v. Wade who treats gunshot wounds and provides illegal abortions to poor women.<ref></ref> Since his youngest son was diagnosed with autism, Earle has also become an advocate for people on the spectrum.
