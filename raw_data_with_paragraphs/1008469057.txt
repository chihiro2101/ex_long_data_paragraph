Jacques Necker

==Early life==
Necker was born in Geneva in a Calvinist household. In 1747 Jacques became a clerk in the bank of Thellusson and Vernet. In 1750 he was sent to Paris and worked for the bank Girardot. Soon after he managed to learn Dutch and English. On one day, he replaced the first clerk in charge of trading on the stock exchange and through a sequence of trades, he made a quick profit of half a million.<ref>Brewster, David. The Edinburgh Encyclopædia, urltoken p. 316</ref> In 1762, Vernet retired and Necker became a partner in the bank with Peter Thellusson who managed the bank in London, while Necker served as his managing partner in Paris. In 1763, before the end of the Seven Years' War, he successfully speculated in British debentures or bonds, wheat, and possibly Canadian shares, which he sold at a good profit in the next few years.<ref>Zeitgenossen.

Necker had fallen in love with Madame de Verménou, the widow of a French officer. When she went to see Théodore Tronchin, she became acquainted with Suzanne Curchod. In 1764, Madame de Verménou brought Suzanne to Paris as a companion for Thelusson's children. Suzanne was engaged to British writer Edward Gibbon, but he was forced to break the engagement. Necker transferred his love from the wealthy widow to the ambitious Swiss governess. They married before the end of the year. In 1766, they moved to Rue de Cléry and had a daughter, Anne Louise Germaine, later the famed author and salonnière Madame de Staël.
Madame Necker encouraged her husband to try to find himself a public position. He accordingly became a syndic (or director) of the French East India Company, around which a fierce political debate revolved in the 1760s between the company's directors and shareholders and the royal ministry over its administration and the company's autonomy.<ref>Lüthy, Herbert. urltoken Necker et la Compagnie des Indes</ref> "The ministry, concerned about the financial stability of the company, employed the Abbé Morellet to shift the debate from the rights of the shareholders to the advantages of commercial liberty over the company's privileged trading monopoly."<ref>Margerison, Kenneth.

From 1768 till 1776 he made loans to the French government in the form of Life annuity and by lottery operations.<ref>De Lapouge, Claude Vacher. Necker économiste, urltoken p.48</ref><ref>F. Aftalion, p. 23</ref> His wife made him give up his share in the bank, which he transferred to his brother Louis Necker and Jean Girardot in 1772. In 1773, Necker won the prize of the Académie Française for a defense of state corporatism framed as an eulogy in honor of Louis XIV's minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert. Necker was envied by his contemporaries for his fabulous wealth.<ref>Craiutu, Aurelian. urltoken A Voice of Moderation in the Age of Revolutions: Jacques Necker's Reflections on Executive Power in Modern Society</ref> His capital amounted to six or eight million livres, and he used Château de Madrid as a summer house. In 1775, in Essai sur la législation et le commerce des grains, he attacked the physiocracy, like Ferdinando Galiani, and questioned the laissez-faire policies of Turgot, the Controller-General of Finances. Turgot had made too many enemies; in May 1776, he was dismissed. But his successor, Clugny de Nuis, died in October.<ref>Durant, Will and Ariel (1967) Rousseau and Revolution, p. 865</ref><ref>F.

==Finance Minister of France==
On 29 June 1777, according to his daughter in her "Vie privée de Mr. Necker" he was made director-general of the royal treasury and not Controller-General of Finance which was impossible because of his Protestant faith.<ref> urltoken Neckers Charakter und Privatleben: nebst seinen nachgelassenen ., Band 1, p. 32</ref><ref>Simon Schama, Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution (New York: Random House, 1989), p. 94.</ref> Necker refused a salary, but he was not admitted to the Royal Council. He gained popularity through regulating the government's finances by attempting to divide the taille and the Tax per head more equally, abolishing a tax known as the vingtième d'industrie, (a value-added tax) and establishing Mount of piety (pawnshop-like establishments for loaning money on security). Necker tried through careful reforms (abolition of pensions, mortmain, droit de suite and more fair taxation) to rehabilitate the disorganized state budget. He abolished over five hundred sinecures and superfluous posts.<ref>Will and Ariel Durant (1967) Rousseau and Revolution, p. 866-867</ref> Together with his wife, he visited and improved life in hospitals and prisons. In April 1778 he remitted 2.4 million livres from his own fortune to the royal treasury.<ref> urltoken Othénin d’Haussonville (2004) "La liquidation du ‘dépôt’ de Necker: entre concept et idée-force,", p. 154-155 Cahiers staëliens, 55</ref><ref>Sur l’administration de M. Necker, p. 365</ref> Unlike Turgot - in his Mémoire sur les municipalités - Necker tried to install provincial assemblies and hoped they could serve as an effective means of reforming the Ancien régime. Necker succeeded only in Berry and Guyenne installing assemblies with an equal number of members from the Third estate.
His greatest financial measures were his use of loans to help fund the French debt and his use of high interest rates rather than raising taxes.<ref>Donald F. Swanson and Andrew P.

By 1781, France was suffering financially, and as director-general of the royal treasury he was blamed for the rather high debt accrued from the American Revolution.<ref>George Taylor, review of Jacques Necker: Reform Statesman of the Ancien Regime, by Robert D.

After Necker had shown Louis XVI his annual report, the king tried to keep its contents secret. Necker met the challenge aggressively by asking the King to bring him into the royal council. In revenge, Necker made the Compte rendu public; in no time between 200,000 copies were sold.<ref> urltoken The Edinburgh Encyclopædia; Conducted by David Brewster, p. 316</ref> It was rapidly translated into Dutch, German, Danish, Italian and English.
In his most influential work, which brought him instant fame, Necker summarized governmental income and expenditures to provide the first record of royal finances ever made public. The Account was meant to be an educational piece for the people, and in it, he expressed his desire to create a well-informed, interested populace.<ref>Schama, Citizens, 95.</ref> Before, the people had never considered governmental income and expenditure to be their concern, but the Compte rendu made them more proactive.
Maurepas became jealous and Vergennes called him a revolutionist. Necker declared that he would resign unless given the full title and authority of a minister, with a seat on the Conseil du Roi. Both Maurepas and Vergennes replied that they would resign if this was done.<ref>S.

The family returned to the Paris region, supposing they were present at the wedding of their only daughter Germaine in January 1786. The impending national bankruptcy of France caused Calonne to convene an Assembly of notables under the elimination of parlements in order to enforce tax reforms. It had not met since 1626. One could not issue new loans without the Parlements' approval.<ref>The French Revolution: An Economic Interpretation by Florin Aftalion, p. 25</ref> In his speech Calonne expressed doubts about Necker's statistics in the Compte rendu.

On 25 or 26 August Necker was called back to office accompanied by fireworks. According to John Hardman Marie-Antoinette helped to organise Necker's return to power.

Necker was appointed as Chief minister of France. He revoked the order of 16 August requiring bondholders to accept paper instead of money; government bonds rose 30% on the market. On 7 September Necker forbade the export of grain.<ref>Will and Ariel Durant (1967) Rousseau and Revolution, p. 949</ref> The bankers advanced the treasury sufficient funds to forestall a crisis over the next year.

==The one non-noble minister==
Necker succeeded in doubling the representation of the Third Estate to satisfy the nation's people. The Third Estate had as many deputies as the other two orders together. His address at the Estates-General on 5 May 1789 about the fundamental problems as financial health, constitutional monarchy, and institutional and political reforms lasted three hours. Necker suffered from a cold and after fifteen minutes he asked the secretary of the Agricultural Society to read the remainder.<ref> urltoken Wikisource</ref> He invited the representatives to leave aside their factional interests and take into consideration the general, long-term interests of the nation.

On 17 June 1789, the first act of the new National Assembly (French Revolution) declared all existing taxes illegal.

On 11 July, Necker received a note from the king enjoining him to leave the country within a day. He finished dining very calmly, without communicating the purport of the order he had received.

===Assignats===
Necker proved to be powerless as tax-revenue dropped quickly.

Necker held the finance post between 1777 and 1781 and "is remembered today for taking the unprecedented step in 1781 of making public the country’s budget, a novelty in an absolute monarchy where the state of finances had always been kept a secret."<ref name="stael"> urltoken Stael and the French Revolution Introduction by Aurelian Craiutu</ref> Necker was dismissed within a few months. By 1788 the inexorable compounding of interest on the national debt brought France to a fiscal crisis.<ref> urltoken Macroeconomic Features of the French Revolution, by T.J. Sargent & F.R. Velde, p. 481</ref> Necker was recalled to royal service. When he was dismissed on 11 July 1789, it was a factor in causing the Storming of the Bastille. Within two days Necker was recalled by the king and the assembly. Necker entered France in triumph and tried to accelerate the tax reform process. Faced with the opposition of the Constituent Assembly he resigned in September 1790 to a reaction of general indifference.
