Lyme Park

===Lyme Caxton Missal===
This missal had been owned by the Legh family since at least 1508. It is the only known nearly complete copy of the earliest edition of a missal according to the Sarum Rite still in existence. When the family moved from the house in 1946, the missal went with them, and was held for safe-keeping in the John Rylands Library in Manchester. In the late 2000s the National Trust acquired it, and it was decided to return it to Lyme Park. To celebrate this the d√©cor of the library was restored to the way it had been during the 19th&nbsp;century. This included re-graining of its ceiling, reproducing velvet for the upholstery and curtains, and re-papering the room with replica wallpaper, based on its original design.<ref></ref>
== Grounds ==
The house is surrounded by formal gardens of in a deer park of about which are listed at Grade&nbsp;II* in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.<ref name=ukb></ref><ref></ref> In the gardens and deer park are a number of structures.
===Gardens===

To the west of the house is the former mill pond. From the south side a lawn slopes down to another pond beyond which is a small ravine with a stone bridge, this area being known as Killtime. To the west of the lawn is the sunken Dutch Garden, which was created by William Legh. It consists of formal flower beds with a central fountain. To the west, south and east of the orangery are further formal flower gardens, including rose gardens.
===Deer park===
The park was enclosed in the 14th&nbsp;century by Piers Legh&nbsp;I. In the 17th&nbsp;century Richard Legh planted avenues of sycamore and lime trees. Richard's son, Peter Legh&nbsp;XII carried out more extensive tree-planting in the park, giving it its current appearance. Red deer descended from the original deer present when the park was enclosed graze in the grounds, as do Highland cattle. Formerly an unusual breed of wild white cattle with red ears grazed in the park but they became extinct in 1884.<ref name=micro></ref> 
Sheep also graze in the park. The Gritstone Trail and the Peak District Boundary Walk long-distance footpaths both cross the park.<ref name="osmap"></ref><ref name=":0"></ref>
===Structures===

The most obvious structure in the park, other than the house, is a tower called the Cage which stands on a hill to the east of the approach road to the house . It was originally a hunting lodge and was later used as a park-keeper's cottage and as a lock-up for prisoners. The first structure on the site was built about 1580; this was taken down and rebuilt in 1737, possibly to a design by Leoni for Peter Legh&nbsp;X. The tower is built in buff sandstone rubble with ashlar sandstone dressings. It is square in plan, in three storeys, with attached small square towers surmounted by cupolas at the corners. The Cage is a Grade&nbsp;II* listed building.<ref></ref> Also in the park is the Paddock Cottage which was erected by Peter Legh&nbsp;IX and restored in the early 21st&nbsp;century. To the east of this are the remains of the Stag House . To the left of the house in Lantern Wood is a belvedere known as the Lantern . It is built in sandstone and has three storeys and a spire; the lowest storey is square in plan while the other storeys and the spire are octagonal. The top storey and spire date from about 1580 and originally formed a bellcote on the north gatehouse. This was removed during the restoration of the house by Wyatt and rebuilt on the present site. It is a Grade&nbsp;II* listed building.<ref></ref>
Immediately to the northeast of the house is the Orangery which was designed in 1862 by Alfred Darbyshire. The Orangery is joined to the house by a covered passage known as the Dark Passage. This was designed by Wyatt for Sir&nbsp;Thomas Legh in 1815 and is a Grade&nbsp;II listed building.<ref></ref> Further from the house, to the northeast of the orangery, are the stables . These are dated 1863 and were also designed by Darbyshire. They are built in sandstone on a courtyard plan and are listed at Grade&nbsp;II.<ref></ref> Other structures in the grounds listed at Grade&nbsp;II are the Pheasant House dating from about 1870,<ref></ref> an Italian white marble Puteal in the centre of the courtyard of the house dating from the 18th&nbsp;century and probably brought to the house from Venice in about 1900,<ref></ref> sandstone kennels in an H-plan dating from around 1870,<ref></ref> a pair of gardener's cottages dated 1871,<ref></ref> terrace revetment walls to the west of the house containing some 17th-century masonry with later repairs,<ref></ref> the lodge, gate piers and gates on Lyme Park Drive,<ref></ref> the forward gatepiers to Lyme Park Drive, dating from the late 17th&nbsp;century and moved to their present position about 1860,<ref></ref> the gate piers in Red Lane,<ref></ref> and the gate piers, gates and railings to the north of the north front of the house.<ref></ref>
==Preservation ==
Lyme Park is owned and administered by the National Trust. The house, garden and park are open to the public at advertised hours.<ref name=nt></ref> An entrance fee to the house and garden is payable by non-members of the National Trust, and additional fee is charged for parking.<ref></ref> In the grounds are shops, a refreshment kiosk, a coffee shop and a restaurant.<ref></ref> The Lyme Caxton Missal is on display in the library. Associated with it is an interactive audio-visual display with a touch-screen facility to enable pages of the book to be "turned", and chants from the missal to be sung as they would have been 500&nbsp;years ago.<ref></ref> Events are held in the park.<ref></ref> The Bowmen of Lyme use the park for archery.<ref></ref>
Lyme Park and its hall have been used in several films and television programmes. The exterior of the hall was used as Pemberley, the seat of Mr Darcy, in the 1995 BBC adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, and as a location for the Red Dwarf episode "Timeslides".<ref></ref> It was also used as a location in the 2011 film The Awakening<ref></ref> and in the second series of The Village in 2014.<ref></ref>
In August 2019, the park was hit by severe flooding and was evacuated. Though staff attempted to rescue antiques and collectables, a large section of the garden was washed away.<ref></ref>
