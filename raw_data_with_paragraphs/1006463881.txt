Cowpunk

==Etymology and terminology==
The term "cowpunk" is first attested in 1979, as a blend of "cowboy" and "punk".<ref name="Crystal, David 2014, p. 228">Crystal, David. Words in Time and Place: Exploring Language Through the Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary. OUP Oxford, 2014, p. 228</ref> The term "country punk" has been proposed as an equivalent term.<ref name="Loudermilk"></ref> Both terms are sometimes used with a dash, especially in late 1970s or early 1980s sources (e.g., cow-punk or country-punk).
A 1984 New York Times article on the emerging aesthetic acknowledged "cowpunk" as one of several catch-all terms critics were using to categorize the country-influenced music of otherwise unrelated punk and new wave bands. The article briefly summarized the music's history, at least in the United States, saying that in the early 1980s, several punk and new wave bands had begun collecting classic country records, and soon thereafter began performing high-tempo cover versions of their favorite songs, and that new bands had also formed around the idea. By 1984, there were dozens of bands in both the U.S. and England "personalizing country music and making it palatable for the MTV Generation."
A New York Times writer stated that one issue with the "cowpunk" term was that ".no single term really describes the music of all these bands."<ref name="Crystal, David 2014, p. 228"/> Another author called the term "cowpunk" a critic-coined "misnomer" in 1985.<ref>Robbins, Ira A. The Rolling Stone Review 1985. Scribner's, 1985.</ref> A 2018 article looking back at the 1980s trends states that the ".diversity of styles beyond punk proper" in cowpunk, ".for some, made the category.suspect, or at least misleading."<ref name="Loudermilk"/>
==History==
===Precursors===
The first cowpunk bands in the late 1970s ".were inspired not by mainstream country but classic country, a more authentic-sounding music but also historically distant enough to be non-mainstream by default." <ref name="Loudermilk"/> There were precedents for blending country and related genres with rock or other styles. For example, all through the 1970s, country rock and southern rock were popular. However, by the early 1980s, the outlaw country trend had "worn out its welcome".<ref>McLeese, Don. Dwight Yoakam: A Thousand Miles from Nowhere. University of Texas Press, Mar. 7, 2012. p. 63</ref> Another factor that made country music unappealing to many youth in the early 1980s was that it was perceived as being on the "wrong side" in the "culture war", as country music was associated with conservative political values and highly-produced pop music.<ref name="McLeese, Don 2012. p. 63-64">McLeese, Don. Dwight Yoakam: A Thousand Miles from Nowhere. University of Texas Press, Mar. 7, 2012. p. 63-64</ref>
Don McLeese said the ways that youth associated country music 
made them not realize that it had youthful, exuberant "Hillbilly music" roots in earlier eras.<ref name="McLeese, Don 2012. p. 63-64"/> Joey Camp says he was turned off country as a teen in the early 1980s because he mistakenly thought that the ".countrypolitan fare" then popular on commercial radio, such as “Islands in the Stream” by "Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton, “Queen of Hearts” by Juice Newton, and “Always On My Mind” by Willie Nelson" was the extent of country music.<ref></ref>
Music writer Peter Doggett has stated that there has been a “difficult relationship between punk and country” since musicians from the two genres first encountered each other, but they did manage to meet and blend their styles.<ref name="ReferenceA">King, Ian. Appetite for Definition: An A-Z Guide to Rock Genres. HarperCollins, 2018</ref> As well, some new wave bands "displayed blatant country influences".<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
Early cowpunk bands were more appealing to alternative, non-mainstream youth from the 1980s, as some cowpunk bands explored "queer" themes in their lyrics, or identified or appeared in an androgynous manner.<ref name="Loudermilk"/> By the early 1980s, punk audiences did come to appreciate a blend of punk and rockabilly, when the new subgenre of psychobilly emerged, with bands such as The Cramps.
===1970s===
In 1978, Rosie Flores led Rosie and the Screamers, a band that one author calls a "cow-punk" group.<ref>Carlin, Richard.

After The Nervebreakers, influenced by The Cramps and Gun Club T. Tex started a new group, Tex & The Saddletramps.
===1980s===
In the early 1980s, punk groups such as L.A. band X, ".began to lean toward the twangy side, providing a subgenre that became known as cowpunk".<ref></ref> The L.A. cowpunk bands like X tended to be as intentionally sloppy, against "slick" production values, and anti-commercial as the punk genre they had "morphed" from, often from "blitzkrieg bands" (for example, The Dils became cowpunk band Rank and File).<ref>McLeese, Don. Dwight Yoakam: A Thousand Miles from Nowhere. University of Texas Press, Mar. 7, 2012. p. 59</ref> In the 1980s, Rosie Flores left the Screamers and joined a cowpunk all-female band called Screamin' Sirens.<ref>Gary Indiana, "Screamin' Sirens," Flipside, whole no. 49 (Summer 1986), pp. 18–19.</ref>

The Del-Lords formed in New York City in 1982,<ref name="time86">Cocks, Jay; L., Elizabeth. urltoken Music: Where the Lifeline Is. Time. August 4, 1986. Retrieved November 9, 2010</ref> founded by The Dictators' guitarist Scott Kempner. The band's cowpunk sound combined elements of 1960s garage rock with country, blues and folk influences. They were one of the early originators of urban roots-rock. The band members were Scott Kempner, Manny Caiati, Eric Ambel and Frank Funaro.
Nine Pound Hammer is an American hardcore-cowpunk band formed in 1985 by vocalist Scott Luallen and guitarist Blaine Cartwright in their hometown of Owensboro, Kentucky. They were one of the first rural hardcore punk bands to incorporate rural blue collar motifs into the hardcore sound. Their lyrics (suggestive of outlaw country) featured themes such as alcoholism, rural poverty, and violence. In contrast, most of the urban, experimental cowpunk bands of 1970s/80s Los Angeles and the UK were roots rock, folk rock or New Wave bands, and they incorporated country music instruments and influences as a secondary (sometimes temporary) aspect of their sound.
In Social Distortion's album Prison Bound (1986–1988), the band makes a notable style change, exploring a country music flavor . This record marks the start of the band's entrance into a cowpunk style. Country legend Johnny Cash and a honky tonk style became more prominent influences and there are references to Cash.

James Lorimer & Company, 1990. p. 147</ref> In the late 1980s, Edmonton-based Jr. Gone Wild has been called a "crisp, cheerfully honest" example of ,".that “cowpunk” thing, sure — but really it’s just the sugary-yet-direct indie rock of its time, poppy and looking back more than a little at the Gram Parsons side of the Byrds."<ref></ref>
In 1987, the independent film Border Radio was associated with the cowpunk scene. The film, which is directed by Allison Anders, Dean Lent and Kurt Voss, is about two musicians and a roadie who haven't been paid who rob money from a club and one of whom flees to Mexico leaving his wife and daughter behind. It features music from the Flesh Eaters, Green on Red, John Doe, the Divine Horsemen, X, and the Blasters.
By the late 1980s, high-end firms tried to capitalize on the cowpunk trend by selling expensive country western-themed merchandise. In 1989, The Washington Post reported that ".the biggest trend, especially at NM Neimen-Marcus, is Madison Avenue cowpunk—costumes for trust-fund Cowboy Junkies ranging from hand-stenciled "Indian" deerskin jackets by Ralph Lauren for her ($2,200) to western-style yoke-front tuxedos ($1,975) that are the visual equivalent of a Lonesome Strangers song. There's a Busch commercial/"Young Riders" yellow duster in lambskin ($1,200) that quite outshines the honest canvas one from J. Peterman ($184)."<ref></ref>
