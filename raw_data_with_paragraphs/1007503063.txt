Shekel

==Name==
The word is based on the Semitic verbal root for "weighing" (Š-Q-L), cognate to the Akkadian or , a unit of weight equivalent to the Sumerian .<ref></ref> Use of the word was first attested in during the Akkadian Empire under the reign of Naram-Sin, and later in in the Code of Hammurabi. The Š-Q-L root is found in the Hebrew words for "to weigh" , "weight" and "consideration" . It is cognate to the Aramaic root T-Q-L and the Arabic root Θ-Q-L ثقل, in words such as (the weight), (heavy) or (unit of weight). The famous Belshazzar's feast in the Biblical Book of Daniel includes a cryptic use of the word in Aramaic: "". The word shekel came into the English language via the Hebrew Bible, where it is first used in the Book of Genesis.<ref>Genesis 23:15-16</ref>
==History==
The earliest shekels were a unit of weight, used as other units such as grams and troy ounces for trading before the advent of coins. The shekel was common among western Semitic peoples. Moabites, Edomites, and Phoenicians used the shekel, although proper coinage developed very late. Carthaginian coinage was based on the shekel and may have preceded its home town of Tyre in issuing proper coins.<ref name="brony"/>
Coins were used and may have been invented by the early Anatolian traders who stamped their marks to avoid weighing each time used. Herodotus states that the first coinage was issued by Croesus, King of Lydia, spreading to the golden Daric (worth 20 or shekel),<ref>.</ref> issued by the Persian Empire and the silver Athenian obol and drachma. Early coins were money stamped with an official seal to certify their weight. Silver ingots, some with markings were issued. Later authorities decided who designed coins.
As with many ancient units, the shekel had a variety of values depending on the era, government and region; weights between 7<ref name="dubya"/> and 17&nbsp;grams and values of 11,<ref>Tenney, Merril ed., The Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible, vol. 5, "Weights and Measures," Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1976.</ref> 14, and 17&nbsp;grams are common. A two-shekel weight recently recovered near the temple area in Jerusalem and dated to the period of the First Temple weighs 23 grams,<ref>Jonathan Laden, Iron Age Weight Found near Temple Mount, October 15, 2020. urltoken giving a weight of 11.5 grams per shekel in Israel during the monarchy. When used to pay laborers, recorded wages in the ancient world range widely. The Code of Hammurabi (circa 1800 BC) sets the value of unskilled labor at approximately ten shekels per year of work.<ref name="BotterweckRinggren2004"></ref> Later, records within the Persian Empire (539–333 BC) give ranges from a minimum of two shekels per month for unskilled labor, to as high as seven to ten shekels per month in some records.<ref name="Altmann20162"></ref> A survival wage for an urban household during the Persian period would require at least 22 shekels of income per year.<ref name="Altmann20162" />
===Israelites===
 notes that the measures of the ingredients for the holy anointing oil were to be calculated using the Shekel of the Sanctuary (see also , and similarly at for payment for the redemption of 273 first-born males<ref>See Bemidbar (parsha)#Sixth reading — Numbers 3:40–51</ref> and at for the offerings of the leaders of the tribes of Israel), suggesting that there were other common measures of shekel in use, or at least that the Temple authorities defined a standard for the shekel to be used for Temple purposes.
According to Jewish law, whenever a census of the Jewish people was to be conducted, every person that was counted was required to pay the half-Shekel for his atonement .<ref>Compare Josephus, Antiquities (vii. 13, § 1) urltoken 
The Aramaic , similar to the Hebrew , used in Belshazzar's feast during the Belshazzar according to the Book of Daniel and defined as weighed, shares a common root with the word shekel and may even additionally attest to its original usage as a weight.
===Second Temple period half-Shekel Temple tax===
During the Second Temple period, it was customary among Jews to annually offer the half-Shekel into the Temple treasury, for the upkeep and maintenance of the Temple precincts, as also used in purchasing public animal-offerings. This practice not only applied to Jews living in the Land of Israel, but also to Jews living outside the Land of Israel.<ref>Josephus, Antiquities (xviii. 9, § 1)</ref> Archaeological excavations conducted at Hurvat Itri in Israel from 1999 to 2001 by Boaz Zissu and Amir Ganor of the Israeli Antiquities Authority (IAA) have yielded important finds, the most-prized of which being a half-Shekel coin minted in the 2nd century CE, upon which are embossed the words "Half-Shekel" in paleo-Hebrew , and which same coin possesses a silver content of 6.87 grams.<ref>Boaz Zissu & Amir Ganor, Horvat Ethri — A Jewish Village from the Second Temple Period and the Bar Kokhba Revolt in the Judean Foothills, Journal of Jewish Studies 60 (1), Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies, London 2009, pp. 96; 118.</ref> According to the Jewish historian Josephus, the annual monetary tribute of the half-Shekel to the Temple at Jerusalem was equivalent to two didrachm, each Athenian or Attic drachma weighing a little over 4.3 grams.<ref>Josephus, Wars of the Jews (vii. 6, § 6).</ref>
===First and Second Jewish Revolt===
The Jerusalem shekel was issued from AD&nbsp;66 to 70 amid the First Jewish Revolt as a means of emphasizing the independence of Judaea from Roman rule.
The Bar Kochba shekel was issued from AD&nbsp;132 to 135 amid the Bar Kokhba Revolt for similar reasons.
===Carthage===
The Carthaginian or Punic shekel was typically around 7.2&nbsp;grams in silver and 7.5&nbsp;grams in gold (suggesting an exchange rate of 12:1).<ref name=dubya></ref> They were apparently first developed on Sicily during the mid-4th century BC.<ref name=brony>.</ref> They were particularly associated with the payment of Carthage's mercenary armies and were repeatedly debased over the course of each of the Punic Wars, although the Carthaginian Empire's expansion into Spain under the Barcids before the Second and recovery under Hannibal before the Third permitted improving the amount and quality of the currency. Throughout, it was more common for Carthage's holdings in North Africa to employ bronze or no coinage except when paying mercenary armies and for most of the coin to circulate in Spain, Sardinia, and Sicily.<ref name=dubya/>
===Tyre===
The Tyrian shekel began to be issued .<ref name=brony/> Owing to the relative purity of their silver, they were the preferred medium of payment for the Temple tax in Jerusalem despite their royal and pagan imagery. The money changers assaulted by Jesus in the New Testament are those who exchanged worshippers' baser common currency for such shekels and they have been suggested as a possible coin used as the "30 pieces of silver" in the New Testament.<ref>.</ref>

The Israeli shekel (properly replaced the Israeli lira in 1980. Its currency sign was , although it was more commonly denominated as ש or IS. It was subdivided into 100 new agora. It suffered from hyperinflation and was quickly replaced.
The new shekel replaced it in 1985. Its currency sign is

Shekel or sheqel (Phoenician: , , plural or shekels; šiqlu or siqlu) is an ancient Near Eastern coin, usually of silver. A shekel was first a unit of weight—very roughly —and became currency in ancient Tyre and Carthage and then in ancient Israel under the Maccabees.
