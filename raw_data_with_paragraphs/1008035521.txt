Extreme weather events of 535–536

== Documentary evidence ==
The Byzantine historian Procopius recorded in 536 in his report on the wars with the Vandals, "during this year a most dread portent took place. For the sun gave forth its light without brightness … and it seemed exceedingly like the sun in eclipse, for the beams it shed were not clear".<ref></ref><ref>, gives this quote as "The Sun gave forth its light without brightness, like the moon during this whole year, and it seemed exceedingly like the Sun in eclipse".</ref>
In 538, the Roman statesman Cassiodorus also stated that the light of the sun was weak and that crops had failed.<ref> See: "25. Senator, Praetorian Praefect, to his deputy Ambrosius, an Illustris."</ref>
The Teotihuacan culture during this time period seems to go into decline, with widespread rioting in the upper-class districts occurring in the following decades.
Michael the Syrian (1126–1199), a patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church, recorded that during 536–537 the sun shone feebly for a year and a half.<ref> From pp. 220–221: "Or, un peu auparavant, en l'an 848, il y eut un signe dans le soleil. … , et le vin avait le goût de celui qui provient de raisins acides." (However, a little earlier, in the year 848 according to the Greek calendar; 536/537 AD according to the Christian calendar, there was a sign in the sun. One had never seen it before and nowhere is it written that such an event had happened previously in the world. If it were not true that we found it recorded in most proven and credible writings, and confirmed by men worthy of belief, we would not have written it here; for it's difficult to conceive. So it is said that the sun was darkened, and that its eclipse lasted a year and a half, that is, eighteen months. Every day it shone for about four hours and yet this light was only a feeble shadow. Everyone declared that it would not return to the state of its original light. Fruits didn't ripen, and wine had the taste of what comes from sour grapes.)</ref>
The Gaelic Irish Annals<ref> urltoken Gaelic Irish Annals translations</ref><ref> urltoken Documents of Ireland</ref><ref> urltoken The Annals of the Four Masters</ref> recorded the following:
* "A failure of bread in the year 536 AD" – the Annals of Ulster
* "A failure of bread from the years 536–539 AD" – the Annals of Inisfallen
Further phenomena were reported by a number of independent contemporary sources:
* Low temperatures, even snow during the summer (snow reportedly fell in August in China, which caused the harvest there to be delayed)<ref name="Ochoa05_p71"></ref>
* Widespread crop failures<ref></ref>

== Scientific evidence ==
Tree ring analysis by dendrochronology Mike Baillie, of the Queen's University of Belfast, shows abnormally little growth in Irish oak in 536 and another sharp drop in 542, after a partial recovery.<ref>Baillie, M.G.L. (1994). "Dendrochronology Raises Questions About the Nature of the AD 536 Dust-Veil Event." The Holocene fig. 3 p. 215.</ref> Ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica show evidence of substantial sulfate deposits in around 534 ± 2, which is evidence of an extensive acidic dust veil.<ref name="Larsen" />
== Possible explanations ==
It has been conjectured that the changes were caused by ashes or dust thrown into the air after the eruption of a volcano (a phenomenon known as "volcanic winter"),<ref name="Wohletz">Wohletz, Ken, urltoken Were the Dark Ages Triggered by Volcano-Related Climate Changes in the 6th Century? </ref> or after the impact of a comet<ref></ref> or meteorite.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The evidence of sulfate deposits in ice cores strongly supports the volcano hypothesis; the sulfate spike is even more intense than that which accompanied the lesser episode of climatic aberration in 1816, popularly known as the "Year Without a Summer", which has been connected to the explosion of the volcano Mount Tambora in Sumbawa.<ref name="Larsen" />
In 1984, R. B. Stothers postulated that the event might have been caused by the volcano Rabaul in what is now New Britain, near Papua New Guinea.<ref></ref>
In 1999, David Keys suggested that the volcano Krakatoa exploded at the time and caused the changes.<ref name="Wohletz" /> It is suggested that an eruption of Krakatoa described as occurring in 416 by the Javanese Pararaton actually took place in 535–536, there being no other evidence of such an eruption in 416.<ref name="Keys, David Patrick 2000" />
In 2009, Dallas Abbott of Columbia University's Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory in New York published evidence from Greenland ice cores that multiple comet impacts caused the haze. The spherules found in the ice might originate from terrestrial debris ejected into the atmosphere by an impact event.<ref name="Abbott08" /><ref></ref>
In 2010, Robert Dull, John Southon, and colleagues presented evidence suggesting a link between the Tierra Blanca Joven (TBJ) eruption of the Lake Ilopango in central El Salvador and the 536 event.<ref></ref> Although earlier published radiocarbon evidence suggested a two-sigma age range of 408–536,<ref></ref> which is consistent with the global climate downturn, the connection between 536 and Ilopango was not explicitly made until research on Central American Pacific margin marine sediment cores by Steffen Kutterolf and colleagues showed that the phreatoplinian TBJ eruption was much larger than previously thought.<ref></ref> The radiocarbon dating in successive growth increments of a single tree that had been killed by a TBJ pyroclastic flow was measured in detail using accelerator mass spectrometry; the results supported the date of 535 as the year in which the tree died. A conservative bulk tephra volume for the TBJ event of ~84&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> was calculated, indicating a large Volcanic Explosivity Index 6+ event and a magnitude of 6.9. The results suggested that the Ilopango TBJ eruption size, latitude, and age are consistent with the ice core sulphate records of Larsen et al. 2008. However, a more recent study, examining other evidence, now dates the eruption to the year 431 C.E.<ref></ref>
A 2015 study further supported the theory of a major eruption in "535 or early 536", with North American volcanoes considered a likely candidate. It also identified signals of a second eruption in 539–540, likely to have been in the tropics, which would have sustained the cooling effects of the first eruption through to around 550.<ref>. urltoken Archived copy</ref>
In 2018, Harvard University researchers suggested the cause was a volcanic eruption in Iceland that erupted in early 536. However, the author of the previous study said to Science magazine that the evidence is insufficient to discard the North America hypothesis.<ref name="Gibbons18" />
== Historic consequences ==
The 536 event and ensuing famine have been suggested as an explanation for the deposition of hoards of gold by Scandinavian elites at the end of the Migration Period. The gold was possibly a sacrifice to appease the gods and get the sunlight back.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Mythological events such as the Fimbulwinter and Ragnarök are theorized to be based on the cultural memory of the event.<ref>Ström, Folke: Nordisk Hedendom, Studentlitteratur, Lund 2005, (first published 1961) among others, refer to the climate change theory.</ref>
The decline of Teotihuacán, a large city in Mesoamerica, is also associated with the droughts related to the climate changes, with signs of civil unrest and famines.
A book written by David Keys speculates that the climate changes contributed to various developments, such as the emergence of the Plague of Justinian (541–549 AD), the decline of the Avars, the migration of Mongolian tribes towards the West, the end of the Sassanid Empire, the collapse of the Gupta Empire, the rise of Islam, the expansion of Turkic tribes, and the fall of Teotihuacán.<ref name="Keys, David Patrick 2000" /> In 2000, a 3BM Television production (for WNET and Channel 4) capitalized upon Keys' book. The documentary, under the name Catastrophe! How the World Changed, was broadcast in the US as part of PBS's Secrets of the Dead series.<ref name="gunn2000"></ref>
However, Keys and Wohletz' ideas lack mainstream acceptance. Reviewing Keys' book, British archaeologist Ken Dark commented that "much of the apparent evidence presented in the book is highly debatable, based on poor sources or simply incorrect. . Nonetheless, both the global scope and the emphasis on the 6th century AD as a time of wide-ranging change are notable, and the book contains some obscure information which will be new to many. However, it fails to demonstrate its central thesis and does not offer a convincing explanation for the many changes discussed".<ref name="dark1999"></ref>
