Prospect theory

== Overview ==
The prospect theory starts with the concept of loss aversion, an asymmetric form of risk aversion, from the observation that people react differently between potential losses and potential gains. Thus, people make decisions based on the potential gain or losses relative to their specific situation (the reference point) rather than in absolute terms; this is referred to as reference dependence.
* Faced with a risky choice leading to gains, individuals are risk-averse, preferring solutions that lead to a lower expected utility but with a higher certainty (concave value function).
* Faced with a risky choice leading to losses, individuals are risk-seeking, preferring solutions that lead to a lower expected utility as long as it has the potential to avoid losses (convex value function).
These two examples are thus in contradiction with the expected utility theory, which only considers choices with the maximum utility. Note also that the concavity for gains and convexity for losses implies diminishing marginal utility with increasing gains/losses. In other words, someone who has more money has a lower desire for a fixed amount of gain (and lower aversion to a fixed amount of loss) than someone who has less money.
The theory continues with a second concept, based on the observation that people attribute excessive weight to events with low probabilities and insufficient weight to events with high probability. For example, individuals may unconsciously treat an outcome with a probability of 99% as if its probability was 95%, and an outcome with probability of 1% as if it had a probability of 5%. Under- and over-weighting of probabilities is importantly distinct from under- and over-estimating probabilities, a different type of cognitive bias observed for example in the overconfidence effect.
==Model==
The theory describes the decision processes in two stages:<ref>*</ref>
*During an initial phase termed editing, outcomes of a decision are ordered according to a certain heuristic. In particular, people decide which outcomes they consider equivalent, set a reference point and then consider lesser outcomes as losses and greater ones as gains. The editing phase aims to alleviate any framing effects. It also aims to resolve isolation effects stemming from individuals' propensity to often isolate consecutive probabilities instead of treating them together. The editing process can be viewed as composed of coding, combination, segregation, cancellation, simplification and detection of dominance.
*In the subsequent evaluation phase, people behave as if they would compute a value (utility), based on the potential outcomes and their respective probabilities, and then choose the alternative having a higher utility.
The formula that Kahneman and Tversky assume for the evaluation phase is (in its simplest form) given by:
:<math>V = \sum_
Probability distortion is that people generally do not look at the value of probability uniformly between 0 and 1. Lower probability is said to be over-weighted (that is a person is over concerned with the outcome of the probability) while medium to high probability is under-weighted (that is a person is not concerned enough with the outcome of the probability). The exact point in which probability goes from over-weighted to under-weighted is arbitrary, however a good point to consider is probability&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.33. A person values probability&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.01 much more than the value of probability&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 (probability&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.01 is said to be over-weighted). However, a person has about the same value for probability&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.4 and probability&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.5. Also, the value of probability&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.99 is much less than the value of probability&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, a sure thing (probability&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.99 is under-weighted). A little more in depth when looking at probability distortion is that π(p)&nbsp;+&nbsp;π(1&nbsp;−&nbsp;p)&nbsp;<&nbsp;1 (where π(p) is probability in prospect theory).
==Applications==
=== Economics ===
Some behaviors observed in economics, like the disposition effect or the reversing of risk aversion/risk seeking in case of gains or losses (termed the reflection effect), can also be explained by referring to the prospect theory.
An important implication of prospect theory is that the way economic agents subjectively frame an outcome or transaction in their mind affects the utility they expect or receive. Narrow framing is a derivative result which has been documented in experimental settings by Tversky and Kahneman,<ref></ref> whereby people evaluate new gambles in isolation, ignoring other relevant risks. This phenomenon can be seen in practice in the reaction of people to stock market fluctuations in comparison with other aspects of their overall wealth; people are more sensitive to spikes in the stock market as opposed to their labor income or the housing market.<ref></ref> It has also been shown that narrow framing causes loss aversion among stock market investors.<ref></ref> And their work, that of Tversky and Kahneman, is largely responsible for the advent of behavioral economics, and is used extensively in mental accounting.<ref>Pesendorfer, Wolfgang. 2006. "Behavioral Economics Comes of Age: A Review Essay on Advances in Behavioral Economics." Journal of Economic Literature, 44 (3): 712-721.</ref>
=== Software ===
The digital age has brought the implementation of prospect theory in software. Framing and prospect theory has been applied to a diverse range of situations which appear inconsistent with standard economic rationality: the equity premium puzzle, the excess returns puzzle and long swings/PPP puzzle of exchange rates through the endogenous prospect theory of Imperfect Knowledge Economics, the status quo bias, various gambling and betting puzzles, intertemporal consumption, and the endowment effect. It has also been argued that prospect theory can explain several empirical regularities observed in the context of auctions (such as secret reserve prices) which are difficult to reconcile with standard economic theory.<ref></ref>
=== Politics ===
Given the necessary degree of uncertainty for which prospect theory is applied, it should came as no surprise that it and other Psychology models are applied extensively in the context of political decision-making.<ref name=":0"></ref> Both rational choice and Game theory models generate significant predictive power in the analysis of international relations (IR). But prospect theory, unlike the alternative models, (1) is "founded on empirical data", (2) allows and accounts for dynamic change, (3) addresses previously-ignored modular elements, (4) emphasizes the situation in the decision-making process, (5) "provides a micro-foundational basis for the explanation of larger phenomena", and (6) stresses the importance of loss in utility and value calculations.<ref name=":1"></ref> Moreover, again unlike other models, prospect theory "asks different sorts of questions, seeks different evidence, and reaches different conclusions."<ref name=":1" /> However, there exist shortcomings inherent in prospect theory's political application, such as the dilemma regarding an actor's perceived position on the gain-loss domain spectrum, and the discordance between ideological and pragmatic (i.e. 'in the lab' versus 'in the field') assessments of an actor's propensity toward seeking or avoiding risk.<ref name=":2"></ref>
That said, prospect theory is still used and foremost employed by IR theorists today, on predominantly security-related matters.<ref name=":2" /> For example, in war-time, policy-makers, when in a perceived domain of loss, are more likely to take risks that would otherwise have been avoided, e.g. "gambling on a risky rescue mission", or implementing radical domestic reform to support military efforts.<ref name=":2" /> Or, with regards to domestic governance, politicians are more likely to phrase a radical economic policy as one ensuring 90% employment rather than 10% unemployment, because framing it as the former puts the citizenry in a "domain of gain," which is thereby conducive to greater populace satisfaction.<ref name=":2" /> On a broader scale: Consider an administration debating the implementation of a controversial reform, and that such a reform yields a small chance for a widespread revolt. "The disutility induced by loss aversion," even with minute probabilities of said insurrection, will dissuade the government from moving forward with the reform.<ref name=":0" />
==Limits and extensions==
The original version of prospect theory gave rise to violations of first-order stochastic dominance. That is, prospect A might be preferred to prospect B even if the probability of receiving a value x or greater is at least as high under prospect B as it is under prospect A for all values of x, and is greater for some value of x. Later theoretical improvements overcame this problem, but at the cost of introducing intransitivity in preferences. A revised version, called cumulative prospect theory overcame this problem by using a probability weighting function derived from rank-dependent expected utility theory. Cumulative prospect theory can also be used for infinitely many or even continuous outcomes (for example, if the outcome can be any real number). An alternative solution to overcome these problems within the framework of (classical) prospect theory has been suggested as well.<ref>Rieger, M. & Wang, M. (2008). Prospect Theory for continuous distributions. Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, 36, 1, 83–102.</ref>
Critics from the field of psychology argued that even if Prospect Theory arose as a descriptive model, it offers no psychological explanations for the processes stated in it.<ref>Staddon, John (2017) Scientific Method: How science works, fails to work or pretends to work. Taylor and Francis.</ref>
Furthermore, factors that are equally important to decision making processes have not been included in the model, such as emotion.<ref></ref>
A relatively simple ad hoc decision strategy, the priority heuristic, has been suggested as an alternative model. While it can predict the majority choice in all (one-stage) gambles in Kahneman and Tversky (1979), and predicts the majority choice better than cumulative prospect theory across four different data sets with a total of 260 problems,<ref>Brandstätter, E., Gigerenzer, G., & Hertwig, R. (2006). The priority heuristic: Making choices without trade-offs. Psychological Review, 113, 409–432.</ref> this heuristic, however, fails to predict many simple decision situations that are typically not tested in experiments and it also does not explain heterogeneity between subjects.<ref>Rieger, M. & Wang, M. (2008). What is behind the Priority Heuristic? – A mathematical analysis and comment on Brandstätter, Gigerenzer and Hertwig. Psychological Review, 115, 1, 274–280.</ref>
An international survey in 53 countries, published in Theory and Decision in 2017, confirmed that prospect theory describes decisions on lotteries well, not only in Western countries, but across many different cultures.<ref>Rieger, M. O., Wang, M., & Hens, T. (2017). Estimating cumulative prospect theory parameters from an international survey. Theory and Decision, 82(4), 567-596.</ref> The study also found cultural and economic factors influencing systematically average prospect theory parameters.
A study published in Nature Human Behaviour in 2020 replicated research on prospect theory and concluded that it successfully replicated: "We conclude that the empirical foundations for prospect theory replicate beyond any reasonable thresholds."<ref></ref>

Prospect theory is a theory of the psychology of choice and finds application in behavioral economics and behavioral finance. It was developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979.<ref></ref> The theory was cited in the decision to award Kahneman the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics.<ref></ref> 
Based on results from controlled studies, it describes how individuals assess their loss and gain perspectives in an asymmetric manner (see loss aversion). For example, for some individuals, the pain from losing $1,000 could only be compensated by the pleasure of earning $2,000. Thus, contrary to the expected utility theory (which models the decision that perfectly Rational actors would make), prospect theory aims to describe the actual behavior of people.
In the original formulation of the theory, the term prospect referred to the predictable results of a lottery. However, prospect theory can also be applied to the prediction of other forms of behaviors and decisions.
