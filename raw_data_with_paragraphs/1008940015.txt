Jake and Dinos Chapman

==Lives and careers==
Jake Chapman was born in Cheltenham and Dinos Chapman in London. Their father was an English art teacher and their mother an orthodox Greek Cypriot (hence "Jake" an anglicised diminutive of the orthodox Iakovos, and "Dinos", a typical diminutive of the orthodox Konstantinos). They were brought up in Cheltenham but moved to Hastings where they attended a local comprehensive (William Parker School). Dinos studied at the Ravensbourne (college) (1980–83), Jake at the University of East London<ref name="UEL Alumni - Arts Showcase">,</ref> (1985–88) before both together enrolled at the Royal College of Art (1988–90), when they also worked as assistants to the artists Gilbert and George.<ref>End game.

===Art collaboration===
They began their own collaboration in 1991. The brothers have often made pieces with plastic models or fibreglass mannequins of people. An early piece consisted of eighty-three scenes of torture and disfigurement derivative of those recorded by Francisco Goya in his series of etchings, The Disasters of War (a work they later returned to) rendered into small three-dimensional plastic models. One of these was later turned into a life-size work, Great Deeds Against the Dead, shown along with Zygotic Acceleration, Biogenetic, De-Sublimated Libidinal Model (Enlarged x 1000) at the Sensation exhibition in 1997.
The Chapman brothers continued the theme of anatomical and pornographic grotesque with Fuck Face, a series of mannequins of children, sometimes fused together, with genitalia in place of facial features. Their sculpture Hell (2000) consisted of a large number of Figurines of Nazis arranged in nine glass cases laid out in the shape of a swastika. In 2003, with a series of works named Insult to Injury, they altered a set of Goya's etchings by adding funny faces. As a protest against this piece, Aaron Barschak (who later gate-crashed Prince William's 21st birthday party dressed as Osama bin Laden in a frock) threw a pot of red paint over Jake Chapman during a talk he was giving in May 2003. The Chapmans' oeuvre has also referenced work by William Blake, Auguste Rodin and Nicolas Poussin. Jake Chapman has published a number of catalogue essays and pieces of art criticism in his own right, as well as a book, Meatphysics (Creation Books, 2003). The brothers have also designed a label for Becks beer as part of a series of limited edition labels produced by contemporary artists. Using a title from the Tim Burton film, in 2004 they curated A Nightmare Before Christmas as part of the occasional All Tomorrow's Parties music festival at Camber Sands. In October 2013 the Chapman brothers took part in Art Wars at the Saatchi Gallery curated by Ben Moore. The artists were issued with a stormtrooper helmet, which they transformed into a work of art. Proceeds went to the Missing Tom Fund set up by Moore to find his brother Tom who has been missing for over ten years. The work was also shown on the Regents Park platform as part of Art Below Regents Park.
===The Rape of Creativity===
From April–June 2003, the Chapmans held a solo show at Modern Art Oxford entitled The Rape of Creativity in which "the enfants terribles of Britart, bought a mint collection of Francisco Goya's most celebrated prints – and set about systematically defacing them".<ref name=jones>Jones, Jonathan. urltoken Look What We Did, The Guardian, 31 March 2003.

Retrieved 3 February 2009.</ref> they also noted that the effect of their work was powerful.<ref name=telegraph/>
The Chapman brothers were nominated for the Turner Prize in 2003. As well as including Insult to Injury, their Turner Prize exhibit debuted two new works Sex and Death. Sex directly referenced their previous work Great Deeds against the Dead. The original work shows three dismembered corpses hanging from a tree, Sex shows the same scenario, but in a heightened state of decay. Additionally clown's noses are now present on the skulls of the corpses; snakes, rats and insects (like those found in joke shops) cover the piece. Death is two sex dolls, placed on top of each other, head-to-toe in the 69 sex position: despite appearing to be made of plastic it is in fact cast in bronze and painted to look like plastic. That year the prize was eventually won by Grayson Perry.
On 24 May 2004, a Momart destroyed many works from the Saatchi collection including Hell. The brothers subsequently made a very similar, though more extensive, work called Fucking Hell.
===Disputes with journalists===
In 2006, the journalist Lynn Barber claimed that she had received a death threat from the brothers, following conducting an interview with them.<ref name="Barber2">Lynn Barber urltoken "How I suffered for art's sake", The Observer, 1 October 2006, accessed 3 August 2008.</ref>
In 2007, they were criticised by journalist Johann Hari for adopting an anti-Enlightenment philosophy, and for Jake Chapman saying that the boys who murdered Liverpool toddler James Bulger performed "a good social service".<ref>Johann Hari urltoken "The art of subverting the Enlightenment" , The Independent, 5 February 2007.

===Art by Adolf Hitler===
In May 2008, White Cube gallery exhibited 13 apparently authenticated watercolours painted by Adolf Hitler, to which the brothers had added hippie motifs.<ref> urltoken "Hitler gets Chapman treatment as Hell rises from the ashes" The Guardian, 30 May 2008, retrieved 25 February 2009</ref> Jake Chapman described most of the dictator's works as "awful landscapes" which they had "prettified".<ref></ref> The central device and context of this exhibition were strikingly similar to those of the artist Ira Waldron in her project "Die Damen mit den Hündchen", first exhibited at the Thessaloniki Biennale of Contemporary art in May 2007.<ref> urltoken "Ira Waldron, Die Damen mit den Hűndchen" Tsantsanoglou, Maria, May 2007, Catalogue entry for 1st Thessaloniki Biennale of Contemporary Art", State Museum of Contemporary Art, Thessaloniki, Greece, May 2007, retrieved 3 April 2015.</ref> Waldron also entered into an artistic duel with Hitler, seen as a mediocre bohemian artist,<ref> urltoken "Салоники – Гетеротопии" Литический, Георгий, 4 июня 2007г, Первая Биеннале Современного Искусства, 21.05–30.09.2007, Информагентство Культура; Litichevsky, Georgy, 4 June 2007, "Thessaloniki – Heterotopias", First Biennale of Contemporary Art, 21.05 – 30 September 2007", Informagentstvo Kultura, Gif.ru.

In 2011, in their "Human Rainbow" and "Introspastic" series, the Chapman Brothers produced further works based on the same Hitler drawings of Geli Raubal and his dogs which had been previously appropriated by Ira Waldron in her 2007 exhibition.
===Letter to Culture Secretary===
On 1 October 2010, in an open letter to the British government's Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt – co-signed by a further 27 previous Turner Prize nominees, and 19 winners – the brothers opposed any future cuts in public funding for the arts. In the letter the cosignatories described the arts in Britain as a "remarkable and fertile landscape of culture and creativity."<ref>Peter Walker, " urltoken Turner prize winners lead protest against arts cutbacks," The Guardian, 1 October 2010.</ref>
==Personal lives==
===Jake Chapman===
Jake married the fashion model Rosemary Ferguson in 2004. They have one child and live in Filkins, Oxfordshire.
In August 2014 Chapman was quoted as saying that taking children to art galleries is a "total waste of time", stating that "children are not human yet." The comment caused other notable artists to speak out against Chapman's thoughts.<ref></ref>
BBC Art Critic, Will Gompertz referred to a defining characteristic of the "YBAs" being their ability to manipulate biddable media to get attention:
:The formula is simple: When you have an exhibition to promote, say something mildly inflammatory to the press, and watch the column inches (particularly in August) and ticket sales soar.
:Jake Chapman's comment about kids and paintings is a beautifully crafted example of the art. It has generated loads of attention, reinforced the brothers' bad-boy brand, and alerted an "outraged" middle England to the Chapmans' new show. Job done.
===Dinos Chapman===
Dinos is married to Tiphaine de Lussy. They have two daughters; Bliss (born 2005) and Blythe (born 2006) and live in Spitalfields, London.<ref>Danielle Demetriou, " urltoken My Home: Dinos Chapman, artist," The Independent, 13 June 2007</ref>
Both are members of Arts Emergency, a British charity working with 16- to 19-year-olds in further education from diverse backgrounds.<ref></ref>

Iakovos "Jake" (born 1966) and Konstantinos "Dinos" (born 1962) are British visual artists, often known as the Chapman Brothers. Their subject matter tries to be deliberately shocking, including, in 2008, a series of works that appropriated original watercolours by Adolf Hitler. 
In the mid-1990s, their sculptures were included in the YBA showcase exhibitions Brilliant! and Sensation. In 2003, the two were nominated for the annual Turner Prize but lost out to Grayson Perry. In 2013, their painting One Day You Will No Longer Be Loved III was the subject of Derren Brown's Channel 4 special, The Great Art Robbery.
