European green woodpecker

==Taxonomy==
The European green woodpecker was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under its current binomial name Picus viridis.<ref></ref> The type locality is Sweden.<ref></ref> The scientific name is derived from the Latin picus, meaning "woodpecker", and viridis meaning "green".<ref></ref> It is member of the order Piciformes and the woodpecker family Picidae.<ref name=ioc/>
There are three subspecies,<ref name=ioc></ref> with subtle and mostly clinal differences between them.<ref name="baker"/>
* P. v. viridis Linnaeus, 1758, which breeds in Europe south to France (except south Roussillon where it is replaced by the Iberian green woodpecker), the Alps, Croatia, Slovenia and Romania
* P. v. karelini von Brandt, JF, 1841, which breeds in Italy, south-east Europe south from Northern Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria, Asia Minor, northern Iran and south-west Turkmenistan. It has duller green upperparts, cheeks and underparts than viridis
* P. v. innominatus (Zarudny & Loudon, 1905), which breeds in south-west and southern Iran, is like karelini but with nearly white cheeks, throat and chest and more defined barring on the tail.<ref name="baker"/>
The Iberian green woodpecker (Picus sharpei) and Levaillant's woodpecker (Picus vaillantii) were formerly considered as subspecies of the European green woodpecker. They are now treated as separate species based on the results of two molecular phylogenetic studies published in 2011.<ref name=ioc/><ref></ref><ref></ref>
==Description==
The European green woodpecker measures in length with a wingspan. Both sexes are green above and pale yellowish green below, with yellow rump and red crown and nape; the moustachial stripe has a red centre in the male but is solid black in the female. The lores and around the white eye are black in both male and female, except in the Iberian race P. v. subsp. sharpei, in which it is dark grey and males have only a lower black border to the moustache. Juveniles are spotty and streaked all over;<ref name="collins"></ref> the moustache is dark initially, though juvenile males can show some red feathers by early June or usually by July or August.<ref name="baker"></ref>
Moult takes place between June and November with the first flight feathers being lost around the time the young fledge. Juveniles moult quickly after fledging and gain their adult plumage between August and November.<ref>RSPB Handbook of British Birds (2014). .</ref>
Although the European green woodpecker is shy and wary, it is usually its loud calls, known as yaffling, which first draw attention. It 'drums' rarely (a soft, fast roll), but often gives a noisy kyü-kyü-kyück while flying. The song is a loud series of 10–18 'klü' sounds which gets slightly faster towards the end and falls slightly in pitch.<ref name="collins"/> The female makes a thinner pü-pü-pü-pü-pü-pü-pü.<ref name="jonsson"></ref> The flight is undulating, with 3–4 wingbeats followed by a short glide when the wings are held by the body.<ref name="bwpi"></ref>
It can be distinguished from the similar, but smaller, grey-headed woodpecker by its yellowish, not grey, underparts, and the black lores and facial 'mask'.<ref name="baker"/> In Europe, its green upperparts and yellow rump can lead to confusion with the grey-headed woodpecker or possibly the female golden oriole, though the latter is smaller and more slender with narrower wings and longer tail. The closely related,<ref name="bwpi"/> very similar Levaillant's woodpecker occurs only in north-west Africa.<ref name="collins"/>
==Distribution and habitat==
.<ref name="bwpi"/>
The European green woodpecker has a large range and an Estimated Global Extent of Occurrence of between 1 million to 10 million square kilometres, and a population in the region of 920,000 to 2.9 million birds. Populations appear to be stable, so the species is considered of Least Concern.<ref name="bli"></ref> The species is highly sedentary<ref name="jonsson"/> and individuals rarely move more than around 500&nbsp;m between breeding seasons.<ref name="bwpi"/>
A combination of old deciduous trees for nesting, and nearby feeding grounds with plenty of ants, is essential. This is usually found in semi-open landscapes with small woodlands, hedges, scattered old trees, edges of forests and floodplain forests. Suitable habitats for foraging include grassland, heaths, Forestry, orchards and lawns.<ref name="bli"/>
==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
The nesting hole is larger but similar to those of the other woodpeckers. It may be a few feet above the ground or at the top of a tall tree; oaks, beeches, Salix and fruit trees are the preferred nest trees in western and central Europe, and aspens in the north.<ref name="bin"/> The hole may be excavated in sound or rotten wood, with an entrance hole of . The cavity inside may be 150&nbsp;mm wide and up to deep<ref name="tracks"></ref> and the work is performed mostly by the male over 15–30 days. Some tree holes are used for breeding for more than 10 years, but not necessarily by the same pair.<ref name="bwpi"/>
There is a single brood of four to six white eggs, measuring and weighing each, of which 7% is shell. After the last egg is laid, they are incubated for 19–20 days by both parents taking shifts of between 1.5 and 2.5 hours.<ref name="bwpi"/> The chicks are naked and altricial at hatching and fledge after 21–24 days.<ref name="bto"/>
===Food and feeding===
The main food of the European green woodpecker is ants of the Genus Lasius and Formica<ref name="bli"/> for which it spends much of its time foraging on the ground,<ref name="collins"/> though other insects and small reptiles are also taken occasionally.<ref name="bwpi"/> The bird's distinctive, elongated, cylindrical droppings often consist entirely of ant remains.<ref name="tracks"/> At ant nests, it probes into the ground and licks up adult ants and their larvae.<ref name="bwpi"/> They have tongues that wrap to the back of their head.<ref name=tongue></ref> Green woodpeckers will often forage in short grazed or mown permanent grasslands where the availability of ant nests is high.<ref>Alder, D., & Marsden, S. (2010). Characteristics of feeding‐site selection by breeding Green Woodpeckers Picus viridis in a UK agricultural landscape. Bird study, 57(1), 100–107.</ref>
leftA study of a nest in Romania found that 10 species of ant were fed to the chicks. During the first 10 days, the young received an average of each, from days 10–20, , and from day 20, . The seven chicks consumed an estimated 1.5 million ants and pupae before leaving the nest.<ref name="bwpi"/>
The beak is relatively weak and used for pecking in soft wood only.<ref name="bwpi"/> In common with other woodpecker species,<ref></ref> the green woodpecker's tongue is long (10&nbsp;cm) and has to be curled around its skull.<ref name="bto"></ref> It lacks the barbs of the Dendrocopos woodpeckers and black woodpecker,<ref name="bwpi"/> but is made sticky by secretions from the enlarged salivary glands.<ref name="bwpi"/> Heavy, prolonged snow cover makes feeding difficult for the green woodpecker and can result in high mortality, from which it may take 10 years for the population to recover.<ref name="bli"/> Ant nests can be located under the snow; one bird was observed to dig 85&nbsp;cm to reach a nest.<ref name="bwpi"/>
==In culture==
'Professor Yaffle', the wooden bookend character in the 1974 children's animation series Bagpuss,<ref></ref> was based loosely upon the green woodpecker.<ref></ref> 'Yaffle' was among many England folk names for the European green woodpecker relating to its laughing call; others include laughing Betsey, yaffingale, yappingale and Jack Eikle. Other names, including rain-bird, weather cock and wet bird, suggest its supposed ability to bring on rain.<ref name="air"></ref><ref></ref> The species has been the subject of postage stamps from several countries.<ref></ref> The European green woodpecker is associated with Woodpecker Cider, an image of the bird is used on the merchandise.<ref> urltoken Woodpecker Cider Retrieved 17 November 2011</ref> The woodpecker was the totem of the Italic tribe of the Picentes,<ref></ref> and features of the coat of arms and flag of the Italian region of the Marche.<ref></ref>

The European green woodpecker is a large green woodpecker with a bright red crown and a black moustache. Males have a red centre to the moustache stripe which is absent in females. It is resident across much of Europe and the western Palearctic but in Spain and Portugal it is replaced by the similar Iberian green woodpecker (Picus sharpei).
The European green woodpecker spends much of its time feeding on ants on the ground and does not often 'drum' on trees like other woodpecker species. It is a shy bird but usually draws attention with its loud calls. A nest hole is excavated in a tree; four to six eggs are laid which hatch after 19–20 days.
