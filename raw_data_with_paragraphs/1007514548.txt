== Personal life and death==
=== Family ===
His first marriage, to Patricia LaLonde (October 13, 1952 – 1966), ended in divorce. They had four children: Tony (born 1953), Michael (born 1954), Linda (born 1956) and Scott (born 1958).
Stuart remarried, to France Caroline Boubis (1966–74). They had one son together, Justin, before divorcing in 1974. In 2006, he wed Julia Paradiz, a Russian woman he met at a friend's wedding in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1971.<ref name="Omaha"></ref><ref></ref>
=== Friendships and commentary on collaborators ===
In an interview, Whitman said that he and Broderick Crawford clicked upon meeting on the set of Highway Patrol. Whenever Whitman was low on cash he would tell Crawford, who continued to re-invite him. Both would hang-out outside of the workplace. Later, Whitman helped Crawford to be cast in The Decks Ran Red.
Another The Decks Ran Red co-star Whitman commented on was Dorothy Dandridge, who was going through a divorce and had to institutionalize her mentally ill daughter. Whitman was impressed with her strength and described her as a goddess.
Whitman told that when he first met Peter Falk on the set of Murder, Inc., they had differences but eventually became friends. Whitman found The Mark director Guy Green difficult to work with, finding him demanding and too strict, but they became good friends afterwards. On the set of Sands of the Kalahari, Whitman said he became best friends with fellow cast members Stanley Baker and Theodore Bikel, while he didn't click with Jim Brown at first, they too became friends.
In the same piece, Whitman said that Terry-Thomas was one of his best friends. After their collaboration on Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines, both would meet for drinks, visit one another, and swim in the ocean while on Whitman's beachfront home in Malibu.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5" /><ref name=":6" />

== Quotes ==
Whitman said in 1961, "I've had to battle and say what is an actor? It's a fellow who plays someone else. But now I realize it's the image that makes a star. John Wayne is a great example of a super actor. Gary Cooper is another one. My image? I think it's being free and easy and all man. I say to myself I want to become an actor, I want to lose myself in each role. But that's not the way to become an actor."<ref name="mark" />
In a 1991 Los Angeles Times interview,<ref></ref> Whitman said, "I was bankable for a while, then I did a couple of shows that didn’t make any money. Then I wasn’t bankable. As an actor, you’ve got to keep working. You’ve got to do something to feed the family, put the kids through school."
Whitman's private fortune continued to grow on a combination of his property developments and acting income.<ref name="Meyer" /> "I didn't need to act to make a living, but had a real passion for it – I just loved to act," said Whitman.<ref name="Omaha" />
