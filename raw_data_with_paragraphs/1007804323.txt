==History of Fuji TV==
Fuji Television Network Inc. was founded in 1957 by Nobutaka Shikanai and Shigeo Mizuno, presidents of Nippon Broadcasting System and Nippon Cultural Broadcasting respectively.<ref></ref> It started broadcasting on March 1959.<ref></ref> In June of that year, Fuji TV formed a network with Tokai TV, Kansai TV, and KBC Television. In October 1966, a news network of exchanging news with local stations with the name of FNN (Fuji News Network) was formed.
On April 1, 1986, Fuji TV changed their corporate logo from the old "Channel 8" logo, to the "Medama" logo used by the Fujisankei Communications Group. In 1986 and 1987, Fuji TV worked with Nintendo to create two games called All Night Nippon Super Mario Bros. and Yume Kojo: Doki Doki Panic for the Famicom. All Night Nippon Super Mario Bros. was a retooled version of Super Mario Bros. with some minor changes, such as normal levels being replaced with levels from Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels and some enemies being replaced with Japanese celebrities with comedic effect. Yume Kojo: Doki Doki Panic later became the basis for Super Mario Bros. 2, which was subsequently released a year later.
In October 1987, Fuji TV began branding their late-night/early-morning slots collectively as JOCX-TV2 (meaning "alternative JOCX-TV") in an effort to market the traditionally unprofitable time slots and give opportunities to young creators to express their new ideas. JOCX-TV2 featured numerous experimental programs on low budgets under this and follow-on brands, a notable example being Zuiikin' English which first aired in spring 1992. The JOCX-TV2 branding itself was changed in October 1989 to JOCX-TV+, which lasted until September 1991, when it was replaced with :ja:GARDEN (コマーシャル) in October 1991. Meanwhile, Fuji TV helped produced only the third series of the British children's television programme Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends (now called Thomas & Friends) with its creator and producer Britt Allcroft. The GARDEN/JOCX-MIDNIGHT branding lasted until September 1992 when it was replaced with the JUNGLE branding, which lasted from October 1992 to September 1993. The JOCX-MIDNIGHT branding was introduced in October 1993 to replace the previous JUNGLE branding, and lasted until March 1996 when Fuji TV decided to stop branding their late-night/early-morning slots.
On March 10, 1997, Fuji TV moved from their old headquarters in Kawadacho, Shinjuku, into a new building in Odaiba, Minato designed by Kenzo Tange.
Since 2002, Fuji TV has co-sponsored the Clarion Girl contest, held annually to select a representative for Clarion who will represent Clarion's car audio products in television and print advertising campaigns during the following year.
On April 1, 2006, Fuji TV split up the radio broadcasting and station license of Nippon Broadcasting System into a newly established company with the same name. The remaining of the old Nippon Broadcasting System was dissolved into Fuji TV. This resulted in the assets of Nippon Broadcasting System being transferred over to Fuji TV.<ref> urltoken 
On October 1, 2008, Fuji TV became a certified broadcasting holding company and newly founded "Fuji Television Network Inc." took over the broadcasting business.<ref> urltoken 
Fuji TV, which broadcasts Formula One in Japan since 1987, is the only media sponsor of a Formula One Grand Prix in the world. Fuji TV has also licensed numerous Formula One video games including Human Grand Prix IV: F1 Dream Battle.

==Controversies==
On August 7–21, 2011, more than 2,000 protesters from Japanese Culture Channel Sakura and other groups rallied in front of Fuji Television and Fuji Media Holdings' headquarters in Odaiba, Tokyo to demonstrate against what they perceived as the network's increased use of South Korean content, information manipulation and insulting treatment of Japanese people. Channel Sakura called Fuji TV the "Traitor Network" in these protests.<ref></ref><ref name="variety"></ref><ref></ref>
Further on June 29, 2015, Fuji TV apologized for running subtitles during a show earlier in the month that inaccurately described South Koreans interviewed on the street as saying they “hate” Japan. The apology came after a successful online petition over the weekend, with people stating the major broadcaster had fabricated the subtitles to breed Anti-Korean sentiment amongst the Japanese public. Fuji TV explained that both interviewees indeed spoke of their dislike of Japan during the interviews, but it accidentally ran clips that didn't contain that message. According to the broadcaster, “we aired these inaccurate clips because of a mix-up during the editing process as well as our failure to check the final footage sufficiently.”<ref></ref><ref></ref>
