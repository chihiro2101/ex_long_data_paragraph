Ratite

===Loss of flight===
Loss of flight allows birds to eliminate the costs of maintaining various flight-enabling like high pectoral muscle mass, hollow bones and a light build, et cetera.<ref name = Mcnab1994 /> The basal metabolic rate of flighted species is much higher than that of flightless terrestrial birds.<ref name="Cubo"/> But energetic efficiency can only help explain the loss of flight when the benefits of flying are not critical to survival.
Research on flightless rails indicates the flightless condition evolved in the absence of predators.<ref name="Mcnab2006" /> This shows flight to be generally necessary for survival and dispersal in birds.<ref name="Diamond1991" /> In apparent contradiction to this, many landmasses occupied by ratites are also inhabited by predatory mammals.<ref name="Mitchell2014" /> However, the K–Pg extinction event created a window of time with large predators absent that may have allowed the ancestors of ratites to evolve flightlessness.<ref name="Phillips2010" /> They subsequently underwent selection for large size.<ref name="Phillips2010" /> One hypothesis suggests that as predation pressure decreases on islands with low raptor species richness and no mammalian predators, the need for large, powerful flight muscles that make for a quick escape decreases.<ref name = "Wright2016"/> Moreover, raptor species tend to become generalist predators on islands with low species richness, as opposed to specializing in the predation of birds. An increase in leg size compensates for a reduction in wing length in insular birds that have not lost flight by providing a longer lever to increase force generated during the thrust that initiates takeoff.<ref name = "Wright2016" />
== Description ==
Ratites in general have many physical characteristics in common, which are often not shared by the family Tinamidae, or tinamous. First, the breast muscles are underdeveloped. They do not have keeled sterna. Their wishbones (furculae) are almost absent. They have a simplified wing skeletons and musculature. Their legs are stronger and do not have air chambers, except the femurs. Their tail and flight feathers have retrogressed or have become decorative plumes. They have no feather vanes, which means they do not need to oil their feathers, hence they have no preen glands. They have no separation of pterylae (feathered areas) and apteria (non-feathered areas),<ref> urltoken for definitions of the two latin words</ref> and finally, they have palaeognathous palates.<ref name = Bruning />
Ostriches have the greatest dimorphism, rheas show some dichromatism during the breeding season. Emus, cassowaries, and kiwis show some dimorphism, predominantly in size.
While the ratites share a lot of similarities, they also have major differences. Ostriches have only two toes, with one being much larger than the other. Cassowaries have developed long inner toenails, used defensively. Ostriches and rheas have prominent wings; although they don't use them to fly, they do use them in courtship and predator distraction.<ref name = "Bruning" />
Without exception, ratite chicks are capable of swimming and even diving.
On an allometric basis, paleognaths have generally smaller brains than neognaths. Kiwis are exceptions to this trend, and possess proportionally larger brains comparable to those of parrots and songbirds, though evidence for similar advanced cognitive skills is currently lacking.<ref name="Corfield2007"/>

== Behavior and ecology ==
=== Feeding and diet ===
Ratite chicks tend to be more omnivorous or insectivorous; similarities in adults end with feeding, as they all vary in diet and length of digestive tract, which is indicative of diet. Ostriches, with the longest tracts at , are primarily herbivorous. Rheas' tracts are next longest at , and they also have caeca. They are also mainly herbivores, concentrating on broad-leafed plants. However, they will eat insects if the opportunity arises. Emus have tracts of length, and have a more omnivorous diet, including insects and other small animals. Cassowaries have next to the shortest tracts at . Finally, kiwi have the shortest tracts and eat earthworms, insects, and other similar creatures.<ref name = "Bruning" /> Moas and elephant birds were the largest native herbivores in their faunas, far larger than contemporary herbivorous mammals in the latter's case.<ref name="Buffetaut2014" />
Some extinct ratites might have had odder lifestyles, such as the narrow-billed Diogenornis and Palaeotis, compared to the shorebird-like lithornithids, and could imply similar animalivorous diets.<ref name="Alvarenga"/><ref>Gerald Mayr, Paleogene Fossil Birds</ref>
=== Reproduction ===
Ratites are different from the flying birds in that they needed to adapt or evolve certain features to protect their young. First and foremost is the thickness of the shells of their eggs. Their young are hatched more developed than most and they can run or walk soon thereafter. Also, most ratites have communal nests, where they share the incubating duties with others. Ostriches are the only ratites where the female incubates; they share the duties, with the males incubating at night. Cassowaries and emu are polyandrous, with males incubating eggs and rearing chicks with no obvious contribution from females. Ostriches and rheas are polygynous with each male courting several females. Male rheas are responsible for building nests and incubating while ostrich males incubate only at night. Kiwis stand out as the exception with extended monogamous reproductive strategies where either the male alone or both sexes incubate a single egg.<ref name = "Bruning" /> Without exception, ratite chicks are capable of swimming and even diving.
== Ratites and humans ==
Ratites and humans have had a long relationship starting with the use of the egg for water containers, jewelry, or other art medium. Male ostrich feathers were popular for hats during the 18th century, which led to hunting and sharp declines in populations. Ostrich farming grew out of this need, and humans harvested feathers, hides, eggs, and meat from the ostrich. Emu farming also became popular for similar reasons and for their emu oil. Rhea feathers are popular for dusters, and eggs and meat are used for chicken and pet feed in South America. Ratite hides are popular for leather products like shoes.<ref name = "Bruning" />
=== United States regulation ===
The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) began a voluntary, fee-for-service ratite inspection program in 1995 to help the fledgling industry improve the marketability of the meat. A provision in the FY2001 USDA appropriations act (P.L. 106-387) amended the Poultry Products Inspection Act to make federal inspection of ratite meat mandatory as of April 2001 (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.).<ref name = "Womach2005" />

By 2014, a mitochondrial DNA phylogeny including fossil members placed ostriches on the basal branch, followed by rheas, then a clade consisting of moas and tinamous, followed by the final two branches: a clade of emus plus cassowaries and one of elephant birds plus kiwis.<ref name = "Mitchell2014" />
vicariance based on the plate tectonic split-up of Gondwana followed by continental drift would predict that the deepest phylogenetic split would be between African and all other ratites, followed by a split between South American and Australo-Pacific ratites, roughly as observed. However, the elephant bird–kiwi relation appears to require dispersal across oceans by flight,<ref name = "Mitchell2014" /> as apparently does the colonization of New Zealand by the moa and possibly the back-dispersal of tinamous to South America, if the latter occurred.<ref name = "Phillips2010" /> The phylogeny as a whole suggests not only multiple independent origins of flightlessness, but also of gigantism (at least five times).<ref name = "Mitchell2014" /> Gigantism in birds tends to be insular; however, a ten-million-year-long window of opportunity for evolution of avian gigantism on continents may have existed following the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, in which ratites were able to fill vacant herbivorous niches before mammals attained large size.<ref name = "Mitchell2014" /> Some authorities, though, have been skeptical of the new findings and conclusions.<ref name = "Zimmer2014" />
Kiwi and tinamous are the only palaeognath lineages not to evolve gigantism, perhaps because of competitive exclusion by giant ratites already present on New Zealand and South America when they arrived or arose.<ref name = "Mitchell2014" /> The fact that New Zealand has been the only land mass to recently support two major lineages of flightless ratites may reflect the absence of native mammals, which allowed kiwi to occupy a mammal-like nocturnal niche.<ref name="Le DucRenaud2015"/> However, various other landmasses such as South America and Europe have supported multiple lineages of flightless ratites that evolved independently, undermining this competitive exclusion hypothesis.<ref name="Agnolin2016"/>
Most recently, studies on genetic and morphological divergence and fossil distribution show that paleognaths as a whole probably had an origin in the northern hemisphere. Early Cenozoic northern hemisphere paleognaths such as Lithornis, Pseudocrypturus, Paracathartes and Palaeotis appear to be the most basal members of the clade.<ref name="Yonezawa2017" /> The various ratite lineages were probably descended from flying ancestors that independently colonised South America and Africa from the north, probably initially in South America. From South America they could have traveled overland to Australia via Antarctica,<ref name = "Tambussi1994"/> (by the same route marsupials are thought to have used to reach Australia<ref name = "Nilsson2010"/>) and then reached New Zealand and Madagascar via "sweepstakes" dispersals across the oceans. Gigantism would have evolved subsequent to trans-oceanic dispersals.<ref name="Yonezawa2017" />
