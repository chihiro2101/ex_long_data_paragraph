Oneida Limited

==History==
===Origins===
The company arose out of the utopian Oneida Community, which was established in Oneida, New York, in 1848.<ref>C. N. Robertson, Oneida Community: An autobiography, 1851-1876. Syracuse: University Press, 1970. pp. 14-23.</ref> The Oneida Association (later Oneida Community) was founded by a small group of Christian perfectionists led by John Humphrey Noyes, Jonathan Burt, George W. Cragin, Harriet A.Noyes, George W. Noyes, John L. Skinner and a few others.<ref>C. N. Robertson,Oneida Community, an autobiography. pp. 10-15.</ref> In 1880, after more than 30 years operating as a commune, the Oneida Community voted to transfer much of the common property to a joint-stock company to be known as Oneida Community Ltd. effective January 1, 1881.<ref>C.N. Robertson, Oneida Community, the breakup, 1876-1881. Syracuse: University Press, 1972. pp. 301-311.</ref>
Oneida Community Ltd. was one of the earliest joint-stock companies in the United States. Its founders' religious philosophy helped inform the early development of the company, in which members of the former Oneida Community became shareholders in the company. Its progressive nature also allowed for a woman, Harriet Joselyn, to sit on the board of directors — a departure from the norm for the time.<ref name="OneidaStory"></ref>
Oneida Community started production of silver-plated flatware and Holloware in 1899 using the "Community Plate" mark. Oneida Community purchased the Wm A. Rogers and 1881 Rogers companies in 1929 and started producing a somewhat lower-quality line of products using those companies’ marks. In 1935, Oneida Community changed its name to Oneida Ltd.<ref></ref>
===Post-war growth===
Oneida Limited successfully adapted to the difficult economic conditions of the First World War and Second World War. Throughout both of these world economic upheavals, Oneida adapted its manufacturing capabilities. During the First World War, it produced ammunition clips, lead-plated gas shells, combat knives, and surgical instruments; during World War II, the company added army trucks, aircraft survival kits, and even jet engine parts to its manufacturing repertoire.<ref name="OneidaStory"/>
The company then managed an innovative transition to the manufacture of stainless steel flatware in 1961, which eventually dwarfed its production of silver-plated flatware.<ref name="Replacements"></ref> In 1971, Oneida purchased the Camden Wire Co., Inc., a major manufacturer of industrial wire products.
By the 1980s, Oneida made at least half of all flatware purchased in the United States.<ref name="OneidaStory"/> In 1983, the company acquired Rena-Ware, a Bellevue-based kitchenware manufacturer with a majority international operations. Oneida sold Rena-ware three years later.<ref></ref> In 1984, it acquired D.J. Tableware, a flatware and china manufacturer that targeted the foodservice industry.
===Modern era===
At the end of the 1990s, the company encountered tough economic times, however it still tried to hold on to its mantle as the last remaining US-based manufacturer of flatware, knives, forks, and spoons. The events surrounding 9/11 negatively affected the hospitality and consumer tableware markets, and in November 2003, Oneida sold its 100-year-old Buffalo China plant and four overseas factories in Mexico, China, and Italy.<ref></ref> In February 2004, it sold off more assets to BC Acquisition Co. LLC for $5.5 million.<ref> urltoken "Oneida Ltd. Finds Buyer For Buffalo China's Assets"</ref> Eventually, the manufacturing facilities in Sherrill, New York were sold to Sherrill manufacturing on March 22, 2005.<ref> urltoken "Sherrill Manufacturing resumes flatware production with boost from Internet retailer"</ref>
In 1996, Oneida Limited acquired THC Systems, Inc., including its team of professionals, which operated under the name Rego China.<ref> urltoken "Oneida Ltd. Acquires China Importing Firm"</ref>
Oneida Limited transitioned from its manufacturing history and focused on design and marketing of its products that are globally sourced. Sales, marketing, advertising, procurement, customer service, legal and operational support is also still based in Oneida, New York. The company was taken private in 2006. Oneida no longer operates manufacturing in the United States.<ref name="OneidaStory"/>
Partly as a consequence of the economic blowback from 9/11, Oneida Limited's sales fell more than $157 million.<ref name="NYT"></ref> In 2006, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. After stabilizing financially and reducing its debt load, the company was purchased by a group of hedge funds led by Monarch Alternative Capital.<ref name="NYT"/>
Oneida announced at the beginning of 2009 they were transitioning away from company-owned outlet stores due to poor financial results but retaining the original outlet store in Sherrill, New York.<ref> urltoken "Oneida Ltd. closing outlet stores"</ref><ref> urltoken |Company Store</ref> In September 2010, Oneida launched a new website, Oneida.com.
In November 2011, Oneida Limited was acquired by Monomoy Capital Partners, a mid-sized New York City equity fund.<ref> urltoken "Oneida Ltd. president sees bright future under new buyer"</ref><ref> urltoken Monomoy Capital Partners website</ref> In 2012 Monomoy merged Oneida with Anchor Hocking and created EveryWare Global.<ref></ref> In January 2014, EveryWare Global announced its plans to close its regional office and the Oneida outlet store, both in Sherrill, NY, with the process starting in April.<ref></ref> 
The original Oneida outlet store in Sherrill, New York, was closed April 26, 2014.<ref> urltoken EveryWare Global filed for bankruptcy in 2015.<ref> urltoken Monomoy-backed EveryWare Global to file for bankruptcy</ref> EveryWare Global was renamed The Oneida Group in 2017.<ref> urltoken EveryWare Global Changes Corporate Name to The Oneida Group</ref>

===Manufacturing===
Oneida has had a variety of manufacturing facilities and capabilities throughout its existence. In addition to tableware, the company started out by manufacturing silk, traps, and chains. It gradually ceased these enterprises as they became less profitable for the company. In 1916, Oneida opened its first international factory in Niagara Falls, Ontario.<ref name="OneidaStory"/>
During World War II, Oneida purchased a factory in Canastota, New York, to manufacture army trucks, aircraft survival kits, and jet engine parts.<ref name="OneidaStory"/>
Throughout the 1960s and 70s, Oneida's workforce grew from 2,000 to 3,000 workers, and it transitioned into manufacturing stainless steel flatware. Starting in 1977, and continuing throughout the 80s and 90s, Oneida acquired orthogonal manufacturing companies making such things as wire, flatware, and china. To compete with international manufacturing, Oneida implemented high-volume manufacturing lines in its factories. It also opened new factories throughout the world: a dinnerware factory in Juarez, Mexico; flatware factory in Toluca, Mexico; holloware factory in Shanghai, China; holloware factory in Vercelli, Italy.<ref name="auto"> urltoken "Oneida Completes Sale of Buffalo China Factory; Plant to Operate as Niagara Ceramics Corporation"</ref> In 2004, it closed those factories.
Since its acquisition by Monomoy Capital Partners, Oneida has manufactured its products across North America, South America, Asia, and Europe by means of 50 manufacturing contracts.<ref> urltoken "Oneida Limited buyout a 'home run'"</ref>
