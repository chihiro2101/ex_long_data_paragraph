The licensed district of was created in the city of Edo, near to the area today known as , itself close to the beginning of the road, the primary route to western Kyoto during the Edo period.
In 1656, due to the need for space as the city grew, the government decided to relocate , with plans being made to move the district to its present location north of on the outskirts of the city.
Having been established some decades earlier, the original district burned down, along with much of the city, in the Great fire of Meireki of 1657; it was then rebuilt in its new location, named ('New '), the old location being known as ('Original Yoshiwara'), though the moniker of 'new' was eventually dropped, with the rebuilt district becoming known simply as .<ref>Cecilia Segawa Seigle, Amy Reigle Newland, et al., A Courtesan's Day: Hour by Hour (Hotei, Amsterdam, 2004), pp. 9–11.</ref>
 was home to some 1,750 women in the 18th century, with records of some 3,000 women from all over Japan at one time. Many were typically indentured to their brothel; if indentured by their parents, a larger advance payment would often be received. Though contracts of indenture often did not last more than five to ten years, the debt sometimes accrued by these women could keep them working there for much longer. However, a significant number either served out their contracts and married a client, went into other employment (including other forms of prostitution), or returned to their family homes. In these cases, the advanced payments a woman's parents received could be used to fund her dowry.<ref>Embree, John F. Suye Mura: a Japanese Village, Ann Arbor: Center for Japanese Studies University of Michigan, 1995.</ref> Despite this, many women also died of sexually transmitted diseases, or following failed abortions, before completing their contracts.<ref>Sone Hiromi. “Prostitution and Public Authority in Early Modern Japan,” in Women and Class in Japanese History, edited by Hitomi Tonomura, Anne Walthall, and Haruko Wakita. 169-85.

If chosen to receive the correct training at a young age, a girl indentured to a brothel could become an apprentice to a high-ranking courtesan; when the girl was old enough and had completed her training, she would become a courtesan herself and work her way up the ranks. Another path to success and eventual freedom for a working woman in was for a rich man to buy out her contract from the brothel, and thus keep her as his wife or mistress; a further path would be for a woman to work successfully enough that she could eventually buy her own freedom, though this was an uncommon and infrequent occurrence.
Social classes were not strictly divided in ; a commoner with enough money would be served as an equal to a samurai, and though samurai were discouraged from entering , they often did so, the only requirement being that their weapons be left at the town's entrance. By law, brothel patrons were only allowed to stay for a night and a day at a time. Like all official policies for , this was rarely enforced.
Following its inception, became a strong commercial area, with the fashions created in the town by prostitutes changing frequently and creating a great demand for merchants and artisans. Traditionally, prostitutes were supposed to wear only simple blue robes, but this was rarely enforced. In contrast, the highest ranking (courtesans) came to be emblematic of the height of Edo period fashion, wearing colourful and expensive silk kimono alongside nihongami#tayū and a number of kanzashi; these outfits frequently dictated the contemporary trends of fashion in Japan of the time.
Despite the reputation of and its highest-ranking courtesans, most prostitutes working in the area came from poor families, would be commonly exploited, and were so poor that, when they died, their bodies would be brought anonymously to temple and left at the back entrance, a proper burial being too expensive to afford. The temple therefore also became known as ('Throw-away temple'); a memorial in the temple to thousands of anonymous prostitutes of was consecrated in the Meiji era.<ref></ref>
===19th, 20th and 21st century===
The area had over 9,000 women in 1893, many of whom suffered from syphilis,<ref>De Becker, J. E. The Nightless City, or The History of the Yoshiwara Yūkaku (Charles E. Tuttle, Tokyo, 1971), p. 360.</ref> In 1913, the area was damaged by an extensive fire, and further damaged to the point of near-obliteration a decade later by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. However, remained in business as a traditional red-light district until prostitution was outlawed by the Japanese government in 1958 following World War II.
Though technically illegal - with the definition of prostitution under the Anti-Prostitution Law being 'compensated penetrative sex with an unspecified person' other forms of sex work that do not violate this law continue to exist in the modern area of , with the portion of the town near station on the , now known as , retaining a large number of soaplands and other façades for sexual services.

People involved in ("the water trade"<ref>Dalby, Liza. Geisha (London: Vintage, 2000)</ref>) would include hōkan (comedians), kabuki (popular theatre of the time), dancers, dandies, rakes, tea-shop girls, Kanō (painters of the official school of painting), courtesans who resided in seirō (green houses) and geisha in their okiya houses.
The courtesans would consist of yūjo (women of pleasure/prostitutes), kamuro (young female students), shinzō (senior female students), hashi-jōro (lower-ranking courtesans), kōshi-jōro (high-ranking courtesans just below tayū), tayū (high-ranking courtesans), oiran, yarite (older chaperones for an oiran), and the yobidashi who replaced the tayū when they were priced out of the market.
In addition to courtesans, there were also geisha/geiko, maiko (apprentice geishas), otoko geisha (male geishas), danna (patrons of a geisha), and okaasan (geisha teahouse managers). The lines between geisha and courtesans were sharply drawn, however - a geisha was never to be sexually involved with a customer, though there were exceptions.<ref name="FTFW"/>

Today, Yoshiwara roughly corresponds to . At first glance, Yoshiwara today looks very similar to many other neighborhoods of modern Tokyo. Still, it does retain legacies to its past as it contains commercial establishments engaged in the sex trade, although police cracked down on the Soapland in 2007.<ref>Screiber, Mark, "A soapland cleanup that could make a mess", Japan Times, 22 July 2011, p. 17.</ref> The street grid pattern and the temples and shrines from times past still exist.<ref>Waley, P. pp. 201–211.</ref>

Created by the shogunate to curtail the tastes of and sequester the nouveau riche (merchant) classes, the entertainment offered in , alongside other licensed districts, would eventually give rise to the creation of geisha, who would become known as the fashionable companions of the classes and simultaneously cause the demise of , the upper-class courtesans of the red-light districts.
