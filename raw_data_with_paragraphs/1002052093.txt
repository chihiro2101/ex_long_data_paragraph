Red-winged blackbird

===Negative aspects: consumption of cultivated grains===
The red-winged blackbirds can devastate farm fields. Despite the fact that they consume weed seeds, they are known to cause great damage to agriculture due to their habits of resting in massive groups and their taste for agricultural products.<ref name=animaldiversity/> may be also causes harm to plantings corn, rice, sunflower and sorghum,<ref name=animaldiversity/><ref name="De Grazio 1964"></ref> particularly important near roosts.<ref name="De Grazio 1964"/> Red-winged blackbird is the largest species of jaundice in North America and the most damaging to crops.<ref></ref><ref name="De Grazio 1964"/><ref></ref> From 215 birds Neotropical migrants have been identified as causing, by a wide margin, the greatest economic loss.<ref name="auto10"/> In North America, the damage to corn crops by this species has increased since the late 1960s to early 1980s, perhaps because of the increase in the area for grain production,<ref></ref><ref name="Clark et al 1986"></ref><ref></ref> and due to the reduction of small areas with stubble, hayfields and uncultivated land, which, in turn, accentuated the bird's dependence on corn to ensure its livelihood.<ref></ref>
Apparently, the male does more damage to this grain than the female. In some areas of Ohio, corn can account for up to 75% of the diet of males and only 6% of that of females in August and September. In South Dakota, in the late summer, the Gizzards of the males studied contained 29% corn, while in the case of the female that number was limited to 9%.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/>
===Situation in the Midwest===
The red-winged blackbird is the dominant species in the large concentrations of jaundices that feed on the fields of sunflower, corn and small grains maturing in late summer or early fall in the Dakotas. In the 1970s, losses to sunflower and corn crops caused by jaundices in the Dakotas exceeded $3 million annually for each case.<ref></ref> In the northern part of the Great Plains, an area known as the Prairie Pothole Region, in red-winged blackbirds are very abundant in summer, they congregate in post-reproductive flocks that significantly harm crops, particularly sunflower plantations near their home sites. Most sunflower damage occurs between mid-August and early September, when the calorie content of immature seeds is low and birds must consume more of them to satiate themselves. During this initial stage of predation on sunflower crops in which more than 75% of the total damage is caused, the sergeant thrushes represent 80% of the jaundices observed in the fields of this seed. This period predates the massive migration of birds and most of them are of local origin. Most remain within 200 km of their native sites until the molting of their feathers is complete or nearly complete in late August or early September. Damage can be quite serious in the center and southeast of North Dakota and Northeast South Dakota, areas of high concentration of sunflower production and abundant wetlands that attract sergeant thrushes during the breeding season.<ref name="Homan et al 2004"></ref>
Investigations conducted between 1968 and 1979 revealed that jaundices notably the black-winged blackbird and the Common grackle, annually destroyed less than 1% of corn crops in Ohio, amounting to a loss between 4 and 6 million dollars according to 1979 prices. Insects, weeds, diseases and fungi. They are likely to cause losses of more than 20% of the total potential maize harvest in the Midwest states, and harvesting procedures often leave 5% or more of the maize in the fields, revealing that comparative damage by Ichteridae in Ohio is not great. However, the average damage caused by these birds is not of as much economic importance as its distribution among producers. While 97.5% of cornfields studied in Ohio suffered a loss of less than 5%, which constituted about 60% of the total damage in the state, the remaining 2.5% often incurred losses of more than 5% and represented approximately 40% of total injury in Ohio.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/>
All Ohio counties experience some degree of predation on their maize crops from jaundices, but those most affected are a few counties where marshes that roost them still abound. The counties of Ottawa , Sandusky and Lucas , on the waters of Sandusky Bay and Lake Erie, were the hardest hit. These three counties, among the 19 studied between 1968 and 1976, contained 62% of the fields in which the losses exceeded 5% and 77% of those in which they exceeded 10%. Other counties with extensive localized damage were Erie, Ashtabula also located on the coasts of the mentioned water courses and Hamilton. Almost all the plantations with damages greater than 5% were within 8 km of some important roosting of jaundices. In the 1968-1976 period, in northeast Sandusky County and northwest Ottawa, where large roosts of up to a million birds were discovered in late summer and fall, average losses exceeded 9% in fields 3 to 5 km from the roosts, but they were less than 5% at 8 km and less than 2% at 16 km.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/> In southwestern Ontario, in the summer of 1964, it was found that the greatest damage to the cornfields by sergeant thrus also occurred near roosts in swamps.<ref name=Dyer1967></ref>
== Pest control ==
The two main options that farmers can choose from to avoid the presence of birds once corn has entered the milky stage of its maturation process are the use of the chemical 4-aminopyridine and the implementation of mechanical devices to frighten birds away.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/> The time chosen to take measures to disperse the jaundices is of great importance since once the birds have chosen a field to feed there they are likely to return for several days.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/><ref name=Dyer1967/> The longer be allowed to feed them unmolested, will become more difficult to scare them away.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/> Also, most of the damage is inflicted in just a few days, when the pimples are soft; consequently, control techniques will not be very useful if applied after this period.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/><ref name=Dolbeer2008></ref>
===Pest control history===
As early as 1667, Massachusetts Bay settlers had enacted laws to try to reduce jaundice populations and mitigate damage to corn. According to Henry David Thoreau, a law provided that each single man in a town must kill six of those birds and, as a punishment for not doing so, he could not marry until he had complied with the aforementioned design. Obviously, since jaundices reproduce at a much higher speed than humans marry, this control strategy was a failure. Pioneers traveling west to the Great Lakes region faced similar problems. By 1749, jaundices were so abundant around western Lake Erie that people took turns watching over the maturing grain crops.
At the beginning of the 20th century, in some places, when the reeds dried up, these circumstances were used to kill these birds in the following way. A crew approached a roost in silence, hidden in the darkness of the night, and simultaneously lit the reeds at various points, which were quickly enveloped by a single great flame. This caused a huge tumult among the sergeant thrushes, which, lit by fire, were shot down in large numbers as they hovered in midair and screamed all over the place. Sometimes straw was used for the same purpose, which was previously scattered near reeds and alder bushes (Alnus spp.) in which they gathered to rest, the burning of which caused great consternation among the birds. The gang returned the next day to collect the hunted prey.<ref name=birdsbybent/>
Arthur Cleveland Bent says that, before it was banned the sale of prey hunting in the market, Sergeant thrushes were massacred in large numbers in autumn and sold in markets. When they had put on weight on a diet of grains or rice, their small bodies were served as delicious snacks on the gourmet tables . Few could distinguish them from charlatans (Dolichonyx oryzivorus).<ref name=birdsbybent/>
In 1926, when the US Biological Survey - predecessor of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service carried out its first compilation of roosts of undesirable ichterids, it was recorded in Ohio, with its large populations of these birds and the fifth largest area allocated to the cultivation of corn among the American states, a number of complaints higher than in any other state. During the 1950s, bird control committees were organized in some counties to deal with the damage to maize caused by jaundices and the Ohio Agricultural Experiment Station now the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center and the Department of Zoology and Entomology of the state university began investigating the problem.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/>
===Use of deadly traps and chemicals===
Crop predation has led to the use of traps , poison and surfactants by farmers in an attempt to control populations of sergeant thrush;<ref name=animaldiversity/> these last properties suppress waterproof feathers, making them extremely vulnerable to the cold,<ref name=Dyer1967/><ref name="Lefebvre & Seubert 1970"></ref> but their effectiveness depends on certain atmospheric conditions, namely low temperatures and rainfall.<ref name="Lefebvre & Seubert 1970"/> Programs in which baits were used poisoned to reduce icteride concentrations in late summer have been unsuccessful. While thousands of birds have occasionally died, the effect on large roosting-associated flocks that sometimes contain more than a million individuals is small; In addition, specimens of other species frequently die. The use of large lure traps, which often catch hundreds of birds per day, is also ineffective against these large flocks.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/>
===Use of 4-aminopyridine===
4-Aminopyridine is applied to one in one hundred particles of ground corn used as bait. Generally, corn is thrown into the fields from planes that release a load of about 3.4 kg of bait per hectare on one third of the land. Because that amount of ground corn contains around 205,000 particles, approximately 2050 toxic particles are distributed per hectare treated.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/> The ingestion of one or more of these particles by an jaundice causes erratic flight, calls for suffering and finally death; that behavior often leads the remaining birds in the flock to leave the field.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/><ref name=jstor3799716></ref><ref name=jstor3799961></ref> The chemist DRC-1327, which has proven useful in mitigating damage to maturing corn, operates in the same way: when a bird ingests kernels from a partially hand-peeled cob to which the chemical has been applied with a sprayer manual, his erratic flight and his pre-death calls for suffering, which span a space of between five and fifteen minutes, chase away flocks from the fields.<ref name="De Grazio 1964"/>
The initial application of 4-aminopyridine should be carried out as soon as possible after the start of the milky stage of the grain ripening process. Two other booster applications five to seven days apart are generally recommended; Often just one is sufficient, but under conditions of prolonged bird activity more than three applications may be required at shorter intervals.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/> In Brown County (Northeast South Dakota), in 1965, hand-spread 4-aminopyridine baits at intervals of about one week reduced projected red-winged blackbird loss by maturing corn crops by 85%. The distressing behavior exhibited by the individuals affected by the chemical produced a marked fear response in other members of the flocks and the fields were free of sergeant thrushes even when the estimated directly affected proportion was less than 1%.<ref></ref> It has even been suggested that the continued use of 4-aminopyridine over the years could cause a change in the pattern of migration to the south, as if birds were learning to avoid areas persistently treated with the chemical.<ref name=jstor3799961/>
In another experiment in the same county, the number of jaundices making use of the treated area fell dramatically over a period of five days after treatment had begun and remained low for the remainder of the season of damage to cornfields. The results of this method were largely limited to icterides. Although common pheasant were abundant , there was no evidence that any were affected, and mortality among other bird species was negligible.<ref name=jstor3799716/>
The abundance of weeds should be considered as restricting the chances that birds will find bait particles scattered on the ground, so the use of this chemical must be accompanied by a weed control program. A less obvious problem is that of the insects that remove the bait. If Gryllus are detected in a field, ground corn is expected to disappear quickly. Crickets generally select untreated particles and leave the toxic ones behind; however, the rapid decrease in the total volume of ground corn on the ground decreases the attractiveness of ground-level feeding for jaundices. Because cricket populations are difficult to control, more frequent applications or other bird control techniques may be desirable under these circumstances. A third problem is that of heavy rains, which cover the bait with soil or drag it into cracks in the ground.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/> Likewise, a low population density of ichterides can reduce the effectiveness of its control with 4-aminopyridine.<ref name=jstor3799961/>
===Non-lethal methods===
A variety of devices to repel them, including electronic noise-making systems, helium balloons tied in the fields, radio-controlled aircraft, and various types of scarecrows are occasionally used in cornfields.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/> Methods such as scarecrows, pyrotechnics, and propane cannons, they help mitigate mild predation, but only work effectively if the duration of the damage period is less than that of the birds becoming accustomed to these methods. Sergeant thrus quickly become accustomed to them, particularly if the crop is a prime food source in an area with few alternative sources of livelihood.<ref name="Homan et al 2004"/> Although harvesting as early as possible after the corn has dried sufficiently can limit damage by northern grazing flocks, adjusting the harvest date does not help farmers reduce losses by sergeant thrushes during the milky stage.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/>
One approach that has been successful in controlling roosts in the highlands is dispersal of populations through habitat alteration or bird harassment. These procedures, carried out by biologists in cooperation with local citizens, have been successful in dispersing or displacing populations of up to one million individuals. Although this dispersion can sometimes move the problem from one place to another — especially when the area has been intensively cultivated with corn and alternative food sources are not abundant, it has often been effective in solving local problem situations. Because oats and wheat grains in already harvested fields constitute an important food for jaundices in late summer, the postponement of plowing the land with small grain stubble can lessen the pressure exerted by the predation of these birds on the maturing corn. The natural existence or planting of plants such as millet, sorghum (Sorghum spp.), Polygons (Polygonum spp.) And various grasses for example, mohas ( Setaria spp.) that could be beneficial. As a general ecological principle, diversity in the types of habitats that can be maintained in regions of intense agricultural activity is related to a greater probability that the damages caused by pests are restricted to economically tolerable levels.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/>
Studies in sweet corn fields indicate that jaundices could often be initially attracted to maturing crops by insects.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/><ref name=Dolbeer2008/> Flocks can wander the land cultivated for about a week consuming insects and weed seeds before attacking the corn. Diabrotica beetles may be especially attractive during this period. Thus the birds become habituated to feeding in the fields and quickly move from insects to corn when it enters the vulnerable milky stage. Experiments in which insect populations in sweet corn crops were treated with insecticides during the week before the grain entered the milky phase, they showed that fewer birds visited these fields and less damage was recorded to the corn in the subsequent vulnerability period than in nearby untreated land. It is probable that the abundance of weeds in cornfields also increases their attractiveness to ichterids and their control would lead to a decrease in the losses produced by these birds.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/>
===Chemical sterilization===
An alternative way to reduce populations of sergeant thrush, and therefore the damage they cause to crops, involves implementing a program that is intended to interfere with their ability to reproduce, for example, through the use of sterilizing chemicals. Due to the polygynous nature of the species, it has been suggested that such a program could become more effective if directed at males. However, the incidence of promiscuity would imply that chemical sterilization of a certain fraction of males from a local population would not result in a proportional decrease in fertile clutches.<ref name=jstor4160617></ref>
The effects of this method would probably vary according to the type of habitat in which the treated males have established their territories. In general, there should be a higher proportion of fertile clutches in those densely populated habitats and with a greater number of renidifications. Renidifications are more common in swamps than in the highlands. In turn, individuals that reproduce in the highlands probably feed more often within their own territories than those that reproduce in swamps, which probably makes promiscuity difficult in the first type of habitat. Thus, chemical sterilization could be more effective among upland populations than among swamp populations.<ref name=jstor4160617/>
Sterilizing chemicals may reduce the number of chicks produced by a successful nest somewhat. Since renidification clutches are significantly fewer in number than the original, even if a female that first mated with a sterile male then renidified and mated with a fertile male, perhaps she would produce fewer chicks than she would have had if her first clutch would have been fertile.<ref name=jstor4160617/>
The number of fertile clutches in a male's territory may be limited through the sterilization of that male, but the degree to which that number decreases will depend on the disposition of the neighboring fertile territorial males and perhaps also on the number of fertile non-territorial males. in the population. Studies with artificial eggs suggest that incubation of sterile eggs would be prolonged, 98 since females normally incubate artificial eggs for around 20 days.<ref name=jstor4160617/><ref></ref> An extended incubation of unviable eggs would result in fewer renidification attempts and, therefore, it decreased the opportunities to find a fertile mate for a female who originally mated with a sterile male.<ref name=jstor4160617/>
== Relationship with humans ==
In winter, the species forage away from marshes, taking seeds and grain from open fields and agricultural areas. It is sometimes considered an agricultural pest.<ref name = jaramillo/> Farmers have been known to use pesticides—such as parathion—in illegal attempts to control their populations.<ref></ref> In the United States, such efforts are illegal because no pesticide can be used on non-target organisms, or for any use not explicitly listed on the pesticide's label. However, the USDA has deliberately poisoned this species: in 2009, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service reported poisoning over 950,000 red-winged blackbirds in Texas and Louisiana.<ref></ref> This poisoning has been implicated as a potential cause of the decline of the rusty blackbird, a once abundant species that has declined 99% since the 1960s and has been recently listed as Threatened on the IUCN Red List.<ref name=wells></ref>
Like English, the Indigenous languages of the bird's range describe it by its physical characteristics. In the Anishinaabe languages, an indigenous language group spoken throughout much of the bird's northeastern range, this bird's names are diverse. In the Oji-Cree language, the northernmost of the Anishinaabe languages, it is called jachakanoob, while the Ojibwa language spoken in Northwestern Ontario and into Manitoba ranging immediately south of the Oji-Cree's range, the bird is called jachakanoo (with the cognates cahcahkaniw (Swampy Cree), cahcahkaluw (coastal Southern East Cree), cahcahkayuw (inland Southern East Cree), cahcahkayow (Plains Cree); the northern Algonquian languages classify the red-winged blackbird as a type of a junco or grackle, deriving the bird's name from their word for "spotted" or "marked". In the vast majority of the other Ojibwa language dialects, the bird is called memiskondinimaanganeshiinh, literally meaning "a bird with a very red damn-little shoulder-blade". However, in the Odawa language, an Anishinaabe language in southwestern Ontario and in Michigan, the bird is instead called either memeskoniinisi ("bird with a red patch on its wing") or memiskonigwiigaans ("bird with a wing of small and very red patch").<ref></ref> In N'syilxcn (Colville-Okanagan, Interior Salish language) the bird is known as ƛ̓kƛ̓aʕkək.<ref></ref> In the Hoocąk language they are known as cooxją́ aporošucra, which describes the round red spot on its wing as well as identifying it as a blackbird. <ref> Rev. James Owen Dorsey, Winnebago-English Vocabulary and Winnebago Verbal Notes, 4800 Dorsey Papers: Winnebago (3.3.2) 321 old no. 1226 (Washington: Smithsonian Institution, National Anthropological Archives, 1888) 82 pp. </ref>
In the Great Plains, the Lakota language, another Indigenous language spoken throughout much of the bird's range, the bird is called wabloša ("wings of red"). Its songs are described in Lakota as tōke, mat'ā nī ("oh! that I might die"), as nakun miyē (".and me"), as miš eyā ("me too!"), and as cap'cehlī ("a beaver's running sore").<ref>Buechel, Eugene and Manhard, Paul (2002).

== Conservation status ==
It is a species of least concern.<ref name=BirdLife2013/><ref name=allaboutbirds/> A being one of the largest and most widely distributed birds in North America, little has been done to protect it from the effects of habitat destruction and urbanization. It can survive in a wide range of environments, many populations manage to overcome the loss of natural habitats. However, sergeant thrushes thrive in wetland areas and with the destruction of natural wetlands their population is likely to shrink.<ref name=animaldiversity/> The species is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act 1918, a formal treaty between the United States and Canada that was later expanded to include Mexico. This law gives them legal protection in the United States, but they can be killed "when they are found preying or about to prey on ornamental trees or trees planted for shade, crops, livestock or wildlife."<ref name=Dolbeer2002/>
A study in Illinois indicated that red-winged blackbird populations doubled between 1908 and 1958. It had traditionally reproduced in wetlands, with Ohio primarily inhabiting swamps associated with lakes and rivers.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/> During the 20th century, however, it adapted to man-made habitat changes and now often nests in hayfields, along roads and ditches, and elsewhere in the highlands.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/><ref name=pmid16191645/>
Despite its successful adaptation to changes in practices related to land use, populations of red-winged blackbird have reduced the width of its range during the second half of the twentieth century,<ref name="Homan et al 2004"/><ref name=Dolbeer2002/> and Changes in the abundance and adequacy of grasslands have been implicated in this.<ref name="Homan et al 2004"/> In Ohio, the sergeant thrush was negatively affected between 1966 and 1996 by the decrease in hay production, the earlier harvest of hay and the increase in crops planted in furrows, a situation homologous to that suffered by other species of birds from less numerous grasslands. Although the negative effect of the increased efficiency and the diminishing diversity of modern agricultural practices on the populations of sergeant thrush in this state may be perceived as a positive event by the producers of corn and sunflower, the agricultural practices that have precipitated the numerical decline of this species may have caused more severe repercussions for birds from less common grasslands, such as the Upland sandpiper and the Grasshopper sparrow.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/>
In the late 1970s, Ohio hosted the highest density of blackbirds sergeant during the breeding season among all US states and Canadian provinces,<ref name=Dolbeer2002/> However, between 1966 and 1996, the reproductive populations in this state showed a marked decrease. Decreasing the area under hay other than alfalfa between those same years was likely to reduce the availability of quality nesting habitats. Likewise, corn even though it attracts insects that sergeant thrushes consume and despite the fact that their grains represent in themselves an energy source and soybeans which do not constitute a food source for the species, which together made up 1966 to 1996, an average of 70% of the cultivated area in Ohio, do not provide adequate nesting habitat. In turn, the large annual fluctuations in the area cultivated with hay, both from one year to the next and within the same year of a certain reproductive season,<ref name=Dolbeer2002/> Similarly, in Ontario between 1974 and 1995, the average size of harems in a given year was positively related to hay production from the previous year, although the percentage variation in the size of harems from one season to the next the following was not linearly related to the annual percentage change in hay production; Hay production declined during this period and the size of the harems decreased from approximately three females per male to 1.6 females.<ref name=pmid16191645/>
In addition in Ontario, a negative relationship was found between the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAO) in the six months prior to a certain reproductive season and the size of the harems. If winter mortality contributes to the decrease in the size of the harems, the annual variations in their size should be related to the annual changes in the rates of return of marked territorial males. Variations in the size of harems and male return rates per year were indeed found to be positively correlated. Although not as pronounced, the relationship between male return rates and winter NAO values was similar to that between changes in harem size and NAO.<ref name=pmid16191645/>
On the other hand, in southwestern Quebec, red-winged blackbird populations doubled between 1966 and 1981, apparently in response to the development of maize production. The increased availability of residual grains in spring and summer. the reproductive season will probably play a fundamental role in the growth of this bird's population.<ref name="Clark et al 1986"/> Likewise, in the mid-1990s, the reproductive population of North Dakota which at least between 1994 and 2002 was at the forefront among all the American states and Canadian provinces in terms of population density of this species began to increase rapidly.<ref name="Homan et al 2004"/>

During the breeding season, the approximately 8 million sergeant thrush nesting in Ohio and their chicks probably consume more than 5.4 million kg of insects, an average of almost 53 kg / km². Many of these insects, such as the weevils (Hypera spp.), Come from alfalfa fields, pastures, oat fields and other crops. In cornfields, jaundices often feed on corn worms (Helicoverpa zea) and beetles of the genus Diabrotica. In early spring, sergeant thrushes consume corn borers (Ostrinia nubilalis) in fields with corn stubble.<ref name=Dolbeer2002/> However, Bendell et al. (1981) found that the economic benefit of pest control , such as larvae of that lepidopteran, by the red-winged blackbird only compensated for 20% of the damage to crops caused by this bird.<ref name="auto10"></ref><ref></ref>
