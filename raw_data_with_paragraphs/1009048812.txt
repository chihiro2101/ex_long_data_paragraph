Centre Point

==Construction and history==
The building was designed by George Marsh of the architects Richard Seifert,<ref name="Pevsner"></ref><ref></ref> with engineers Pell Frischmann, and was constructed by George Wimpey from 1963 to 1966<ref> </ref><ref name="EH listing" /> for £5.5 million.<ref name="Almacantar"> urltoken Almacantar.</ref> The precast segments were formed of fine concrete, utilising crushed Portland stone; they were made by Portcrete Limited at Portland, Isle of Portland, Dorset, and transported to London by lorry.<ref>Stuart Morris, Portland; an Illustrated History, The Dovecote Press.</ref>
Centre Point was built as speculative office space by property tycoon Harry Hyams, who had leased the site at £18,500 a year for 150 years. Hyams intended that the whole building be occupied by a single tenant, and negotiated fiercely for its approval.<ref></ref>
On completion, the building remained vacant for many years, leading to its being referred to as "London's Empty Skyscraper".<ref name=urban75> urltoken Centre Point Tower, London: An architectural icon from the 1960s, London Landmarks, Urban75, April 2012.</ref> With property prices rising and most business tenancies taken for set periods of 10 or 15 years, Hyams could afford to keep it empty and wait for his single tenant at the asking price of £1,250,000; he was challenged to allow tenants to rent single floors, but consistently refused. At that time skyscrapers were rare in London, and Centre Point's prominence led to its becoming a rallying symbol for opponents.<ref name=urban75/> The homeless charity Centrepoint was founded in 1969 as a homeless shelter in nearby Soho, named Centrepoint in response to the building Centre Point being seen as an "affront to the homeless" for being left empty to make money for the property developer.<ref name="charity"></ref>
In 1974 an umbrella group of Direct Action housing campaigners, including Jim Radford, Ron Bailey and Jack Dromey, organised a weekend squatting of Centre Point from 18 January to 20 January to draw attention to its being deliberately left empty during a housing crisis in London. (Two of the occupiers had obtained jobs with the Burns Security Company, which was guarding the building.)<ref>Edward Platt, urltoken "Hot air over an office block: It's 25 years since the protests over Centre Point. Not much has changed", The Independent, 16 January 1999.</ref>
From July 1980 to March 2014, Centre Point was the headquarters of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) which became, at 33 years and seven months, the building's longest-standing tenant.<ref name="Targetfollow news archive, 11/08/09"/>
In October 2005, Centre Point was bought from the previous owners, Blackmoor LP, by commercial property firm Targetfollow for £85 million.<ref name="Targetfollow news archive, 06/10/05"/> The building was extensively refurbished. occupants included US talent agency William Morris; the state-owned national oil company of Saudi Arabia, Aramco; Chinese oil company Petrochina; and electronic gaming company EA Games.<ref name="Targetfollow news archive, 11/08/09"/>
It has since been purchased by Almacantar. Almacantar approached Conran and Partners for the refurbishment of the tower including change of use from office to residential, whilst MICA, formerly Rick Mather Architects, lead the refurbishment of the lower rise buildings and the new affordable housing block. In 2015 work began on conversion of the building to residential flats.<ref>Hilary Osborne, urltoken "Work begins on luxury flat conversion of London landmark Centre Point", The Guardian, 26 January 2015.</ref> The restoration and conversion of the tower to a residential building was finished in March 2018.<ref></ref>
==Transport==
The promised transport interchange and highways improvements were not delivered following the original plan. The pedestrian subway attracted anti-social activities.<ref name=urban75/> On 19 June 2006, the CABE pointed to the building as an example of bad design, where badly-designed pavements force pedestrians into the bus lane and account for the highest level of pedestrian injuries in Central London. With the planned redevelopment of Tottenham Court Road Underground Station, a framework has been adopted to redevelop the traffic island beneath Centre Point as an open space.<ref> urltoken "Work starts on public plaza beneath Richard Seifert's Centre Point", De Zeen, 27 January 2015.</ref> The site of the plaza and fountains will be a work site for the Crossrail and station expansion works. The plaza is being demolished and the fountains have been removed.
==Architectural reception==
Architecture critic Nikolaus Pevsner described Centre Point as "coarse in the extreme".<ref name="Pevsner" /> In 1995 it became a Grade II listed building. In 2009, it won the Concrete Society's Mature Structures Award.<ref> urltoken 43rd Concrete Society Awards.</ref>

* Centre Point is one of the locations Jim (Cillian Murphy) walks past in the "deserted London" scenes of UK horror film 28 Days Later (2002). Director Danny Boyle also references it (as "'Centre Point,' the famous empty/partially empty building in this busy section of London") on the DVD commentary.<ref></ref>
* The character "Old Bailey" camps on top of Centre Point at one point in Neil Gaiman's novel Neverwhere. He describes it as an "ugly and distinctive Sixties skyscraper" and goes on to remark that "the view from the top was without compare, and, furthermore, the top of Centre Point was one of the few places in the West End of London where you did not have to look at Centre Point itself".<ref></ref>
* The building is mentioned in the sixth episode of the BBC comedy series The Thick of It. During an inquiry into the UK government's routine News leak, Stuart Pearson, a Conservative spin doctor, is asked about an analogy he has made between government transparency and the Pompidou Centre. A member of the inquiry suggests that rather than creating a "political Pompidou Centre," Pearson has created "the opposite, Centre Point – I mean everyone sees it looming over them but nobody has the faintest idea what happens in there." To which Pearson replies, "I think there's some kind of club on the top floor."<ref></ref>
