Manchester City F.C.

== Ownership and finances ==
The holding company of Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Limited, is a private limited company, with approximately 54 million shares in issue. The club has been in private hands since 2007, when the major shareholders agreed to sell their holdings to UK Sports Investments Limited (UKSIL), a company controlled by former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. UKSIL then made a formal offer to buy the shares held by several thousand small shareholders.
Prior to the Thaksin takeover, the club was listed on the specialist independent equity market PLUS (formerly OFEX),<ref name="PLUS"></ref> where it had been listed since 1995. On 6 July 2007, having acquired 75% of the shares, Thaksin de-listed the club and re-registered it as a private company.<ref></ref> By August UKSIL had acquired over 90% of the shares, and exercised its rights under the Companies Act to "squeeze out" the remaining shareholders, and acquire the entire shareholding. Thaksin Shinawatra became chairman of the club and two of Thaksin's children, Pintongta and Oak Chinnawat also became directors. Former chairman John Wardle stayed on the board for a year, but resigned in July 2008 following Nike executive Garry Cook's appointment as executive chairman in May.<ref></ref> The club made a pre-tax loss of £11m in the year ending 31 May 2007, the final year for which accounts were published as a public company.<ref></ref>
Thaksin's purchase prompted a period of transfer spending at the club,<ref></ref> spending in around £30&nbsp;million,<ref></ref> whereas over the previous few seasons net spending had been among the lowest in the division. A year later, this investment was itself dwarfed by larger sums. On 1 September 2008, Abu Dhabi-based Abu Dhabi United Group completed a takeover of Manchester City. The deal, worth a reported £200&nbsp;million, was announced on the morning of 1 September. It sparked various transfer "deadline-day" rumours and bids such as the club's attempt to gazump Manchester United's protracted bid to sign Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in excess of £30&nbsp;million.<ref>
</ref><ref>
</ref>
Minutes before the transfer window closed, the club signed Robinho from Real Madrid for a British record transfer fee of £32.5&nbsp;million.<ref>
</ref>
The wealth of the new owners meant that in the summer of 2009, the club was able to finance the purchase of several experienced international players prior to the new season, spending more than any other club in the Premier League.<ref>

== Stadium ==
The City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester, known as the Etihad Stadium since 2011 for sponsorship reasons, is on a 200-year lease from Manchester City Council. It has been City's home since the end of the 2002–03 season, when the club moved from Maine Road.<ref></ref> Before moving to the stadium, Manchester City spent in excess of £30&nbsp;million to convert it to football use. The pitch was lowered, adding another tier of seating around it, and a new North Stand built.<ref>James, Manchester: A Football History, p391.</ref> The inaugural match at the new stadium was a 2–1 win over Barcelona in a friendly match.<ref></ref> A 7,000-seat third tier on the South Stand was completed in time for the start of the 2015–16 football season. Current capacity stands at 55,097. A North Stand third tier has planning approval and work on it is expected to begin by 2017, increasing capacity to around 61,000.<ref></ref>
After playing home matches at five stadiums between 1880 and 1887, the club settled at Hyde Road Football Stadium, its home for 36 years.<ref>Inglis, The Football Grounds of Great Britain, p62</ref> A fire destroyed the Main Stand in 1920, and the club moved to the 84,000 capacity Maine Road three years later. Maine Road, nicknamed the "Wembley of the North" by its designers, hosted the largest-ever crowd at an English club ground when 84,569 attended an FA Cup tie against Stoke City on 3 March 1934.<ref></ref> Though Maine Road was redeveloped several times over its 80-year lifespan, by 1995 its capacity was restricted to 32,000, prompting the search for a new ground which culminated in the move to the City of Manchester Stadium in 2003. The stadium was renamed the Etihad Stadium in 2011.<ref></ref>
== Honours ==
Based on trophy count, Manchester City are one of the most successful teams in England – their twenty-six major domestic and European honours make them tied for fifth with Tottenham Hotspur F.C. on the list of most decorated sides in England.
The club's first major trophy was the 1904 FA Cup,<ref></ref> though they had previously won three Manchester Cups before that point.<ref></ref> Their first top division league title came in the 1936–37 season,<ref name="mcfcoffhist"/> with the first Community Shield won in the following August.<ref name="mcfcoffhist"/> Their first EFL Cup and European trophy both came at the end of the 1969–70 season, the two trophies also constituting their first trophy double.<ref name="mcfcoffhist"/> In 2018–19 Manchester City became the first team to claim all of the major English trophies available in a single season, winning not just the Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup but also the Community Shield.<ref></ref>
1970 Cup Winners' Cup victory remains City's only European trophy to date. They reached the semi-final of the Champions League once, in 2016.
Manchester City jointly hold the record for most second division titles with Leicester City, both clubs having won the league on seven occasions.<ref></ref> Their first victory was in 1898–99, and the most recent in 2001–02.<ref name="mcfcoffhist"/>

== Controversy ==
=== Sexual abuse scandal ===
In late 2016, allegations of sexual abuse of young players at Manchester City were made due to the club's association with Barry Bennell (also at Crewe Alexandra and previously convicted of sexual abuse offences in the UK and US)<ref name="BBC-23Nov2016"></ref> and about another coach<ref></ref> (later named as Frank Roper) at the Nova feeder club.<ref name="Roper-01Dec2016"></ref> On 25 November, two further youth players, Jason Dunford<ref name="Dunford-25Nov2016"></ref> and Chris Unsworth, also alleged sexual abuse by Bennell, initially at a Manchester City nursery team;<ref name="Cacciottolo-25Nov2016"></ref> Dunford also later spoke of abuse by Roper.<ref name="Roper-01Dec2016"/> (In February 2018, it was revealed that three former Manchester City players had lodged civil cases against the club in March 2016 after allegedly becoming victims of Bennell.)<ref name="Keeling-07Feb2018"></ref>
In February 2018 Bennell was sentenced for a total of 50 offences against 12 boys,<ref name="BBC-15Feb2018"></ref> and jailed for 31 years.<ref name="BBC-19Feb2018"></ref><ref name="Taylor-19Feb2018"></ref> After the guilty verdicts, Unsworth read a statement outside Liverpool Crown Court;<ref name="BBC-15Feb2018"/><ref name="Gstaff-15Feb2018"></ref> another victim, Gary Cliffe, waived his anonymity to speak about the abuse he had experienced, aged 11 to 15, from Bennell while at Manchester City.<ref name="Taylor-15Feb2018"></ref> The club offered its "heartfelt sympathy to all victims for the unimaginably traumatic experiences they have endured", and said an internal review had identified serious allegations of child sex abuse in respect of a second man, John Broome<ref name="BBC-Broome-15Feb2018"></ref> (now dead), with "potential historic connections to the club".<ref name="BBC-15Feb2018"/>
Manchester City opened an investigation regarding Bennell's association with the club in the 1980s;<ref name="Cacciottolo-25Nov2016" /> in May 2017, this was being led by Jane Mulcahy QC.<ref name="Taylor-15May2017"></ref> In March 2019, Manchester City announced it had created a compensation fund for victims of historical child sexual abuse at the club. It was aware of 40 potential claimants (with more expected to come forward), and regarded the civil redress scheme as a preferable alternative to victims pursuing civil claims through the courts.<ref name="Roan-12Mar2019"></ref> In May 2020, it was reported that eight men sexually abused by Barry Bennell were pursuing damages claims against Manchester City (two were also bringing claims against Crewe Alexandra), and all eight claims are set to be heard together at an eight-week trial listed to start in October 2021.<ref name="BBC-05May2020"></ref>

</ref> Under managers Pep Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp, the rivalry obtained its current significance in the 2018-19 season, in which Man City beat Liverpool to the Premier League title by a single point. In a 2019 survey, City fans answered that Liverpool, not Manchester United, are the club's biggest rivals,<ref></ref> although compared to the Manchester derby, the rivalry has little to no historical significance. Man City also have local rivalries<ref></ref> with Bolton Wanderers, Oldham Athletic, and Stockport County, and with Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea in the Premier League.<ref></ref>
In the late 1980s, City fans started a craze of bringing inflatable objects to matches, primarily oversized bananas. One disputed explanation for the craze is that in a match against West Bromwich Albion chants from fans calling for the introduction of Imre Varadi as a substitute mutated into "Imre Banana". Terraces packed with inflatable-waving supporters became a frequent sight in the 1988–89 season as the craze spread to other clubs (inflatable fish were seen at Grimsby Town), with the phenomenon reaching a peak at City's match at Stoke City on 26 December 1988, a match declared by fanzines as a fancy dress party.<ref></ref> In 2010, City supporters adopted an exuberant dance, dubbed The Poznań, from fans of Polish club Lech Poznań.<ref></ref>
