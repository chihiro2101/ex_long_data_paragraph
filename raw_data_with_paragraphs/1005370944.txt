Pedestrian crossing

==History==
Pedestrian crossings already existed more than 2000 years ago, as can be seen in the ruins of Pompeii. Blocks raised on the road allowed pedestrians to cross the street without having to step onto the road itself which doubled up as Pompeii's drainage and sewage disposal system. The spaces between the blocks allowed horse-drawn carts to pass along the road.<ref></ref>
The first pedestrian crossing signal was erected in Bridge Street, Westminster, London, in December 1868. It was the idea of John Peake Knight, a railway engineer, who thought that it would provide a means to safely allow pedestrians to cross this busy thoroughfare. The signal consisted of a semaphore arm (manufactured by Saxby and Farmer, who were railway signaling makers), which was raised and lowered manually by a police constable who would rotate a handle on the side of the pole. The semaphore arms were augmented by gas illuminated lights at the top (green and red) to increase visibility of the signal at night. However, in January 1869, the gas used to illuminate the lights at the top leaked and caused an explosion, injuring the police operator. No further work was done on signalled pedestrian crossings until fifty years later.<ref></ref>
In the early 20th century, car traffic increased dramatically. A reader of The Times wrote to the editor in 1911:
<blockquote>"Could you do something to help the pedestrian to recover the old margin of safety on our common streets and roads? It is heartrending to read of the fearful deaths taking place. If a pedestrian now has even one hesitation or failure the chance of escape from a dreadful death is now much less than when all vehicles were much slower. There is, too, in the motor traffic an evident desire not to slow down before the last moment. It is surely a scandal that on the common ways there should be undue apprehension in the minds of the weakest users of them. While the streets and roads are for all, of necessity the pedestrians, and the feeblest of these, should receive the supreme consideration."<ref>The Times, 14 Feb. 1911, pg. 14: The Pedestrian's Chances.</ref></blockquote>
According to Zegeer,
<blockquote>"Pedestrians have a right to cross roads safely and, therefore, planners and engineers have a professional responsibility to plan, design, and install safe crossing facilities."<ref name="nevadadot.com"></ref></blockquote>
==Installation criteria==
Some Countries have specific criteria to provide pedestrian facilities; for example, they provide warrants, depending on local conditions, usually prioritized as follows:
 
a) Do nothing.
In most places, the pedestrian does not need specific facilities, as in low car flow streets, the pedestrians can cross (without priority) at any location.
b) providing central islands in the road.
Provides the pedestrian with a safe place to wait at the middle of the road and advance as conditions permit.
c) Central reservation. 
A continuous (Usually raised) central reservation promotes safe pedestrian crossing in all the area, and reduce vehicle speed and head-on crash.
d) Zebra crossing.
Provides a crossing in a low pedestrians flow area, if the pedestrian flow is high (as outside a school, train or bus terminal) the vehicle traffic will be severally affected by a significant number of pedestrians using the crossing, making necessary to provide traffic signals.
e) Traffic signals (Pelican in the U.K.).
Used to control vehicle-pedestrian conflicts, not in intersections, and provided with pedestrians buttons. In this way, the vehicle signal turns red only if a pedestrian is trying to cross.
g) A staggered traffic signal.
If the road is wide, (two or more traffic lines per traffic direction) and a central reservation exists or can be provided, traffic signals can be installed in a not aligned pair. This design permits to provide staggered green time for pedestrians (one side can be green while the other is red), The pedestrian needs to wait in the central reservation for the second crossing, improving the possibility to coordinate vehicle traffic between intersection, with a reduction of stops, fuel consumption, and reduced car emissions.
h) Pedestrian signal in the intersection.
This facility is added in an intersection with a traffic signal, giving a clear orientation to a pedestrian when it is possible to cross. In some countries, is provision is obligatory in all traffic signals.
i) Pedestrian overpass or underpass.
This facility eliminates the conflict between vehicular traffic and pedestrian, but need to be supported by some form of physical restriction preventing pedestrians from crossing at level, as they perceived the additional effort to climb the overpass.
==Design and layout==
In some countries, including the US, "unmarked crosswalks" are presumed to occur at intersections even if a crossing isn't marked, except at locations where pedestrian crossing is expressly prohibited.<ref name="row-xwalk50" />
The simplest marked crossings may just consist of some markings on the road surface. In the US these are known as "marked crosswalks."<ref name="row-xwalk50" /> In the UK these are often called zebra crossings, referring to the alternate white and black stripes painted on the road surface.<ref name="Trafford Council"></ref> If the pedestrian has priority over vehicular traffic when using the crossing, then they have an incentive to use the crossing instead of crossing the road at other places. In some countries, pedestrians may not have priority, but may be committing an offence if they cross the road elsewhere, or "jaywalk." Special markings are often made on the road surface, both to direct pedestrians and to prevent motorists from stopping vehicles in the way of foot traffic. There are many varieties of signal and marking layouts around the world and even within single countries. In the United States, there are many inconsistencies, although the variations are usually minor. There are several distinct types in the United Kingdom, each with their own name.
Some crossings have pedestrian traffic signals that allow pedestrians and road traffic to use the crossing alternately. On some traffic signals, pressing a call button is required to trigger the signal.<ref name="buttons nyt" /><ref name="buttons bbc" /> Audible or tactile signals may also be included to assist people who have poor sight.<ref name="mutcd-4e" /> In many cities, some or most signals are equipped with countdown timers to give notice to both drivers and pedestrians the time remaining on the crossing signal.<ref name="mutcd-4e" /> In places where there is very high pedestrian traffic, Embedded pavement flashing-light systems are used to signal traffic of pedestrian presence, or pedestrian scramble (also known as Barnes Dances) may be used, which stop vehicular traffic in all directions at the same time.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
===Footbridges and tunnels===
Footbridges or pedestrian tunnels may be used in lieu of crosswalks at very busy intersections as well as at locations where limited-access roads and controlled-access highways must be crossed. They can also be beneficial in locations where the sidewalk or pedestrian path naturally ascends or descends to a different level than the intersection itself, and the natural "desire line" leads to a footbridge or tunnel, respectively.<ref name="Wetmore 2012"/> However, pedestrian bridges are ineffective in most locations; due to their expense, they are typically spaced far apart. Additionally, ramps, stairs, or elevators present additional obstacles, and pedestrians tend to use an at-grade pedestrian crossing instead, sometimes jaywalking to avoid these obstacles.<ref name="Wetmore 2012"></ref> A variation on the bridge concept, often called a skyway or skywalk, is sometimes implemented in regions that experience inclement weather.
===Pedestrian scramble===
Some intersections display red lights in all directions for a period of time. Known as a pedestrian scramble, this type of vehicle all-way stop allows pedestrians to cross safely in any direction, including diagonally.
===Crosswalk shortening===
Pedestrian refuges or small islands in the middle of a street may be added when a street is very wide, as these crossings can be too long for some individuals to cross in one cycle.<ref name="Officials Initiative 2016 p. 88"></ref> These pedestrian refuges may consist of building new concrete traffic islands in the middle of the road; extending an existing island or median strip to the crosswalk to provide a refuge; or simply cutting through the existing island or median strip where the median is already continuous.<ref name="Officials Initiative 2016 p. 88"/>
Another relatively widespread variation is the curb extension (also known as a bulb-out), which narrows the width of the street and is used in combination with crosswalk markings. They can also be used to slow down cars, potentially creating a safer crossing for pedestrians.<ref></ref>
===Crosswalk striping===
Road marking machine are special equipment professionally used to paint zebra lines on the intersections or other busy road sections. Because of the characteristics of zebra crossings, parallel stripes that are wide but not long, the striping machine is often a small hand-guided road marking machine, which can easily be made to change direction. There are differences between the engineering regulations in different countries. The marking shoe of a pedestrian cross striping machine, which determines marking lines' width, is much wider than on other marking machines. A smaller marking shoe with wheels may be used to perform the road striping.
The section of road should be swept clean and kept dry. The painter first pulls a guiding line straight and fix the two ends on the ground. Then they spray or brush a primer layer on the asphalt or concrete surface. The thermoplastic paint in powder form is then melted into a molten liquid state for painting. Finally, the painter pulls or pushes the striping machine with the guide rod along the guiding line. As an alternative to thermoplastics, household paint or epoxy can be used to mark crosswalks.<ref></ref>
===Crosswalks as artwork===
Some crosswalks include unique designs, many of which take the form of artwork. These works of art may serve many different purposes, such as attracting tourism or catching drivers' attention.<ref name="Perry 2016"></ref>
Cities and towns worldwide have held competitions to paint crosswalks, usually as a form of artwork.<ref name="Perry 2016"/> In Santiago, a 2013 work by Canadian artist Roadsworth features yellow-and-blue fish overlaid on the existing crosswalk. Other crossings worldwide also feature some of Roadsworth's work,<ref></ref> including a crosswalk in Montreal where the zebra stripes are shaped like bullets, as well as "conveyor belt" crosswalk in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.<ref name="Perry 2016"/> In Lompoc, California, several artists were commissioned to create an artwork as part of its "Creative Crossings" competition. Artist Marlee Bedford painted the first set of four crosswalks as part of the 2015 competition,<ref></ref> and Linda Powers painted two more crosswalks in 2016 following that year's competition.<ref></ref>
In Tbilisi, some Tbilisi Academy of Arts students and government officials jointly created a crossing that is designed to look like it is in 3D. A message on the white bars of the crosswalk reads, "for your safety."<ref name="Perry 2016"/><ref></ref> 3D crosswalk designs have also been installed in China, with a "floating zebra crossing" implemented in a village in Luoyuan County to boost tourism;<ref name="Perry 2016"/> a multicolored 3-D crossing installed in Changsha to catch drivers' attention;<ref></ref> and another multicolored crossing in Sichuan that serves the same purpose as the colored Changsha crosswalk.<ref name="WebUrbanist 2012"></ref>
Colored crosswalks might have themes that reflect the immediate area. For instance, Chengdu had a red-and-white zebra crossing with hearts painted on it, reflecting its location near a junction of two rivers.<ref></ref><ref name="Perry 2016"/><ref name="WebUrbanist 2012"/> In Curitiba, a crosswalk with its bars irregularly painted like a barcode served as an advertisement for a nearby shopping center, but was later painted over.<ref name="WebUrbanist 2012"/> A pedestrian scramble in the Chinatown section of Oakland, California, is painted with red-and-yellow colors to signify the colors of the flag of China.<ref name="WebUrbanist 2012"/><ref></ref>
Sometimes, different cities around the world may have similar art concepts for their crosswalks. Rainbow flag-colored crosswalks, which are usually painted to show support for the locality's LGBT cultures, have been installed in San Francisco;<ref></ref><ref name="Perry 2016"/> West Hollywood;<ref></ref> Philadelphia;<ref></ref> and Tel Aviv.<ref></ref><ref name="Perry 2016"/> Crosswalks painted like piano keyboards have been painted in Long Beach;<ref></ref> Warsaw;<ref name="Perry 2016"/><ref name="WebUrbanist 2012"/> and Chongqing.<ref name="Perry 2016"/>
The United States Federal Highway Administration prohibits crosswalk art due to concerns about safety and visibility, but U.S. cities have chosen to install their own designs. Seattle had 40 crosswalks with unique designs, including the rainbow flag in Capitol Hill and the Pan-African flag in the Central District.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
==Distinctions by region==
===North America===
For crosswalk safety, in the USA there is not much clarity regarding the need for a crosswalk to be marked or unmarked dues to advantages and disadvantages of both approaches, although each city might have its own rules.<ref name="nevadadot.com" />
==== Marked crosswalks ====
Marked crosswalks are usually placed at traffic intersections or crossroads, but are occasionally used at mid-block locations where pedestrian generators are present such as at transit stops, schools, retail, or housing destinations. In the United States, these "mid-block crossings" may include additional regulatory signage such as "PED XING" (for "pedestrian crossing"), flashing yellow beacons, stop or yield signs, or by actuated or automatic signals.<ref name=":5" /> Some more innovative crossing treatments include in-pavement flashers, yellow flashing warning lights installed in the roadway, or HAWK beacon—an overhead signal with a pair of red beacons above an amber beacon, when a pedestrian is detected or actuates the device it begins a sequence of amber flashing followed by a solid red, followed by a flashing red phase that allows motorists to proceed, only if the pedestrian(s) are clear of the travel way.<ref></ref>
In the United States, crossing laws vary from state to state and sometimes at the local level. All states require vehicles to yield to a pedestrian who has entered a marked crosswalk.<ref name="row-xwalk50"></ref> Legally speaking, in most states crosswalks exist at all intersections meeting at approximately right angles, whether they are marked or not.<ref>See urltoken here (discussing the Uniform Vehicle Code and stating that "a crosswalk at an intersection is defined as the extension of the sidewalk or the shoulder across the intersection, regardless of whether it is marked or not."); see also California Vehicle Code section 275(a) ("'Crosswalk' is . . . that portion of a roadway included within the extension of the boundary lines of sidewalks at intersections where the intersecting roadways meet at approximately right angles, except the extension of such lines from an alley across a street")</ref> All states except Maine and Michigan require vehicles to yield to a pedestrian who has entered an unmarked crosswalk.<ref name="row-xwalk50" /> To gain the right-of-way in some parts of Canada, however, the pedestrian holds out his hand in a position much like that used to Handshake, and steps off the curb. The province of Ontario enacted a law in 2016 that mandates that drivers and bicyclists come to a complete stop at pedestrian "crossovers"—ladder-style crosswalks that are sometimes designated with overhead signs or lights—as well as crosswalks with Crossing guard.<ref></ref>
==== Signalized intersections ====
At crossings controlled by signals, the most common variety is arranged like this: At each end of a crosswalk, the poles which hold the traffic lights also have white "walk" and Portland Orange "don't walk" signs.<ref name=":3"></ref> These particular colors are used in North America (excluding Quebec<ref></ref>) to provide conspicuity against the backdrop of red, yellow, and green traffic lights. As of the 2000 MUTCD, modern signals are mandated to use pictograms of an orange "upraised hand" and a white "walking man" rather than words;<ref name=":3" /> the hand/man display is the mandate as of the 2009 edition.<ref name="mutcd-4e" /> On pedestrian signals displaying text, "don't walk" is spelled without an apostrophe so that it fits easily on the sign.<ref></ref> Modern pedestrian signals can be incandescent, neon, fiber-optic, or LED, with the latter three displays typically utilizing less energy.<ref name=":4"></ref>
Regardless of whether pictograms or words are used, the MUTCD defines a steady "upraised hand" or "don't walk" signal as an indication that a pedestrian cannot enter the street in that signal's direction, while a steady "walking man" or "walk signal" indicates that pedestrians can start crossing the street toward that signal.<ref name="mutcd-4e" /> The upraised hand or "don't walk" signals begin to flash during the pedestrian clearance interval when the transition to "don't walk" is imminent.<ref name="mutcd-4e" /> This normally occurs several seconds before the light turns yellow, usually going solid orange when the traffic light turns yellow or red; however, the display can be turned into a steady hand or "don't walk" sign while the vehicular light is yellow, or while the vehicular signal is still displaying a green light.<ref></ref> In intersections with "leading pedestrian intervals," the upraised hand or "don't walk" sign will continue flashing as the vehicular lights turn red and the other crossing(s) in the intersection display a walking man or "walk" sign. The vehicular traffic is then stopped in all directions for a short period of time before cross traffic is allowed to proceed.<ref></ref> The 2009 MUTCD states that the flashing walking man or "walk" signals do not have meaning.<ref name="mutcd-4e" /> The "flashing walk" indication was formerly used to delineate "watch out for turning vehicles"<ref></ref> and is still in use in Washington, D.C.;<ref></ref> however, as of the 2003 MUTCD, this was replaced by an optional "animated eyes" indication within the pedestrian signal display,<ref name=":10" /><ref></ref> which was placed in the MUTCD following a study that recommended the usage of the "animated eyes" signal.<ref></ref>
A gridded "egg-crate visor" is customarily placed in front of the lights to shield them from the sun and increase their visibility, but such visors can also be vulnerable to snow or ice accumulation on the screens, which in turn could block the pedestrian display.<ref name=":4" /> Pedestrian signals can also use a triangular-prism-shaped "cutaway visor" or "cap visor" (so named because the pitch of the visor, is shaped like a baseball cap), which mainly covers the top of the signal and the tops of the left and right sides; or a more rectangular-shaped "tunnel visor", which fully covers the left, right, and top sides of the pedestrian display.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
In some cities in the US, other methods of pedestrian detection are being or have been tested, including infrared and microwave technology, as well as weight sensors built in at curbside.<ref></ref> A 2000 study of these detectors in Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Rochester found that the infrared and microwave technologies both helped reduce conflicts between pedestrians and turning vehicles, as well as pedestrians starting during the "don't walk" phase.<ref></ref><ref name=":11"></ref> Subsequent studies found that the efficacy of these sensors varied based on pedestrian traffic at the location where they were installed.<ref name=":11" />
On fully actuated signals, or semi-actuated traffic signals, pressing the button to cross a smaller side street will cause an "instant walk signal". In most states, drivers only have to wait until the pedestrian has finished crossing the half of the crosswalk that the driver is driving on, after which the driver may proceed. However, in some states (such as Utah<ref></ref>), if the driver is in a school zone with the lights flashing, the driver must wait until the entire crosswalk is clear before he may proceed.
Massachusetts allows an unusual indication variation for pedestrian movement. At signalized intersections without separate pedestrian signal heads, the traffic signals may be programmed to turn red in all directions, followed by a steady display of yellow lights simultaneously with the red indications. During this red-plus-yellow indication, the intersection is closed to vehicular traffic and pedestrians are given an "exclusive pedestrian interval", or a pedestrian scramble phase, in which they can cross any leg of the intersection, usually in whatever direction they choose.<ref name=ma-rmv-p82></ref> This replaces the extra pedestrian signal, but is in violation of the 2009 MUTCD.<ref name="mutcd-4e" /> This practice is obsolescent but it remains in the Commonwealth's driver's manual.<ref name=ma-rmv-p82/>
===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom and certain parts of the Commonwealth of Nations, animal names are often used to distinguish several types of such crossings. A zebra crossing consists of wide longitudinal stripes on road (perpendicular to the crossing route), with flashing amber Belisha beacons either side of the road. Pedestrians may cross at any time, while drivers must give way to pedestrians on the crossing. A pelican crossing is a signalised pedestrian-operated crossing. The motor traffic facing signals use a flashing amber instead of the conventional red and amber signal of the standard UK traffic signal sequence. A puffin crossing is signalised; however, unlike a pelican crossing which is a timed crossing, The puffin has sensors to detect people still on the crossing. The puffin also uses standard UK traffic signal sequence. A toucan crossing is used by bicycles as well as pedestrians, while a pegasus crossing is used by horse riders - hence having the button to operate the crossing higher up.
Zebra crossings are the only specific pedestrian crossing point that does not use light signals to control traffic movement. The other types of crossing use coloured pictogram lights, depending on the intended users of the crossing this will be a man, a bicycle or a horse.
===Mainland Europe===
In Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany and other European countries, 90% of pedestrian fatalities occur outside of pedestrian crossings. The highest rate is in the UK, which has fewer crossings than neighbouring European countries.<ref name="theaa.com"></ref>
Continental crossings do not have the refinements of British ones, but they still indicate a good place to cross.<ref name="theaa.com"/>
In Switzerland, zebra crossings are marked in yellow.<ref></ref>
In France, it is not mandatory that crosswalks exist. However, if there is one less than 50 meters (55 yards) away, pedestrians are obliged to use it.<ref>Code de la route, article R412-37</ref>

Some countries in Europe, have used the word pedestrian crossing in some treaties, for instance in the sentence "A vehicle shall not overtake another vehicle which is approaching a pedestrian crossing marked on the carriageway or signposted as such, or which is stopped immediately before the crossing, otherwise than at a speed low enough to enable it to stop immediately if a pedestrian is on the crossing." from the convention on road traffic.<ref name="unece.org convention road traffic"></ref>
Such convention also consider that 
* "pedestrians wishing to cross a carriageway shall not step on to it without exercising care; they shall use a pedestrian crossing whenever there is one nearby;" (§6.a)
* "At other pedestrian crossings, pedestrians shall not step on to the carriageway without taking the distance and speed of approaching vehicles into account." (§6.b iii)
* "to cross the carriageway elsewhere than at a pedestrian crossing signposted as such or indicated by markings on the carriageway, pedestrians shall not step on to the carriageway without first making sure that they can do so without impeding vehicular traffic" (§6.c)
* "Once they have started to cross a carriageway, pedestrians shall not take an unnecessarily long route, and shall not linger or stop on the carriageway unnecessarily." (§6.d).<ref name="unece.org convention road traffic" />
In Europe, the pedestrian crossing is also dealt with European agreement supplementing the 1968 Vienna Convention on 1 May 1971 (Consolidated version including 1993, 2001, and 2006 amendments):<ref></ref>
* "In order to cross the carriageway elsewhere than at a pedestrian crossing signposted as such or indicated by markings on the carriageway, pedestrians shall not step on the carriageway without first making sure that they can do so without impeding vehicular traffic. Pedestrians shall cross the carriageway at right-angles to its axis." 
* "The standing or parking of a vehicle shall be prohibited on the carriageway: Within 5 metres (5½ yards) before pedestrian crossings and crossings for cyclists, on pedestrian crossings, on crossings for cyclists, and on level crossings"
For marking, many European countries are aligned with treaties which states that:
* "To mark pedestrian crossings, relatively broad stripes, parallel to the axis of the carriageway, should preferably be used".<ref name="ReferenceA"></ref>
* "To mark cyclist crossings, either transverse lines, or other markings which cannot be confused with those of pedestrian crossings, shall be used."
The convention on road sign also provide warning models for signs and symbol. In those countries, the "pedestrian crossing sign" is on a blue or black ground, with a white or yellow triangle where the symbol is displayed in black or dark blue.<ref name="ReferenceA" />
In Europe, the minimum width recommended for pedestrian crossings is 2.5 m (or 8-foot) on roads on which the speed limit is lower than 60&nbsp;km/h (or 37&nbsp;mph), and 4 m (or 13-foot) on roads wit a higher or no speed limit.<ref name="ReferenceA" />
===Australia===
In Australia, the terminology pedestrian crossing is used.
Pictograms are standard on all traffic light controlled crossings. Like some other countries, a flashing red sequence is used prior to steady red to clear pedestrians. Moments after, in some instances, a flashing yellow sequence (for motorists) can begin indicating that the vehicles may proceed through the crossing if safe to do so; this is fairly uncommon however. In districts with heavier traffic warranting the use of a traffic light such as inner city areas, the equivalent of the US 'standard' configuration is used.
Zebra crossings are common in low traffic areas and their approaches may be marked by zigzag lines.
Reflector signposting is used at crossings in school zones; however, given that most school crossings in the country are manned, these signs only serve as a warning to motorists.
==Signals==
===Pedestrian call buttons===
Call buttons are installed at traffic lights with a dedicated pedestrian signal, and are used to bring up the pedestrian "walk" indication in locations where they function correctly.<ref name="buttons nyt"/><ref name="buttons bbc"/> In the majority of locations where call buttons are installed, pushing the button does not light up the pedestrian walk sign immediately. One Portland State University researcher notes of call buttons in the US, "Most call buttons don’t provide any feedback to the pedestrian that the traffic signal has received the input. It may appear at many locations that nothing happens."<ref name="Gan 2015"></ref> However, there are some locations where call buttons do provide confirmation feedback. At such locations, pedestrians are more likely to wait for the "walk" indications.<ref></ref>
Reports suggest that many walk buttons in some areas, such as New York City and the United Kingdom, may actually be either placebo buttons or nonworking call buttons that used to function correctly.<ref name="buttons nyt"></ref><ref name="buttons bbc"/> In the former case, these buttons are designed to give pedestrians an illusion of control while the crossing signal continues its operation as programmed.<ref name="buttons bbc"></ref> However, in instances of the latter case, such as New York City's, the buttons were simply deactivated when traffic signals were updated to automatically include pedestrian phases as part of every signal cycle. In such instances these buttons may be removed during future updates to the pedestrian signals.<ref name="buttons nyt"/><ref></ref> In the United Kingdom, pressing a button at a standalone pedestrian crossing that is unconnected to a junction will turn a traffic light red immediately, but this is not necessarily the case at a junction.<ref name="buttons bbc"/>
Sometimes, call buttons work only at some intersections, at certain times of day, or certain periods of the year, such as in New York City or in Boston, Massachusetts.<ref name="buttons nyt"/><ref name=radioboston/> In Boston, some busy intersections are programmed to give a pedestrian cycle during certain times of day (so pushing the button is not necessary) but at off-peak times a button push is required to get a pedestrian cycle. In neighboring Cambridge, a button press is always required if a button is available, though the city prefers to build signals where no button is present and the pedestrian cycle always happens between short car cycles.<ref name=radioboston/> In both cases the light will not turn immediately, but will wait until the next available pedestrian slot in a pre-determined rotation.<ref name=radioboston></ref>
===Countdown timers===
Some pedestrian signals integrate a countdown timer, showing how many seconds are remaining for the clearing phase. In the United States, San Francisco was the first major city to install countdown signals to replace older pedestrian modules, doing so on a trial basis starting in March 2001.<ref></ref> The United States MUTCD added a countdown signal as an optional feature to its 2003 edition; if included, the countdown digits would be Portland Orange, the same color as the "Upraised Hand" indication.<ref name=":10"></ref> The MUTCD's 2009 edition changed countdown timers to a mandatory feature on pedestrian signals at all signalized intersections with pedestrian clearance intervals ("flashing upraised hand" phases) longer than seven seconds. With the MUTCD guideline allotting at least one second to cross , this indicates that countdown timers are supposed to be installed on roads wider than .<ref name="mutcd-4e" /> The countdown is not supposed to be displayed during the pedestrian "walk" interval ("steady walking person" phase),<ref name="mutcd-4e"></ref>
Some municipalities have found that there are instances where pedestrian countdown signals may be less effective than standard hand/man or ""/"" signals. New York City started studying the pedestrian timers in an inconclusive 2006 study<ref></ref> but only started rolling out pedestrian timers on a large scale in 2011 after the conclusion of a second study, which found that pedestrian countdown timers were ineffective at shorter crosswalks.<ref name=":0"></ref> Additionally, a 2000 study of pedestrian countdown timers in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, at several intersections near Walt Disney World, found that pedestrians were more likely to cross the street during the pedestrian clearance interval (flashing upraised hand) if there is a timer present, compared to at intersections where there was no timer present.<ref></ref> A study in Toronto found similar results to the Florida study, determining that countdown timers may actually cause more crashes than standard hand/man signals.<ref></ref><ref></ref> However, other cities such as London found that countdown timers were effective,<ref></ref> and New York City found that countdown signals worked mainly at longer crosswalks.<ref name=":0" />
Pedestrian countdown signals are also used elsewhere around the world, such as in Buenos Aires,<ref></ref><ref></ref> India,<ref></ref> Mexico,<ref name=":1"></ref> Taiwan,<ref name=":2"></ref> and the United Arab Emirates.<ref name=":7"></ref> In Mexico City, the walking man moves his feet during the countdown.<ref name=":1" /> In Taiwan, all the crossings feature animated men called xiaoluren ("little green man"), who will walk faster immediately before the traffic signal will change. There is also always a countdown timer.<ref name=":2" />
===Variations===
In some countries, instead of "don't walk", a depiction of a red man or hand indicating when not to cross, the drawing of the person crossing appears with an "X" drawn over it.
Some countries around the Baltic Sea in Scandinavia duplicate the red light. Instead of one red light, there are two which both illuminate at the same time.
In many parts of eastern Germany, particularly the former German Democratic Republic, the design of the crossing man (Ampelmännchen) has a hat. There are also female Ampelmännchen in western Germany and the Netherlands.<ref name=":1" /> Other countries also use unusual "walk" and "don't walk" pedestrian indicators. In southwest Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, there are pedestrian signal lights that resemble Astro Boy.<ref name="Metcalfe 2014"></ref> In Lisbon, some signals have a "don't walk" indicator that dances; these "dancing man" signals, created by Daimler AG, were created to encourage pedestrians to wait for the "walk" indicator, with the result that 81% more pedestrians stopped and waited for the "walk" light compared to at crosswalks with conventional signals.<ref></ref>
=== Leading Pedestrian Interval ===
In some areas, the signal timing technique of a Leading Pedestrian Interval (LPI) allows pedestrians exclusive access to a crosswalk, typically 3–7 seconds, before vehicular traffic is permitted.<ref></ref><ref>
===Key-based system===
In Perth, Western Australia, an extended phase system called "Keywalk" was developed by the Main Roads Department of Western Australia in response to concerns from disability advocates about the widening of the Albany Highway in that city in the mid-1990s. The Department felt that extending the walk phase permanently on cross streets would cause too much disruption to traffic flow on the highway and so the Keywalk system was developed to allow for those who needed an extended green light phase to cross the road safely. A small electronic key adjusted the green/walk and flashing red/complete crossing phases to allow more time for the key holder to complete the crossing of the highway safely. The system was first installed at the junction of Albany Highway and Cecil Avenue.<ref>Keywalk for the disabled is an Australian first (March 1995). Western Roads: official journal of Main Roads, Western Australia, 18(4), p.10. Perth: Main Roads Department.</ref> It is unclear what became of this system.
==Lighting==
There are two types of crosswalk lights: those that illuminate the whole crosswalk area, and warning lights.<ref>Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. American National Standard Practice for Roadway Lighting. Publication IESNA-RP-8-00. Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, New York, 2000.</ref>
The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America currently provides engineering design standards for highway lighting. In the US, in conventional intersections, area lighting is typically provided by pole-mounted luminaires.<ref>Hasson, P., P. Lutkevich, B. Ananthanarayanan, P. Watson, and R. Knoblauch. Field Test for Lighting to Improve Safety at Pedestrian Crosswalks. Presented at the 16th Biennial Transportation Research Board Visibility Symposium, Iowa City, Ia., 2002.</ref> These systems illuminate the crosswalk as well as surrounding areas, and do not always provide enough contrast between the pedestrian and his or her background.
There have been many efforts to create lighting scenarios that offer better nighttime illumination in crosswalks. Some innovative concepts include:
===Illuminating lights===
* Bollard posts containing linear light sources inside. These posts have been shown to sufficiently illuminate the pedestrian but not the background, consequently increasing contrast and improving pedestrian visibility and detection.<ref></ref> Although this method shows promise in being incorporated into crosswalk lighting standards, more studies need to be done.<ref></ref><ref>Bullough, J.D., X. Zhang, N.P. Skinner, and M.S. Rea. Design and Evaluation of Effective Crosswalk Lighting. Publication FHWA-NJ-2009-03. New Jersey Department of Transportation, Trenton, NJ, 2009.</ref>
* Festooned strings of light over the top of the crosswalk.<ref></ref>
===Warning lights===
* In-pavement lighting oriented to face oncoming traffic.<ref></ref>
* In-pavement, flashing warning lights oriented upwards (especially visible to children, the short stature, and smombies)<ref></ref><ref></ref>
* Pole-mounted, flashing warning lights (mounted similar to a traffic signal).
*Pedestrian warning signs enhanced with LED lights either within the sign face<ref> urltoken Embedded LEDs in Signs, Federal highway Administration, May 2009</ref> or underneath it.<ref>Van Houten, Ron and & Malenfant, J.E. Louis, urltoken Efficacy of Rectangular-shaped Rapid Flash LED Beacons, Retrieved 25 March 2011</ref><ref> urltoken Impacts of LED Brightness, Flash Pattern, and Location for Illuminated Pedestrian Traffic Control Device, Federal Highway Administration, May 2015</ref>
In areas with heavy snowfall, using in-pavement lighting can be problematic, since snow can obscure the lights, and snowplows can damage them.
==Railway pedestrian crossings==
In Finland, fences in the footpath approaching the crossing force pedestrians and bicycles to slow down to navigate a zigzag path, which also tends to force that user to look out for the train.
Pedestrian crossings across railways may be arranged differently elsewhere, such as in New South Wales, where they consist of:
* a barrier which closes when a train approaches;
* a "Red Man" light; no light when no train approaching
* an alarm
In France, when a train is approaching, a red man is shown with the word STOP flashing in red (R25 signal).<ref> urltoken Sécurisation des traversées piétonnes des voies de tramway, CETE Sud-Ouest</ref>
When a footpath crosses a railway in the United Kingdom, there will most often be gates or stiles protecting the crossing from wildlife and livestock. In situations where there is little visibility along the railway, or the footpath is especially busy, there will also be a small set of lights with an explanatory sign. When a train approaches, the signal light will change to red and an alarm will sound until the train has cleared the crossing.
==Safety==
The safety of unsignalled pedestrian or zebra crossings is somewhat contested in traffic engineering circles.
Research undertaken in New Zealand showed that a zebra crossing without other safety features on average increases pedestrian crashes by 28% compared to a location without crossings. However, if combined with (placed on top of) a speed table, zebra crossings were found to reduce pedestrian crashes by 80%.<ref name=LANDTRANSPORT></ref>
A five-year U.S. study of 1,000 marked crosswalks and 1,000 unmarked comparison sites found that on most roads, the difference in safety performance of marked and unmarked crossings is not statistically significant, unless additional safety features are used. On multilane roads carrying over 12,000 vehicles per day, a marked crosswalk is likely to have worse safety performance than an otherwise similar unmarked location, unless safety features such as raised median refuges or pedestrian beacons are also installed.<ref name="Zegeer" /> On multilane roads carrying over 15,000 vehicles per day, a marked crosswalk is likely to have worse safety performance than an unmarked location, even if raised median refuges are provided. The marking pattern had no significant effect on safety. This study only included locations where vehicle traffic was not controlled by a signal or stop sign.<ref name=Zegeer></ref>

A pedestrian crossing (primarily British English) or crosswalk (primarily American English) is a place designated for pedestrians to cross a road, street or avenue. The term "pedestrian crossing" is also used in some international treaties that pertain to road traffic and road signs, such as the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic and the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals.
Marked pedestrian crossings are often found at intersections, but may also be at other points on busy roads that would otherwise be too unsafe to cross without assistance due to vehicle numbers, speed or road widths. They are also commonly installed where large numbers of pedestrians are attempting to cross (such as in shopping areas) or where vulnerable road users (such as school children) regularly cross. Rules govern usage of the pedestrian crossings to ensure safety; for example, in some areas, the pedestrian must be more than halfway across the crosswalk before the driver proceeds.
In general, there are two types of intersections including signalized and unsignalised intersections.<ref></ref> Signalised pedestrian crossings clearly separate when each type of traffic (pedestrians or road vehicles) can use the crossing. Unsignalised crossings generally assist pedestrians, and usually prioritise pedestrians, depending on the locality. Pelican crossing use signals to keep pedestrians together where they can be seen by motorists, and where they can cross most safety across the flow of vehicle traffic, whereas zebra crossings are uncontrolled and more appropriate for lower people flows. What appears to be just pedestrian crossings can also be created largely as a traffic calming technique, especially when combined with other features like pedestrian priority, refuge islands, or raised surfaces.
