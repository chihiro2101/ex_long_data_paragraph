Ahnentafel

==Inductive reckoning==
To find out what someone's number would be without compiling a list, one must first trace how they relate back to the subject or person of interest, meaning one records that someone is the subject's father's mother's mother's father's father's&nbsp;. Once one has done that, one can use two methods.
===First method===
Use the definition that a father's number will be twice that individual's number, or a mother's will be twice plus one, and just multiply and add 1 accordingly. For instance, someone can find out what number Sophia of Hanover would be on an ahnentafel of Peter Phillips. She is Phillips's mother's mother's father's father's father's mother's father's father's father's father's father's mother. So, we multiply and add:
:1&times;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;3
::3&times;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;7
:::7&times;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;14
::::14&times;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;28
:::::28&times;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;56
::::::56&times;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;113
:::::::113&times;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;226
::::::::226&times;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;452
:::::::::452&times;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;904
::::::::::904&times;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;1808
:::::::::::1808&times;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;3616
::::::::::::3616&times;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;7233
Thus, if we were to make an ahnentafel for Peter Phillips, Electress Sophia would be #7233.
===Second method===
Write down the digit "1", which represents the subject, then from left to right write "0" for each father and "1" for each mother in the relation, ending with the ancestor of interest. The result will be the binary representation of the ancestor's ahnentafel number. Then convert the binary number to decimal form. Using the Sophia example:
:Sophia = Peter's mother's mother's father's father's father's mother's father's father's father's father's father's mother
:Sophia = 1110001000001
:1110001000001 = 1×4096 + 1×2048 + 1×1024 + 0×512 + 0×256 + 0×128 + 1×64 + 0×32 + 0×16 + 0×8 + 0×4 + 0×2 + 1×1
:Sophia = 7233
==Deductive reckoning==
We can also work in reverse to find what the relation is from the number.
===Reverse first method===
#One starts out by seeing if the number is odd or even.
#If it is odd, the last part of the relation is "mother," so subtract 1 and divide by 2.
#If it is even, the last part is "father," and one divides by 2.
#Repeat steps 2–3, and build back from the last word.
#Once one gets to 1, one is done.
On an ahnentafel of Prince William, John Wark is number 116. We follow the steps:
== Calculation of the generation number ==
The generation number can be calculated as the logarithm to base 2 of the ahnentafel number, and rounding down to a full integer by truncating decimal digits. 
For example, the number 38 is between 2<sup>5</sup>=32 and 2<sup>6</sup>=64, so log<sub>2</sub>(38) is between 5 and 6. This means that ancestor no.38 belongs to generation five, and was a great-great-great-grandparent of the reference person who is no.1 (generation zero).

The same information in a tree:
==Multiple numbers for the same person==
An ancestor may have two or more numbers due to pedigree collapse. For example in the above Ahnentafel for Prince William, Queen Victoria is both no.79 and no.81. She is no.79 because she was the great-great-grandmother of William's grandfather Prince Philip, and she is also no.81 because she was the great-great-grandmother of William's grandmother Queen Elizabeth II. The relationships are easier to follow using the ancestry tree with ahnentafel numbering.
== Other German definitions ==
European nobility took pride in displaying their descent. In the German language, the term "Ahnentafel" may refer to a list of coats of arms and names of one's ancestors, even when it does not follow the numbered tabular representation given above. In this case the German "Tafel" is taken literally to be a physical "display board" instead of an abstract scheme.
In Nazi Germany, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service required a person to prove non-Jewish ancestry with an Ariernachweis (Aryan certificate). The certificate could take the form of entries in the permanent Ahnenpass (that was sorted according to the ahnentafel numbering system) or as entries in a singular Arierschein (Aryan attestation) that was titled "Ahnentafel".

An ahnentafel (German for "ancestor table"; or ahnenreihe ("ancestor series"; is a genealogical numbering system for listing a person's direct ancestors in a fixed sequence of ascent. The subject (or proband) of the ahnentafel is listed as , the subject's father as and the mother as , the paternal grandparents as and and the maternal grandparents as and , and so on, back through the generations. Apart from , who can be male or female, all even-numbered persons are male, and all odd-numbered persons are female. In this schema, the number of any person's father is double the person's number, and a person's mother is double the person's number plus one. Using this definition of numeration, one can derive some basic information about individuals who are listed without additional research.
This construct displays a person's genealogy compactly, without the need for a diagram such as a family tree. It is particularly useful in situations where one may be restricted to presenting a genealogy in plain text, for example, in e-mails or newsgroup articles. In effect, an ahnentafel is a Binary tree#Methods for storing binary trees by listing the nodes (individuals) in level-order (in generation order).
The ahnentafel system of numeration is also known as: the Eytzinger Method, for Michaël Eytzinger, the Austrian-born historian who first published the principles of the system in 1590;<ref>Eytzinger, Michael, Thesaurus principum hac aetate in Europa viventium, quo progenitores eorum. simul ac fratres et sonores inde ab origine reconduntur. usque ad annum., Cologne: G. Kempensem, 1590 (1591). Note: In commentaries, his surname may appear in variant forms, including: Aitsingeri, Aitsingero, Aitsingerum, Eyzingern.</ref> the Sosa Method, named for Jeronimo de Sosa, the Spanish genealogist who popularized the numbering system in his work Noticia de la gran casa de los marqueses de Villafranca in 1676;<ref>Jouniaux, Léo, Généalogie : pratique, méthode, recherche, Quercy: Seuil, 2006, pp. 44–45.</ref> and the Sosa–Stradonitz Method, for Stephan Kekulé von Stradonitz, the genealogist and son of Friedrich August Kekulé, who published his interpretation of Sosa's method in his Ahnentafel-atlas in 1898.<ref>Kekulé von Stradonitz, Stephan, Ahnentafel-atlas.

"Ahnentafel" is a loan word from the German language, and its German equivalents are Ahnenreihe and Ahnenliste. An ahnentafel list is sometimes called a "Kekulé" after Stephan Kekulé von Stradonitz. A variant of is known in French as Seize Quartiers.
