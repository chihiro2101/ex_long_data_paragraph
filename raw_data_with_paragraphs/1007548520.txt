==Corporate Social Responsibility==
===Missing Children===
==== U.S. ====
LexisNexis Risk Solutions developed the ADAM (Automated Delivery of Alerts on Missing children) program in 2000 to help the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) find missing children.<ref> urltoken ADAM distributes missing child alert posters to law enforcement, hospitals, libraries and businesses within specific geographic search areas. The system was expanded in 2017 to allow individuals to receive an email alert when a child is reported missing near to them.<ref></ref> 
In 2017, a feature was added to ADAM to allow NCMEC to focus on a highway where a missing child and abductor may be travelling in order to distribute posters to recipients along the relevant corridor. Combining this filter along with the system’s radius search allows for broad, yet targeted, poster coverage. Functionality was added to ADAM to allow members of the public to sign up for missing child email alerts in their area. More than 1.8 million individuals, private enterprises, hospitals, schools, news outlets and law agencies have signed up to receive automated ADAM alerts.
==== U.K. ====
In 2017, LexisNexis Risk Solutions began working with the charity Missing People and the UK National Crime Agency to support their Child Rescue Alert service, which disseminates missing alerts via text message. Along with Charlie Hedges Advisory (one of the U.K.’s foremost experts on missing persons), LexisNexis Risk Solutions and Missing People scoped a training course to assist law enforcement, schools, hospitals and others with missing cases, particularly those involving children who are abducted and/or trafficked.
===Food Stamp Fraud Prevention===
Since 2013, the Florida Department of Children Families has used LexisNexis Risk Solutions to identity management solutions to prevent food stamp fraud and improve operational efficiencies, achieving a total cost avoidance of more than $843.7 million.
===Humanitarian Emergency Education ===
In 2017, LexisNexis Risk Solutions developed the Global Business Coalition for Education’s Rapid Education Action (REACT) database to record private sector educational contributions and assets that can be deployed quickly in the wake of a humanitarian emergency.
=== Law Enforcement ===
====PSDE Database====
The Public Safety Data Exchange (PSDEX) is a contributory database that of more than 1,300 law enforcement agencies across the U.S. that was created by LexisNexis Risk Solutions. PSDEX helps its participants solve crimes, identify threats and anticipate future threats. LexisNexis Risk Solutions created an Advisory Committee to advise on policy and governance of PSDEX data, to help assure adherence to federal Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS), state and local standards for security and privacy of law enforcement-provided data. The PSDEX Advisory Committee is composed of former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Secret Service, metropolitan police department and other criminal justice experts, in partnership with LexisNexis Risk Solutions leaders.
====LexisNexis Accurint Virtual Crime Center====
The LexisNexis Accurint Virtual Crime Center gives law enforcement “greater visibility into crime in both their jurisdictions and nationwide by linking billions of public records with agency-provided data.” It links to PSDEX and brings together disconnected data to provide a more comprehensive view of people’s identities so that law enforcement agencies can better target investigations, identify patterns, predict upcoming events and deploy resources more efficiently.
==COVID-19==
===COVID-19 Analyzer===
In April, 2020, LexisNexis Risk Solutions created a free tracking urltoken tool to monitor and report the progress of the Covid-19 virus and provide better contextual understanding of the pandemic’s evolution.
