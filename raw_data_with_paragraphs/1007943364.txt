Diodotus I

==Background and satrapy==
The region of Bactria, which encompassed the Oxus river in modern Afghanistan and Tajikistan, was conquered by Alexander the Great between 329 and 327 BC and he settled a number of his veterans in the region. In the wars which followed Alexander's death in 323 BC, the region was largely left to its own devices, but it was incorporated in the Seleucid empire by Seleucus I between 308 and 305 BC, along with the rest of the territories that Alexander had conquered in Iran and Central Asia. Seleucus entrusted the region to his son and co-regent, Antiochus I, around 295 BC. Between 295 and 281 BC, Antiochus I established firm Seleucid control over the region. The region was divided into a number of satrapy (provinces), of which Bactria was one. Antiochus founded or refounded a number of cities on the Greek model in the region and he opened a number of mints to produce coinage on the Attic weight standard. After Antiochus I succeeded his father as ruler of the Seleucid empire in 281 BC, he entrusted the east to his own son, Antiochus II who remained in this position until he in turn succeeded to the throne in 261 BC.<ref></ref>
Diodotus' place and date of birth are not attested. He probably became Seleucid satrap (governor) of Bactria during Antiochus II's period in charge of the east, thus about a generation after the original establishment of Seleucid control over the region. The Babylonian Astronomical Diaries record that an unnamed Bactrian satrap sent a herd of twenty war elephants to Babylon at the beginning of 273 BC to join the Seleucid forces fighting against Ptolemaic Egypt in the First Syrian War.<ref>Astronomical Diaries I, p. 345, No. –273B ‘Rev. 30’- 32’</ref> This satrap may have been Diodotus, or a predecessor.<ref>First proposed by . expresses great scepticism.</ref> Archaeological evidence for the period comes largely from excavations of the city of Ai-Khanoum, where this period saw the expansion of irrigation networks, the construction and expansion of civic buildings, and some military activity, probably raiding by nomads from the Central Asian steppe. As satrap, Diodotus was probably involved in these matters, though the specifics are not recoverable.<ref></ref>
==Secession from the Seleucid realm==
At some point, Diodotus seceded from the Seleucid empire, establishing his realm as an independent kingdom, known in modern scholarship as the Graeco-Bactrian kingdom. The event is mentioned briefly by the Roman historian Justin:
The date of this event is unclear. The literary evidence is as follows:
* Justin says that the rebellion occurred 'around the same time' as the Parni conquest of Parthia from the Seleucid realm, but his dating of this event is confused—he places it in 256 BC, but during the reign of Seleucus II (246-225 BC).<ref name=J414>Justin, Epitome of Pompeius Trogus 41.4</ref>
* Strabo further claims that Arsaces, the leader of the Parni, had been based in Bactria before the conquest. He says that Diodotus drove Arsaces out of Bactria and maintained hostilities against the Parni.<ref>Strabo 11.9.3</ref>
* Ammianus Marcellinus places the Parthian rebellion in the reign of a Seleucus (II?).<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus 23.6.2-3</ref>
* Arrian's lost Parthian History seems to have claimed that the Seleucid satrap who was overthrown by the Parthians was appointed to that position by Antiochus II.<ref>Arrian FGrH F30a</ref>
* Appian states that the Parthian rebellion took place in 246 BC, during the Third Syrian War, in the wake of Ptolemy III's conquest of Seleucid Syria and Babylon.<ref>Appian Syriaca 65</ref> The Adulis inscription set up by Ptolemy III to celebrate this event claims that Bactria was among Ptolemy's conquests, which is hyperbole but might indicate that Bactria had been part of the Seleucid empire up to this point.<ref name=H5860></ref>
Different scholars have argued for a 'High Chronology' which places Diodotus' independence around 255 BC in the reign of Antiochus II, or a 'Low Chronology' which dates the secession around 245 BC at the beginning of the reign of Seleucus II.<ref></ref> Several scholars have expressed pessimism about the possibility of resolving this debate with the available evidence. Frank Holt argues that the secession should be seen as a gradual process in which Diodotus and other eastern Seleucid satraps aggregated ever more autonomy, rather than a single event. In his opinion, the process probably began in the 250s BC and was completed in the reign of Seleucus II.<ref></ref> The archaeological evidence reveals no signs of discontinuity or destruction in this period. The transition from Seleucid rule to independence thus seems to have been accomplished peacefully.<ref name=H5860/>
Before Diodotus came to power, there was already a mint in Bactria—based at Ai-Khanoum<ref></ref> or at Bactra,<ref></ref> which minted royal coinage in the name of the Seleucid sovereign, with the reigning Seleucid king's portrait on the obverse and an image of Apollo, the Seleucid patron deity, sitting on an omphalus. As satrap, Diodotus continued to issue these coins, in the name of Antiochus II. This included gold staters, silver tetradrachms, drachms, and hemidrachms, and some bronze coins. None of them seem to have been issued in great quantity.<ref name=H87101></ref>
Probably while he was still satrap, Diodotus introduced a new coinage, which consisted of a large number of silver tetradrachms and, later, a small number of gold staters. These coins have the head of a male figure on the obverse, presumably Diodotus himself, shown wearing the diadem—a band of cloth wrapped around the head, with two strips hanging down the back, which had been the standard symbol of Hellenistic kingship since the time of Alexander the Great. The image seems to gradually age over time, suggesting that it was intended as a realistic portrait of Diodotus. The reverse of these coins abandoned the Seleucid god Apollo in favour of a depiction of Zeus preparing to throw his thunderbolt. The choice of Zeus may have been intended as a reference to Diodotus himself whose name meant 'Gift of Zeus' in Greek. Alternatively, it may look back to early coinage struck by Seleucus I, from which the reverse image is taken. The legend on the reverse of these coins still reads ('Of King Antiochus'). The coinage thus clearly proclaimed Diodotus' authority, but retained some ambiguity about the extent of his independence from the Seleucids.<ref name=H87101/>
Towards the end of this series, Diodotus added a small wreath on the reverse to the left of Zeus. The wreath was a Greek symbol of victory—Frank Holt suggests that it commemorated a victory over the Parthians and that this victory was also the source of Diodotus' epithet soter (savour). Other Hellenistic kings, such as Antiochus I Soter and Attalus I Soter of Pergamum took this title to commemorate victories over existential barbarian threats. Diodotus may have done the same. This may further have been the occasion of Diodotus I's assumption of the royal title of king (basileus)—as a similar victory was for Attalus I.<ref name=H87101/>
The date at which this coinage began is not clear. Frank Holt suggests it was around 250 BC. The coinage seems to have been minted simultaneously at two mints—one with a more aged portrait ('Series A') and the other with a younger portrait ('Series C and E'). The mint of 'Series A & C' is generally identified with the Ai-Khanoum/Bactra mint, that of 'Series E' has not been localised. Holt proposes that the younger portrait depicts Diodotus II, perhaps junior co-regent with Diodotus I. After a break, both mints produce coins with the younger portrait and with the legend now reading ('Of Diodotus', Series D and F). Holt suggests that this break marks the death of Diodotus I and accession of Diodotus II.<ref name=H87101/>
A few tetradrachm coins depicting Diodotus I in a more 'idealising' guise were issued late in Diodotus II's reign ('Series B'). Diodotus appears also on coins struck in his memory by the later Graeco-Bactrian kings Agathocles and Antimachus. These coins imitate the original design of the tetradrachms issued by Diodotus I, but with a legend on the obverse identifying the king as ('Of Diodotus Soter').<ref name=H87101/>
Diodotus also issued a bronze coinage ('Series G'). This coinage consisted of two denominations: a 'double' (c. 8.4 grammes, 20-24 millimetres in diameter) and a 'single' (4.2 g, 14–18&nbsp;mm)—possibly worth 1/48th of a silver drachm.<ref></ref> All denominations bore the head of Hermes wearing a petasus hat on the obverse, and two caducei (winged staffs, an attribute of Hermes) crossing one another on the reverse, with a legend reading ('Of King Antiochus'). There is a similar break to the silver and gold coins, after which the bronzes are issued with the legend ('Of Diodotus', 'Series H'). These bronze coins were found in very large numbers in the excavations of Ai-Khanoum.<ref></ref>
==Marriage and issue==
The only attested relative of Diodotus I is his son and successor, Diodotus II, whose mother is unknown. W. W. Tarn proposed that Diodotus I had married a daughter of Antiochus II and his wife Laodice I around 246 BC, as his second wife. He placed her birth around 266 BC and called her 'Apama'. Tarn further proposed that the marriage produced a daughter, born around c. 250 BC, who subsequently married Euthydemus I and was involved in his murder of Diodotus II and usurpation of the throne.<ref name=T73></ref> There is no actual evidence at all for either of these marriages or even for the existence of 'Apama' and her daughter.<ref></ref>

Diodotus I Soter (Greek: ; epithet means "the Saviour"; c. 285&nbsp;BC – c. 235 BC) was Seleucid satrap of Bactria. Diodotus became independent of the Seleucids empire around 255 or 245 BC, and established the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, which endured in various forms until the beginning of the first century AD. As ruler, he is known to have pursued hostilities with the Parthians and to have minted coinage with his own image but not in his own name. He died around 235 BC and was succeeded by his son, Diodotus II.
Diodotus' career was recounted by Apollodorus of Artemita in the Parthian History, but this text is lost, and surviving literary sources only mention him in passing.<ref></ref> Thus, most details of Diodotus' life and career have to be reconstructed from numismatics.
