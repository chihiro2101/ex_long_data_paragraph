It "is the Roman imperial world, which in turn represents the world alienated from God."<ref>Ibid., 506.</ref> Some exegesis interpret the passage as a scathing critique of a servant people of Rome who do the Empire's bidding, interpreting that the author of Revelation was speaking of the Herodians—a party of Jews friendly to Rome and open to its influence, like the Hellenizers of centuries past—and later, corrupt Hasmoneans, where the ruler of Jerusalem or Roman Judea exercised his power at the pleasure of the Roman emperor, and was dependent on Roman influence, like Herod the Great in the Gospel of Luke.

According to the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, "The characteristics ascribed to this Babylon apply to Rome rather than to any other city of that age: (a) as ruling over the kings of the earth (Revelation 17:18); (b) as sitting on seven mountains (Revelation 17:9); (c) as the center of the world's merchandise (Revelation 18:3, 11–13); (d) as the corrupter of the nations (Revelation 17:2; 18:3; 19:2); (e) as the persecutor of the saints (Revelation 17:6)."<ref></ref>
According to Eusebius of Caesarea Babylon would be Rome or the Roman Empire:
"And Peter makes mention of Mark in his first epistle which they say that he wrote in Rome itself, as is indicated by him, when he calls the city, by a figure, Babylon, as he does in the following words: «The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you; and so does Marcus my son.»(1 Peter 5:13)"<ref></ref>

It refers to an Apostasy false queen, a former "bride" who has been Infidelity and who, even though she has been divorced and cast out because of unfaithfulness, continues to falsely claim to be the "queen" of the spiritual realm.<ref> urltoken Hunting the Whore of Babylon </ref><ref>Douglas Connelly. "The Indispensable Guide to Practically Everything: Bible Prophecy and End Times". </ref><ref></ref> This symbolism did not fit the case of Rome at the time. Proponents of this view suggest that the "seven mountains" in Rev 17:9 are the seven hills on which Jerusalem stands and the "fall of Babylon" in Rev 18 is the fall and Siege of Jerusalem (70).<ref>A commentary on the Apocalypse of John, Edmondo Lupieri, p.7</ref>
Several Old Testament prophets referred to Jerusalem as being a spiritual harlot and a mother of such harlotry (Isaiah 1:21; Jeremiah 2:20; 3:1–11; Ezekiel 16:1–43; 23, Epistle to the Galatians 4:25). Some of these Old Testament prophecies, as well as the warnings in the New Testament concerning Jerusalem, are in fact very close to the text concerning Babylon in Revelation. This suggests that John of Patmos may well have actually been citing those prophecies in his description of Babylon.<ref name="Drane1999"></ref>
For example, in Matthew 23:34–37 and Luke 11:47–51, Jesus himself assigned all of the bloodguilt for the killing of the prophets and of the saints (of all time) to the Pharisees of Jerusalem. In Revelation 17:6 and 18:20,24, almost identical phrasing is used in charging that very same bloodguilt to Babylon. This is also bolstered by Jesus' statement that "it's not possible for a prophet to be killed outside of Jerusalem." (Luke 13:33).<ref></ref>
Revelation 11:8 indicates that only Jerusalem is being referenced allegorically as “Sodom” and “Egypt”; “Where indeed their lord was crucified”, corroborated therewith Jesus Christ's statement in Luke 13:33. Moreover, Revelation 21:9–27 refers to “The New Jerusalem”, whereas Revelation 21:22 states, “And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it." This contrasts with “The Synagogue of Satan” in Revelation 3:9. This coincides with St. Stephen's charge against the Sanhedrin, in Acts 7:43, “Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.”
== Historicist and idealistic interpretations ==
=== Catholic view ===
In the most common medieval (Catholic) view, deriving from Augustine of Hippo's The City of God (early 5th century), Babylon and Jerusalem referred to two spiritual cities (or civilizations) which were spiritually at war with one another, throughout all of history:<blockquote>Babylon from Babel is interpreted confusion, Jerusalem vision of peace. .They are mingled, and from the very beginning of mankind mingled they run on unto the end of the world. .Two loves make up these two cities: love of God makes Jerusalem, love of the world makes Babylon.<ref></ref></blockquote>They also represented two principles at war with one another, inside each individual person, even inside seemingly worldly Christian monarchs; thus Augustine could boast approvingly, ".believing Christian monarchs of this world came to the city of Rome, as to the head of Babylon: they went not to the temple of the Emperor, but to the Saint Peter's tomb."<ref></ref> On the other hand, even seemingly religious popes could become so entangled in worldly pursuits as to constitute "Babylon", in Dante's eyes:
Dante Alighieri equated the corruption and simony of the pontificate of Pope Boniface VIII (term 1294–1303) with the Whore of Babylon in Canto 19 of his Inferno:
: Di voi pastor s'accorse il Vangelista,
: quando colei che siede sopra l'acque
: puttaneggiar coi regi a lui fu vista.
: (Shepherds like you the Evangelist had in mind when he saw the one that sits upon the waters committing fornication with the kings.)
=== Reformation view ===
Historicist interpreters commonly used the phrase "Whore of Babylon" to refer to the Catholic Church. Reformation writers Martin Luther (1483–1546, author of On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church), John Calvin (1509–1564), and John Knox (1510–1572, author of The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstruous Regiment of Women) taught this association.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
Most early Protestant Reformers believed, and the modern Seventh-day Adventist Church teaches, that in Bible prophecy a woman represents a church.<ref> urltoken Commentary on Daniel and Revelation.

: For the land has committed great harlotry
: By departing from the ." (Hosea 1:2 <ref>See also "They have committed adultery with their idols" (Ezekiel 23:37).</ref>
They also believed that the primary location of this unfaithful church is stated in the same chapter.
: "And the woman whom you saw is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth." (Revelation 17:18)
The connection noted above on the seven hills of Rome is argued to locate the church.<ref name="Walvoord, John F pg. 603-610">Walvoord, John F. "Every Prophecy of the Bible". pg. 603–610. .</ref><ref>LaHaye, Tim. "Revelation Unveiled". pg. 262–271. (softcover).</ref><ref></ref>
Identification of the Pope as the Antichrist was written into Protestant creeds such as the Westminster Confession of 1646. The identification of the Roman Catholic Church with the Whore of Babylon is kept in the Scofield Reference Bible (whose 1917 edition identified "ecclesiastical Babylon" with "apostate Christendom headed by the Papacy"). An image from the 1545 edition of Luther's Bible depicts the Whore as wearing the papal tiara.<ref> urltoken 
=== Seventh-day Adventist view ===
Adventism believe that the whore of Babylon represents the fallen state of traditional Christianity, especially in the Catholic Church. Other churches (predominantly Protestant) are generally considered either part of the harlot or her daughters. Adventists further hold that the persecution of the "saints" in Revelation 17:6 represents the persecution of believers who rejected the doctrines introduced by the Roman Catholic Church and were based on pagan Roman beliefs. The Persecution during the Middle Ages of anyone who opposed the Catholic Church, especially by the Inquisition, and the persecution of the Waldensians and the Huguenots are cited as examples.<ref></ref>
Seventh-day Adventists interpret Revelation 17:18 as a prophecy of the false church, which has power over the kings of the earth. They consider the pope to be in apostasy for allowing pagan rituals, beliefs and ceremonies to come into the church. They consider the Papacy, as a continuation of the Roman Empire, as a fulfillment of : "For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way."<ref></ref>
Ellen G. White's The Great Controversy (1858) states that "Spiritual Babylon" would have worldwide influence, affecting "all nations", that Imperial Roman Empire could not meet the criteria, as she wrote that it only had influence in the Old World. Like many reformation-era Protestant leaders, her writings also describe the Catholic Church as a fallen church, and it plays a nefarious eschatological role as the antagonist against God's true church and that the pope is the Antichrist.<ref></ref><ref name=autogenerated1></ref>
=== Jehovah's Witnesses view ===

=== Latter-day Saint view ===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) views the Whore of Babylon and its Book of Mormon equivalent, the "great and abominable church", as having dominion over the entire earth and representing a singular group as well as groups of carnal individuals seeking wealth, sexual immorality, and the persecution or death of saints.<ref name = SER /> The Whore of Babylon, or the Devil's Church, consists of all organisations not associated or against all faithful people in Christ.
