Dirac Medal

== The Dirac Medal and Lecture (University of New South Wales) ==
The first-established prize is the Dirac Medal for the Advancement of Theoretical Physics, awarded by the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, jointly with the Australian Institute of Physics on the occasion of the public Dirac Lecture.<ref name=2015UNSW/> The Lecture and the Medal commemorate the visit to the university in 1975 of Professor Dirac, who gave five lectures there. The lectures were subsequently published as a book Directions of Physics (Wiley, 1978 – H. Hora and J. Shepanski, eds.). Professor Dirac donated the royalties from this book to the University for the establishment of the Dirac Lecture series. The prize includes a silver medal and honorarium. It was first awarded in 1979.

== Dirac Medal of the ICTP ==
The Dirac Medal of the ICTP is given each year by the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in honour of physicist Paul Dirac. The award, announced each year on 8 August (Dirac's birthday), was first awarded in 1985.<ref name="PT1987"></ref>
An international committee of distinguished scientists selects the winners from a list of nominated candidates. The Committee invites nominations from scientists working in the fields of theoretical physics or mathematics.
The Dirac Medal of the ICTP is not awarded to Nobel Prize, Fields Medalists, or Wolf Prize winners.<ref name="PT1987"/>
However, several Dirac Medallists have subsequently won one of these awards.<ref name="PTWittenFields"></ref><ref name="PTNambuWolf"></ref><ref name="PTNambuNobel"></ref><ref name="PTSinaiWolf"></ref>
The medallists receive a prize of US$5,000.
