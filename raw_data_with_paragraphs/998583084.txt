London Philharmonic Orchestra

=== 1960s and 70s ===
In 1962 the orchestra undertook its first tour of India, Australia, and the Far East. The conductors were Sargent and John Pritchard. The latter was appointed the LPO's chief conductor in 1962, presiding over what one player described as "an era of supremely good taste".<ref name="moore" /> From its outset in 1932, harpists (traditionally female) excepted, the orchestra had maintained Beecham's "men only" regime; in 1963 the rule was dropped, the first woman violinist was recruited, and within two years female players achieved equal conditions of membership with their male colleagues.<ref>Pirouet, p.&nbsp;132.</ref>
Pritchard was also music director of Glyndebourne Festival Opera in Sussex, and it was partly due to his influence that in 1964 the LPO replaced the RPO as Glyndebourne's resident orchestra, providing the players with stable guaranteed work in the slack summer months.<ref>Pirouet, pp.&nbsp;132&nbsp;and&nbsp;134.</ref> The number of LPO concerts in the provinces fell during the 1960s, and ceased to be a major factor in the orchestra's finances.<ref>Pirouet, p.&nbsp;139.</ref> During the 1960s the orchestra gave fund-raising concerts in which guests from outside the world of classical music appeared, including Danny Kaye, Duke Ellington and Tony Bennett.<ref name="moore" /> Its regular complement at the end of the decade was 88 players.<ref>Peacock, p.&nbsp;8.</ref>
In 1967 the LPO appointed Bernard Haitink as its principal conductor. He remained with the orchestra for twelve years, to date (2018) the longest tenure of the post. His concerts made a strong impression with the public, and within months the LPO was playing to ninety per cent capacity audiences at the Festival Hall, far outstripping the other London orchestras.<ref>Pirouet, p.&nbsp;138.</ref> Among the composers with whom Haitink was associated were Bruckner and Mahler, whose symphonies featured frequently in the LPO's concerts during the Haitink period, as did those of Shostakovich, particularly the Tenth, which Pirouet describes as the calling card of the orchestra and conductor.<ref>Pirouet, p.&nbsp;149.</ref> With Vladimir Ashkenazy, Haitink and the LPO gave a six-concert cycle of the Beethoven symphonies and piano concertos, for which the Festival Hall was full to capacity. In The Times, Joan Chissell described the orchestra's playing as "worthy of any festival".<ref>Chissell, Joan. "LPO/Haitink", The Times, 18 March 1974, p.&nbsp;9.</ref> There was some discontent within the LPO that Haitink's prolific recordings were almost always with the other orchestra of which he was the chief conductor, the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. Pirouet comments that as Haitink recorded exclusively for the Dutch firm Philips it was to be expected that the Amsterdam orchestra would be preferred, and in any case the LPO was recording extensively with Boult, Solti, Daniel Barenboim and many others.<ref>Pirouet, p.&nbsp;153.</ref> In the 1970s international tours continued, with itineraries taking in the US, Western Europe, the Soviet Union, and, in 1972, China, long inaccessible to Western musicians, where the orchestra met an enthusiastic welcome.<ref>Pirouet, p.&nbsp;150.</ref>
In 1973 the LPO was caught up in a recurring phenomenon of London orchestral life: the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras is too much for one city, and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge.<ref name="p155" /> On this occasion the targets were the LPO and the New Philharmonia; the latter, a self-governing body formed under its new name when the Philharmonia was disbanded in 1964, was going through a bad patch, professionally and financially. The proposed merger would inevitably have led to redundancies, and the player-owners of both orchestras rejected the plan.<ref name="p155">Pirouet, p.&nbsp;155.</ref>
One of the constant difficulties of London orchestras was the lack of good rehearsal space and facilities. In 1973, acting jointly with the LSO, the LPO acquired and began restoring a disused church in Southwark, converting it into the Henry Wood Hall, a convenient and acoustically excellent rehearsal space and recording studio, opened in 1975.<ref>Mann, William. "The making of a rehearsal hall", The Times, 17 June 1975, p.&nbsp;11.</ref>
Guest conductors in the 1970s included Erich Leinsdorf, Carlo Maria Giulini, Eugen Jochum, Riccardo Chailly, Klaus Tennstedt and Solti. When Haitink announced in 1977 that he would step down as principal conductor at the end of the 1978–79 season, Solti, who had been principal guest conductor since 1971, agreed to succeed him.<ref>Pirouet, p.&nbsp;147.</ref>
=== 1980s and 90s ===
In 1982 the orchestra celebrated its golden jubilee. At the anniversary concert Solti conducted the programme with which Beecham had inaugurated the LPO. Pirouet comments that with the exception of Delius's Brigg Fair, the music was as ideally suited to Solti's musical persona as to Beecham's.<ref>Pirouet, p.&nbsp;174.</ref> In The Guardian, Edward Greenfield wrote, "I doubt if the LPO has ever played so beautifully, even in the days of Beecham".<ref>Greenfield, Edward. "LPO/Solti – 50th anniversary", The Guardian, 8 October 1982, p.&nbsp;10.</ref>
Solti stepped down at the end of the jubilee season, and was succeeded by Klaus Tennstedt, of whom The Times commented, "Tennstedt found the orchestra sensitive and flexible, and his players regarded him with a warmth that is by no means universally extended by musicians to their conductors".<ref name=tten>"Klaus Tennstedt", The Times, 13 January 1998, p.&nbsp;21.</ref> His time as chief conductor (1983–87) was celebrated for its musical achievements, but was marked by his failing health and frequent cancellations. As with Haitink and Solti, Bruckner and Mahler were prominent in the LPO's concerts with Tennstedt. Unlike his two predecessors Tennstedt preferred to record with the LPO rather than major continental or American orchestras; among the many sets they made together was a complete cycle of Mahler's symphonies for EMI.<ref>Greenfield, Edward. "A German vision for London music", The Guardian, 13 January 1998, p.&nbsp;16.</ref> In 1984 the LPO and the Philharmonia began negotiations that went on for years following an Arts Council proposal to name one London orchestra as the principal resident orchestra of the Festival Hall, with concomitant extra funding. The two orchestras were interested in making a counter-proposal for a joint residency, but the matter was not resolved until 1995 when their plan was finally implemented.<ref>Pirouet, pp.&nbsp;183&nbsp;and&nbsp;223.</ref> From the outset of the LPO's existence as a self-governing co-operative in 1939, its chief executive had always been appointed from within the orchestra's ranks. In 1985 this tradition was broken with the recruitment of John Willan, a qualified accountant as well as an alumnus of the Royal Academy of Music and a successful recording producer for EMI.<ref>Pirouet, p.&nbsp;187.</ref>
In August 1987 Tennstedt, taken ill at a rehearsal, felt so unequal to continuing in his post that he resigned on the spot. He continued to appear with the LPO as a guest, with the title of "conductor laureate";<ref name=tten/> in 1989 Richard Morrison of The Times wrote that the LPO still played better for Tennstedt than for anyone else.<ref>Morrison, Richard. "Mahler's quiet hero", The Times, 17 February 1989, p.&nbsp;18.</ref> Tennstedt's resignation was a severe blow to the orchestra, and there was no obvious successor: Morrison observed that the best-known conductors – Barenboim, Riccardo Muti and Simon Rattle – with whom the orchestra was then associated were committed to other projects until the 1990s, and those possible contenders such as Semyon Bychkov and Franz Welser-Möst were largely unknown in London.<ref>Morrison, Richard. "Tennstedt hard to replace", The Times, 26 August 1987, p.&nbsp;14.</ref> No successor was appointed until 1990 when Welser-Möst was named as the new principal conductor. His tenure was controversial; he received the nickname "Frankly Worse than Most" and many harshly critical reviews.<ref>Hewett, Ivan. urltoken "Why all those insults made me stronger", The Daily Telegraph, 18 August 2005</ref> He brought with him a recording contract with EMI, but management turnover, financial stresses, and political disputes at the Southbank Centre at the time contributed to the difficulty of the working atmosphere in the orchestra.<ref>Kenyon, Nicholas urltoken "A Young Conductor Starts at the Top", The New York Times, 15 March 1992; and Oestreich, James R. urltoken "Battered but Unbowed, a Maestro Rebounds", The New York Times , 13 November 1994</ref> There were complaints that the orchestra's high standards of playing were not consistently maintained.<ref>Milnes, Rodney. "And lost at sea", The Times, 22 May 1996, p.&nbsp;33.</ref>
Welser-Möst's period as principal conductor coincided with the installation of the LPO as the sole resident orchestra of the Festival Hall. This proved a mixed blessing: the Southbank Centre management now had a say over concert programming, and insisted on the inclusion of works by obscure composers which did severe damage to box-office receipts.<ref name="p208">Pirouet, p.&nbsp;208.</ref> In 1993 another official attempt to create a "super-orchestra" at the expense of one or more of the existing London ensembles briefly damaged relations between the LPO and the Philharmonia, but the idea was quickly abandoned, and in 1995, with the consent of the Arts Council, the two orchestras agreed to share the residency at the Festival Hall.<ref>Pirouet, pp.&nbsp;217–220,&nbsp;and&nbsp;223.</ref>
In the mid-1990s, the LPO released albums as a tribute to rock bands, such as Led Zeppelin, Mike Oldfield and Pink Floyd, with cover versions of songs by them.
In 1993, with the government of South Africa now moving towards majority rule, the orchestra accepted an invitation to tour there.<ref>Pirouet, p.&nbsp;213.</ref> Welser-Möst concluded his LPO tenure in 1996, after what The Guardian called "a fraught few years in which the high hopes placed in him were somehow not fulfilled."<ref>Chancellor, Alexander. "Orchestral manoeuvres", The Guardian, 20 July 1996, p.&nbsp;A24.</ref>
=== 21st century ===
After the departure of Welser-Möst, the LPO was without a principal conductor for four years. During the interregnum, the orchestra inaugurated its "Roots Classical Fusions" series, which aimed to combine musical traditions from around the world; this was part of an education and community programme launched by the orchestra.<ref> urltoken "History", London Philharmonic Orchestra. Retrieved 6 September</ref> Kurt Masur was the LPO's principal conductor from 2000 to 2007. Under Masur, known for his performances of the German symphonic repertoire, the orchestra regained its musical form, and the critic Richard S Ginell commented that Vladimir Jurowski, who took over in 2007 "has inherited an LPO in splendid technical shape, probably having been drilled to a fare-thee-well under Masur".<ref>Ginell, Richard S. "Orchestral Upheavals: Gergiev and Jurowski in London", American Record Guide, July 2008, pp.&nbsp;23–24.</ref>
They participated in the recording of the albums Once (2004), Dark Passion Play (2007) and Imaginaerum (2011) by the symphonic metal band Nightwish.
Jurowski had first conducted the LPO at the Royal Festival Hall in December 2001, as an emergency substitute for Yuri Temirkanov.<ref></ref> Jurowski became principal guest conductor in 2003, and conducted the orchestra in June 2007 during the concerts marking the re-opening of the refurbished Festival Hall.<ref></ref> In September 2007, Jurowski became the LPO's eleventh principal conductor. Like his LPO predecessors Pritchard and Haitink, Jurowski also served as music director of Glyndebourne (2001–2013), where he conducted the LPO there in operas by Britten, Mozart, Puccini, Richard Strauss, Verdi, Wagner, and others. During Jurowski's LPO tenure, principal guest conductors of the LPO have included Yannick Nézet-Séguin<ref></ref> and Andrés Orozco-Estrada. Jurowski is scheduled to conclude his LPO tenure at the close of the 2020-2021 season.
In 2003, Edward Gardner first guest-conducted the LPO. In July 2019, the LPO announced the appointment of Gardner as its next principal conductor, effective with the 2021-2022 season, with an initial contract of five years.<ref></ref> In October 2018, Karina Canellakis first guest-conducted the LPO. In April 2020, the LPO announced the appointment of Canellakis as its new principal guest conductor, the first female conductor ever named to the post, effective from September 2020.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
== Recordings ==
In its early years, the LPO recorded exclusively for Columbia, a division of EMI. The orchestra's first gramophone set was made before its debut concert; with Sargent and the Royal Choral Society the LPO recorded choruses from Messiah and The Creation at Kingsway Hall in September 1932.<ref>Stuart, p.&nbsp;19.</ref> The first Abbey Road recording was in October, under Sir Henry Wood.<ref>Stuart, pp.&nbsp;19–20.</ref> Beecham's first discs with the orchestra were made in January 1933, with his ballet suite The Origin of Design, arranged from music by Handel.<ref>Stuart, p.&nbsp;72</ref> From then until his last LPO recording in December 1945 Beecham recorded ninety-nine 78-rpm sets with the orchestra.<ref name=disco>Stuart, pp.&nbsp;443–450.</ref> Other conductors who worked in the EMI studios with the orchestra in its early years included Elgar, Felix Weingartner, John Barbirolli, and Serge Koussevitzky.<ref name="s2">Stuart, p.&nbsp;2.</ref> Soloists in concerto recordings included the pianists Artur Schnabel and Alfred Cortot and the violinists Fritz Kreisler and Jascha Heifetz.<ref name="s2" />
In 1946 the orchestra began recording for EMI's rival, Decca. The LPO's first recording for the label, Stravinsky's Petrushka, conducted by Ernest Ansermet, was followed by a large number of sessions as the company rebuilt its catalogue after the war.<ref name="decca"/> Among those who recorded with the orchestra for Decca were van Beinum, Sargent, de Sabata, Furtwängler, Charles Munch, Clemens Krauss, Hans Knappertsbusch, Erich Kleiber and the young Solti.<ref name="decca">Stuart, Philip. urltoken Decca Classical, 1929–2009, AHRC Research Centre for the History and Analysis of Recorded Music. Retrieved 5 September 2014.</ref> The orchestra's first stereophonic recording was made for Decca in 1956, with Boult in Vaughan Williams's Eighth Symphony.<ref>Stuart, p.&nbsp;114.</ref>
Unlike its London rivals the RPO and the Philharmonia (both of whom recorded for many years only for EMI and its associates, with the rarest of exceptions), the post-war LPO was not exclusively associated with one company, and as well as Decca it recorded for Philips, CBS, RCA, Chandos and many other labels.<ref>Stuart, p.&nbsp;4.</ref> For some years in the 1950s and 1960s the orchestra was contracted to two companies at once, and consequently appeared under the name "the Philharmonic Promenade Orchestra" in some of its recordings.<ref>Simeone and Mundy, pp.&nbsp;80–96.</ref> In the 1960s and 1970s the orchestra was particularly associated with Lyrita, an independent company specialising in neglected British repertoire.<ref name=decca/> In most LPO recordings for Lyrita the conductor was Boult; in the same period he also recorded extensively for EMI, with the LPO his preferred orchestra.<ref>Stuart, p.&nbsp;140.</ref>
The LPO plays on many opera recordings, some taped live at Glyndebourne and the Festival Hall, and others in the studios of Decca and EMI. They range from early works such as Cavalli's L'Ormindo (recorded 1968) and Glydebourne's staging of Handel's Theodora (1996) to central repertoire such as Così fan tutte (1974), Carmen (1975 and 2002) and Die Meistersinger (2011), and première recordings of 20th-century works including Vaughan Williams's The Pilgrim's Progress (1972), Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk (1979) and Eötvös's Love and Other Demons (2008).<ref> urltoken "CDs and audio" , Glyndebourne.

=== Film scores and other non-classical recordings ===
Although not rivalling the LSO's total of more than 200 film score recordings, the LPO has played for a number of soundtracks, starting in 1936 with Whom the Gods Love. The orchestra played for ten films made during the Second World War, and then did little soundtrack work until the 1970s, with the major exception of Lawrence of Arabia (1962). Later scores have included those for Antony and Cleopatra (1972), Jesus Christ Superstar (1973), Disney's Tron (1982), The Fly (1986), Dead Ringers (1988), In the Name of the Father (1993), the Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001–03) and most of the music for the three films derived from The Hobbit (2012–14).<ref> urltoken "Film highlights", London Philharmonic Orchestra. Retrieved 5 September 2014.</ref>
The orchestra has made many non-classical recordings, including such titles as Hawaiian Paradise (1959), Evita (1976), Broadway Gold (1978), Folk Music of the Region of Asturias (1984), Academy Award Themes (1984), Japanese Light Music (1993), The Symphonic Music of Pink Floyd (1994) and The Symphonic Music of The Who (1995).<ref name="s443">Stuart, p.&nbsp;443–450.</ref> In May 2011 the orchestra recorded the 205 national anthems to be used at medal ceremonies at the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London the following year.<ref> urltoken "London 2012 Hands Baton to London Philharmonic Orchestra", IPC, 15 April 2011.</ref>

== Notes ==

The following year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon, Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.<ref>Mitchell, Donald. urltoken "Promenade Concerts", The Musical Times, October 1953, p.&nbsp;472. </ref> In 1956 the LPO toured the Soviet Union, the first British orchestra to do so; the conductors were Boult, Anatole Fistoulari and George Hurst, and the soloists were Alfredo Campoli and Moura Lympany.<ref>Pepper, Maurice. urltoken "The London Philharmonic Orchestra in Russia", The Musical Times, February 1957, pp.&nbsp;67–69. </ref> After the tour Boult retired as principal conductor, but remained closely associated with the orchestra, and was made its President in 1965. Most of his stereophonic recordings for EMI were made with the LPO.<ref>Simeone and Mundy, pp.&nbsp;81–96; and Pirouet, p.&nbsp;116.</ref>
Through the middle and late 1950s the LPO worked with new conductors including Constantin Silvestri and Josef Krips. This was a bad period financially for the orchestra, and it was forced to abandon fixed contracts for its players with holiday and sick pay and pensions, and revert to payment by engagement.<ref name=moore>Moore (unnumbered page)</ref> Financial disaster was averted thanks to an anonymous benefactor, generally believed to be Boult.<ref>Pirouet, p.&nbsp;119.</ref> A historian of the orchestra, Edmund Pirouet, writes that having been on an upward curve in the 1940s, by the mid-1950s the orchestra "was at best marking time".<ref>Pirouet, p.&nbsp;116.</ref>
In 1958 the LPO appointed William Steinberg, also music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, as chief conductor. He was a noted orchestral trainer, and did much to restore playing standards to their former levels.<ref name="moore" /> Steinberg resigned the LPO post after two seasons, advised by his doctor to restrict his activities.<ref>"Dr Steinberg leaving London Philharmonic", The Guardian, 1 August 1960.</ref>
