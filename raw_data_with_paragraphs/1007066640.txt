Last Judgment

==In the Baha'i Faith==
The Bab and Baha'u'llah taught that there is one unfolding religion of one God and that once in about every 1,000 years a new messenger prophet, Rasul al-Nabii, or as Baha'is call them, Manifestation of God, comes to mankind to renew the Kingdom of God on earth and establish a new Covenant between humanity and God. Each time a new Manifestation of God comes it is considered the Day of Judgment, Day of Resurrection, or 'the Last Hour'<ref></ref> for the believers and unbelievers of the previous Manifestation of God. The Bab told of the judgment:
The Eastern Orthodox and Catholic teachings of the Last Judgment differ only on the exact nature of the in-between state of purgatory/Abraham's Bosom. These differences may only be apparent and not actual due to differing theological terminology and evolving tradition.
====Eastern Orthodoxy====
The Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that there are two judgments: the first, or "Particular" Judgment, is that experienced by each individual at the time of his or her death, at which time God will decide where<ref>The Orthodox do not have an understanding of "Purgatory." Rather, they believe that the souls of the departed will await the Final Judgment either in heaven or hell – but that there are different levels of heaven and different levels of hell – and they believe that the prayers of the Church can help to ease the sufferings of the souls, but do not dogmatize as to how exactly this is accomplished.</ref> one is to spend the time until the Second Coming of Christ (see Hades in Christianity). This judgment is generally believed to occur on the fortieth day after death. The second, "General" or "Final" Judgment will occur after the Second Coming. 
Although in modern times some have attempted to introduce the concept of soul sleep into Orthodox thought about life after death, it has never been a part of traditional Orthodox teaching, and it even contradicts the Orthodox understanding of the intercession of the Saints.
Eastern Orthodoxy teaches that salvation is bestowed by God as a free gift of divine grace, which cannot be earned, and by which forgiveness of sins is available to all. However, the deeds done by each person are believed to affect how he will be judged, following the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats. How forgiveness is to be balanced against behavior is not well-defined in scripture, judgment in the matter being solely Christ's.
Similarly, although Orthodoxy teaches that salvation is obtained only through Christ and his Church, the fate of those outside the Church at the Last Judgment is left to the mercy of God and is not declared.

=====Icons=====
The theme of the Last Judgment is extremely important in Orthodoxy. Traditionally, an Orthodox church will have a fresco or mosaic of the Last Judgment on the back (western) wall so that the faithful, as they leave the services, are reminded that they will be judged by what they do during this earthly life.
The icon of the Last Judgment traditionally depicts Christ Pantokrator, enthroned in glory on a white throne, surrounded by the Theotokos (Virgin Mary), John the Baptist, Apostles, saints and angels. Beneath the throne the scene is divided in half with the "mansions of the righteous" , i.e., those who have been saved, to Jesus' right (the viewer's left), and the torments of those who have been damned to his left. Separating the two is the Lake of fire which proceeds from Jesus' left foot. For more detail, see below.
=====Hymnography=====
The theme of the Last Judgment is found in the funeral and Pannikhida of the Church, and is a major theme in the services during Great Lent. The second Sunday before the beginning of Great Lent is dedicated to the Last Judgment. It is also found in the hymns of the Octoechos used on Saturdays throughout the year.
====Lutheranism====
Lutherans do not believe in any sort of earthly millennial kingdom of Christ either before or after his second coming on the last day.<ref></ref> On the last day,<ref>, </ref> all the dead will be resurrected.<ref>, , , , </ref> Their souls will then be reunited with the same bodies they had before dying.<ref>, , , , , , , </ref> The bodies will then be changed, those of the wicked to a state of everlasting shame and torment,<ref>, , </ref> those of the righteous to an everlasting state of celestial glory.<ref>, , , , , , , </ref> After the resurrection of all the dead,<ref>, , </ref> and the change of those still living,<ref>, </ref> all nations shall be gathered before Christ,<ref>, , , , </ref> and he will separate the righteous from the wicked.<ref>, </ref> Christ will publicly judge<ref>, , , </ref> all people by the testimony of their faith<ref>, , , </ref> – the good works<ref>, , </ref> of the righteous in evidence of their faith,<ref>, , , , , </ref> and the sin of the wicked in evidence of their unbelief.<ref>, , , </ref> He will judge in righteousness<ref>, , </ref> in the presence of all and men and angels,<ref>, </ref> and his final judgement will be just damnation to everlasting punishment for the wicked and a gracious gift of life everlasting to the righteous.<ref>, , , </ref>
===Esoteric Christian tradition===
Although the Last Judgment is preached by a great part of Christian mainstream churches; the Esoteric Christian traditions like the Essenes and Rosicrucians, the Spiritualist movement, and some liberal theologies reject the traditional conception of the Last Judgment, as inconsistent with an all-just and loving God, in favor of some form of universal salvation.
Max Heindel, a Danish-American astrologer and mystic, taught that when the Day of Christ comes, marking the end of the current fifth or Aryan epoch, the human race will have to pass a final examination or last judgment, where, as in the Days of Noah,<ref>Max Heindel, urltoken The Days of Noah and of Christ in Teachings of an Initiate (posthumous publication of collected works), .</ref> the chosen ones or pioneers, the sheep, will be separated from the goats or stragglers,<ref>Cf. </ref> by being carried forward into the next evolutionary period, inheriting the ethereal conditions of the New Galilee in the making. Nevertheless, it is emphasized that all beings of the human evolution will ultimately be saved in a distant future as they acquire a superior grade of consciousness and altruism. At the present period, the process of human evolution is conducted by means of successive rebirths in the physical world<ref>Max Heindel, The Rosicrucian Christianity Lectures ( urltoken The Riddle of Life and Death), 1908, </ref> and the salvation is seen as being mentioned in Revelation 3:12 (KJV), which states "Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out". However, this western esoteric tradition states – like those who have had a near-death experience – that after the death of the physical body, at the end of each physical lifetime and after the life review period (which occurs before the silver cord is broken), a judgment occurs, more akin to a Final Review or End Report over one's life, where the life of the subject is fully evaluated and scrutinized.<ref>Max Heindel, urltoken Death and Life in Purgatory – urltoken Life and Activity in Heaven</ref> This judgment is seen as being mentioned in Hebrews 9:27, which states that "it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment".

In art, the Last Judgment is a common theme in medieval and renaissance religious iconography. Like most early iconographic innovations, its origins stem from Byzantine art, although it was a much less common subject than in the West during the Middle Ages.<ref>Remarkably, only three Byzantine icons of the subject survive, all at St Catherine's Monastery. Daly, 252</ref> In Western Christianity, it is often the subject depicted in medieval cathedrals and churches, either outside on the central Pediment of the entrance or inside on the (rear) west wall, so that the congregation attending church saw the image on either entering of leaving. 
In the 15th century it also appeared as the central section of a triptych on altarpieces, with the side panels showing heaven and hell, as in the Beaune Altarpiece or a triptych by Hans Memling. The usual composition has Christ seated high in the centre, flanked by angels, the Virgin Mary, and John the Evangelist who are supplicating on behalf of those being judged (in what is called a Deesis group in Orthodoxy). Saint Michael is often shown, either weighing the deceased on scales or directing matters, and there might be a large crowd of saints, angels, and the saved around the central group.
At the bottom of the composition a crowd of the deceased are shown, often with some rising from their graves. These are being sorted and directed by angels into the saved and the damned. Almost always the saved are on the viewer's left (so on the right hand of Christ), and the damned on the right. The saved are led up to heaven, often shown as a fortified gateway, while the damned are handed over to devils who herd them down into hell on the right; the composition therefore has a circular pattern of movement. Often the damned disappear into a Hellmouth, the mouth of a huge monster, an image of Anglo-Saxon origin. The damned often include figures of high rank, wearing crowns, mitres, and often the Papal tiara during the lengthy periods when there were antipopes, or in Protestant depictions. There may be detailed depictions of the torments of the damned.
The most famous Renaissance depiction is Michelangelo Buonarroti's The Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel. Included in this fresco is his self-portrait, as Bartholomew's flayed skin.<ref></ref>
The image in Eastern Orthodox icons has a similar composition, but usually less space is devoted to hell, and there are often a larger number of scenes; the Orthodox readiness to label figures with inscriptions often allows more complex compositions. There is more often a large group of saints around Christ (which may include animals), and the hetoimasia or "empty throne", containing a cross, is usually shown below Christ, often guarded by archangels; figures representing Adam and Eve may kneel below it or below Christ. A distinctive feature of the Orthodox composition, especially in Russian icons, is a large band leading like a chute from the feet of Christ down to hell; this may resemble a striped snake or be a "river of Fire" coloured flame red. If it is shown as a snake, it attempts to bite Adam on the heel but, as he is protected by Christ, is unsuccessful.

===Swedenborgian===
Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) had a revelation that the church has gone through a series of Last Judgments. First, during Noah's Flood, then Moses on Mount Sinai, Jesus' crucifixion, and finally in 1757, which is the final Last Judgment. These occur in a realm outside earth and heaven, and are spiritual in nature.
==In Islam==
According to Islamic eschatology, the Day of Resurrection (yawm al-qiyāmah) <ref> aka "the Day of Judgment" (yawm ad-din)</ref> is believed to be God's final assessment of humanity. The sequence of events (according to the most commonly held belief) is the annihilation of all creatures, resurrection of the body, and the judgment of all sentient creatures. It is a time where everyone would be shown his or her deeds and actions with justice.
The exact time when these events will occur is unknown, however there are said to be major<ref></ref> and minor signs<ref></ref> which are to occur near the time of Qiyammah (end time). It is believed that prior to the time of Qiyammah, two dangerous, evil tribes called Yajooj and Majooj are released from a dam-resembling wall that Allah makes stronger everyday. Other signs are mentioned like the blowing of the first trumpet by an archangel Israfil, and the coming of rain of mercy that will cause humans to grow from a tiny part of their tailbone, which was said to never degenerate, even in the grave, despite the decay of the human body.<ref> urltoken How is it possible that the coccyx does not decay at all? What if the body was cremated? Islam Stack Exchange</ref> Many verses of the Quran, especially the earlier ones, are dominated by the idea of the nearing of the Day of Resurrection.<ref name="EoQ">Isaac Hasson, Last Judgment, Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an</ref><ref name="EoI">L. Gardet, Qiyama, Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an</ref>
Belief in Judgment Day is considered a fundamental tenet of faith by all Muslims. It is one of the six articles of faith. The trials and tribulations associated with it are detailed in both the Quran and the hadith, sayings of Muhammad. Hence they were added in the commentaries of the Islamic expositors and scholarly authorities such as al-Ghazali, Ibn Kathir, Ibn Majah, Muhammad al-Bukhari, and Ibn Khuzaymah who explain them in detail. Every human, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, is believed to be held accountable for their deeds and are believed to be judged by God accordingly.
==In Judaism==
In Judaism, beliefs vary about a last day of judgment for all mankind. Some rabbis hold that there will be such a day following the resurrection of the dead. Others hold that this accounting and judgment happens when one dies. Still others hold that the last judgment only applies to the gentiles and not the Jewish people.<ref></ref>
==In Zoroastrianism==
Frashokereti is the Zoroastrian doctrine of a final renovation of the universe, when evil will be destroyed, and everything else will be then in perfect unity with God (Ahura Mazda). 
The doctrinal premises are (1) good will eventually prevail over evil; (2) creation was initially perfectly good, but was subsequently corrupted by evil; (3) the world will ultimately be restored to the perfection it had at the time of creation; (4) the "salvation for the individual depended on the sum of that person's thoughts, words and deeds, and there could be no intervention, whether compassionate or capricious, by any divine being to alter this." Thus, each human bears responsibility for their own fate, and simultaneously shares in the responsibility for the fate of the world.<ref name="Boyce">.</ref>
==Crack of doom==
In English, crack of doom is an old term used for the Day of Judgement, referring in particular to the blast of trumpets signalling the end of the world in Chapter 8 of the Book of Revelation. A "crack" had the sense of any loud noise, preserved in the phrase "crack of thunder",<ref>OED, "Crack"</ref> and "doom" was a term for the Last Judgement, as End time still is.
The phrase is famously used by William Shakespeare in Macbeth, where on the heath the Three Witches show Macbeth the line of kings that will issue from Banquo: 
:"Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!
:What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom? 
:Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more." (Act 4, scene 1, 112–117)
The meaning was that Banquo's line will endure until the Judgement Day, flattery for King James I, who claimed descent from Banquo.

The Last Judgment, Final Judgment, Day of Reckoning, Day of Judgment, Judgment Day, Doomsday or The Day of the Lord , or is part of the eschatology of the Abrahamic religions and in the Frashokereti of Zoroastrianism.
Some Christian denominations consider the Second Coming of Christ to be the final and infinite judgment by God of the people of every nation<ref> urltoken Catholic Encyclopedia: General Judgment: "Few truths are more often or more clearly proclaimed in Scripture than that of the general judgment. To it the prophets of the Old Testament refer when they speak of the 'Day of the Lord' ; ;93-231700-6 register Holy BIBLE service name number Jermaine Thomas McCoy 93-231700-6 , in which the nations will be summoned to judgment by the Fathers. In the New Testament the Parousia, or coming of Christ as Judge of the world, is an oft-repeated doctrine. The Saviour Himself not only foretells the event but graphically portrays its circumstances sqq.;SGT john 1:18 Parish all world threw Justice hall Dean Jermaine Thomas McCoy sqq.). The Apostles Malachi peter phophet labour give a most prominent place to this doctrine in their preaching ; and writings ; ; ; ; ; ; . Besides the name Parusia (parousia), or Advent ; , the Second Coming is also called Epiphany, epiphaneia, or Appearance ; ; ; , and Apocalypse (apokalypsis), or Revelation ; . The time of the Second Coming is spoken of as "that Day" , "the day of the Lord" , "the day of Christ" , "the day of the Son of Man" , "the last day" . Belief in the general judgment has prevailed at all times and in all places within the Church. It is contained as an article of faith in all the ancient creeds: "He ascended into heaven. From thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead" (Apostles' Creed). "The two shall come again with glory to judge both the living and the dead" (Nicene Creed). "From thence they shall come to judge the living and the dead, at whose coming all men must rise with their bodies and are to render an account of their deeds" (Athanasian Creed). Relying on the authority of Papias, several Church Fathers of the first four centuries advanced the theory of a millennium' terrestrial reign of Christ with the saints to precede the end of the World. Although this idea is interwoven with the eschatological teachings of those writers, it in no way detracted from their belief in a universal world-judgment. Patristic testimony to this dogma is clear and unanimous."

resulting in the approval of some and the penalizing of others. The concept is found in all the canonical gospels, particularly the Gospel of Matthew. Christian Futurists believe it will take place after the Universal resurrection and the Second Coming of Christ while Full Preterism believe it has already occurred. The Last Judgment has inspired numerous artistic depictions.
