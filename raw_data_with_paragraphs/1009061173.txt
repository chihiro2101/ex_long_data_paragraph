Great spotted woodpecker

== Taxonomy ==
Woodpeckers are an ancient bird family consisting of three subfamilies, the wrynecks, the piculets and the true woodpeckers, Picinae. The largest of the five tribes within the Picinae is Melanerpini, the pied woodpeckers, a group which includes the great spotted woodpecker. Within the genus Dendrocopus the great spotted woodpecker's closest relatives are the Himalayan, Sind, Syrian, white-winged woodpeckers and the Darjeeling woodpecker.<ref name=shakya></ref> The great spotted woodpecker has been recorded as hybridising with the Syrian woodpecker.<ref name=IUCN/>
The great spotted woodpecker was described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae as Picus major.<ref name=Linn></ref> It was moved to its current genus, Dendrocopus, by the German naturalist Carl Ludwig Koch in 1816.<ref></ref> The genus name Dendrocopus is a combination of the Greek words dendron , "tree", and kopos, "striking". The specific major is from Latin maior, "greater".<ref name=job></ref>
=== Subspecies ===
Recognised subspecies vary by author from as few as 14 to nearly 30. This is largely because changes are clinal with many intermediate forms. However, mitochondrial DNA data suggests that the Caspian Sea region's Dendrocopus major poelzami, Japanese D. m. japonicus and Chinese D. m. cabanisi may all merit full species status. Despite its distinctive appearance, D. m. canariensis from Tenerife in the Canary Islands appears to be closely related to the nominate subspecies D. m. major.<ref name="hbw"></ref><ref name= gorman>Gorman (2014) pp. 265–267.</ref>
The chronospecies D. m. submajor lived during the Middle Pleistocene Riss glaciation (250,000 to 300,000 years ago) when it was found in Europe south of the ice sheet. It is sometimes treated as a distinct species, but did not differ significantly from the extant great spotted woodpecker, whose European subspecies are probably its direct descendants.<ref name=Mlikovsky></ref><ref name=Mourer-Chauvire></ref>
== Description ==
An adult great spotted woodpecker is long, weighs and has a wingspan.<ref name= "hbw"/><ref name=Jonsson/> The upperparts are glossy blue-black, with white on the sides of the face and neck. Black lines run from the shoulder to the nape, the base of the bill and about halfway across the breast. There is a large white shoulder patch and the flight feathers are barred with black and white, as is the tail. The underparts are white other than a scarlet lower belly and undertail. The bill is slate-black, the legs greenish-grey and the eye is deep red. Males have a crimson patch on the nape, which is absent from the otherwise similar females. Juvenile birds are less glossy than adults and have a brown tinge to their upperparts and dirty white underparts. Their markings are less well-defined than the adult's and the lower belly is pink rather than red. The crown of the juvenile's head is red, less extensively in young females than males.<ref name= "hbw"/>
The various subspecies differ in plumage, the general pattern being that northern forms are larger, heavier-billed and whiter beneath, as predicted by Bergmann's rule, so north Eurasian D. m. major and D. m. kamtschaticus are large and strikingly white, whereas D. m. hispanicus in Iberia and D. m. harterti in Corsica and Sardinia are somewhat smaller and have darker underparts. D. m. canariensis and D. m. thanneri in the Canary Islands are similar to the Iberian race but have contrasting white flanks. In Morocco, D. m. mauritanus is pale below with red in the centre of its breast, and birds breeding at higher altitudes are larger and darker than those lower in the hills. D. m. numidus in Algeria and Tunisia is very distinctive, with a breast band of red-tipped black feathers. Caspian D. m. poelzami is small, relatively long-billed and has brown underparts. D. m. japonicus of Japan has less white on its shoulders but more in its wings. The two Chinese forms, D. m. cabanisi and D. m. stresemanni, have brownish heads and underparts, and often some red on the breast. Both races have increasingly dark underparts towards the south of their respective ranges.<ref name= "hbw"/>
Some other species in its genus are similar to the great spotted woodpecker. The Syrian woodpecker lacks its relative's black cheek bar and has whiter underparts and paler red underparts,<ref name=bme></ref> although juvenile great spotted woodpeckers often have an incomplete cheek bar, so can potentially be misidentified as Syrian. The white-winged woodpecker has a far more extensive white wing patch than the great spotted woodpecker.<ref name=gorman/> The Sind woodpecker is very similar to the Syrian species, and can be distinguished from great spotted woodpecker in the same way.<ref name=bme/>
=== Moult ===
Adult great spotted woodpeckers have a complete moult after the breeding season which takes about 120&nbsp;days. Northern D. m. major starts its moult from mid-June to late July and finishes in October or November, temperate races like D. m. pinetorum are earlier, commencing in early June to mid-July and completing in mid-September to late October, and southern D. m. hispanicus starts late May or June and finishes as early as August. Juveniles have a partial moult, retaining some of the wing coverts but replacing body, tail and primary feathers. This moult to near-adult plumage starts from late May to early August and finishes from mid-September to late November, timing varying with latitude as with the adults.<ref name=cramp></ref>
=== Voice ===
The call of the great spotted woodpecker is a sharp kik, which may be repeated as a wooden rattling krrarraarr if the bird is disturbed. The courtship call, gwig, is mostly given in the display flight. Drumming on dead trees and branches, and sometimes suitable man-made structures,<ref name ="hbw"/> serves to maintain contact between paired adults and to advertise ownership of territory.<ref name=BWP/>
Both sexes drum, although the male does so much more often, mostly from mid-January until the young are fledged.<ref name ="hbw"/> The far-carrying drumming is faster than for any other woodpecker in its range at around 10–16&nbsp;strikes per second,<ref name =BWP/> typically in one-second bursts, although repeated frequently.<ref name="brazil"></ref> As late as the early twentieth century it was thought that the drumming might be a vocalisation, and it was not until 1943 that it was finally proved to be purely mechanical.<ref name= Cocker ></ref>
== Distribution and habitat ==
The species ranges across Eurasia from the British Isles to Japan, and in North Africa from Morocco to Tunisia; it is absent only from those areas too cold or dry to have suitable woodland habitat.<ref name =gorman/> It is found in a wide variety of woodlands, broadleaf, Pinophyta or mixed, and in modified habitats like parks, gardens and olive groves. It occurs from sea level to the tree line, up to in Europe, in Morocco and in Central Asia.<ref name="hbw"/>
The great spotted woodpecker is mainly resident year round, but sizeable movements can occur when there are shortages of pine and spruce cones in the north of the range.<ref name=Jonsson></ref> Highland populations often descend to lower altitudes in winter. Juveniles also have a tendency to wander some distance from where they were hatched, often as far as , sometimes up to .<ref name="hbw"/> Vagrants have reached the Faroe Islands, Hong Kong and Iceland,<ref name= IUCN/> and there are several sightings from North America in at least the Aleutian Islands, Pribilof Islands and Alaska.<ref name="hbw"/>
Due to deforestation, this woodpecker was extirpated in Ireland in the seventeenth century,<ref name= gordon></ref> but the island has been naturally recolonised, with the first proven nesting in County Down in 2007.<ref name=INJ></ref> Its expansion in range is continuing, with breeding proven or suspected in at least 10 counties by 2013, with the main concentration in Down and County Wicklow.<ref name=IRBBP></ref> Genetic evidence shows the birds to be of British, rather than Scandinavian, ancestry, with the populations in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic having separate origins.<ref name= mcdevitt></ref> The great spotted woodpecker was also found to have been nesting in the Isle of Man from 2009.<ref name= mcdevitt/>
== Behaviour ==
The great spotted woodpecker spends much of its time climbing trees, and has adaptations to this lifestyle, many of which are shared by other woodpecker species. These include the zygodactyl arrangement of the foot, with two toes facing forward and two back,<ref name=gorman18>Gorman (2014) p. 18.</ref> and the stiff tail feathers that are used as a prop against the trunk. In most birds the bones of the tail diminish in size towards its end, but this does not occur in woodpeckers, and the final vertebra, the pygostyle, is very large to anchor the strong tail muscles.<ref name=grouw/>
The hammering of woodpeckers when drumming or feeding creates great forces which are potentially damaging to the birds.<ref name=gibson></ref> In the great spotted woodpecker and most of its relatives, the hinge where the front of the skull connects with the upper mandible is folded inwards, tensioned by a muscle that braces it against the shock of the impact when the bill is hammering on hard wood.<ref name=grouw/> The outer layer of the upper mandible is significantly longer than the more rigid lower mandible and absorbs much of the concussive force.<ref name= wang></ref> Skeletal adaptations and strengthening also help to absorb the shock, and narrow nostrils protect against flying debris.<ref name=grouw/>
As well as using holes for breeding, great spotted woodpeckers roost at night, and sometimes during the day, in old nest cavities, excavated by other woodpeckers. They will occasionally make a new roosting hole or use an artificial site such as a nest box.<ref name= PJE></ref>
=== Breeding ===
Great spotted woodpeckers are strongly territorial, typically occupying areas of about year-round,<ref name= burton></ref> which are defended mainly by the male, a behaviour which attracts females. Pairs are monogamy during the breeding period, but often change partners before the next season.<ref name= bwpupdate></ref>
Sexual maturity is attained at an age of one year; courtship behaviour commences in the following December. The male has a fluttering flight display with shallow wingbeats and a spread tail. He calls in flight and may land at a prospective nest-site.<ref name="hbw"/> The female may initiate mating and will occasionally mount the male, this reverse mounting typically preceding normal copulation.<ref name= BB113></ref>
The pair excavate a new hole at least above the ground and usually lower than , although sometimes much higher. The chosen site is normally a tree, alive or dead, occasionally a utility pole or nest box. Old holes are rarely re-used,<ref name="hbw"/> although the same tree may be used for nesting for several years.<ref name= bwpupdate/><ref name= BB87></ref> The nest cavity is deep with an entrance hole wide. It is excavated by both sexes, the male doing most of the chiselling.<ref name="hbw"/> As with other woodpeckers, the hole is unlined, although wood chips from the excavation may cover the base of the cavity.<ref name=Gorman20>Gorman (2014) pp. 20–22.</ref>
Trees chosen for nest holes have soft heartwood and tough sapwood, the former often due to parasites or diseases that weaken the tree's core. It is not certain how suitable trees are selected, although it may be by drumming, since woods with differing elastic modulus and density may transmit sound at different speeds. A Japanese study found nests in trees from many families; these included grey alder, Betula platyphylla, Ostrya japonica, Syringa reticulata, willows, Japanese larch and Prunus sargentii. The Mongolian oak and Acer pictum were rarely if ever used.<ref name = matsuoka2008></ref>
The typical clutch is four to six glossy white eggs that measure and weigh about , of which 7% is shell.<ref name=BWP></ref><ref name = BTO></ref> They are laid from mid-April to June, the later dates being for birds breeding in the north of the range or at altitude.<ref name="hbw"/> The eggs are incubated by either adult during the day and by the male at night,<ref name= bwpupdate/><ref name = BTO/> for 10–12 days before hatching. Both birds brood and feed the altricial naked chicks and keep the nest clean. The young fledge in 20–23 days from hatching. Each parent then takes responsibility for feeding part of the brood for about ten days, during which time they normally remain close to the nest tree.<ref name="hbw"/>
There is only one brood per year. The survival rates for adults and young are unknown, as is the average lifespan, but the maximum known age is just over 11 years.<ref name = BTO/>
=== Feeding ===
The great spotted woodpecker is omnivore. It digs beetle larvae from trees and also takes many other invertebrates including adult beetles, ants and spiders. The bird also digs for Lepidoptera larvae like Acronicta rumicis.<ref>Vogrin, M., 2002. Breeding birds in hop fields. Ornis Svecica, 12, pp.92–94.</ref> Crustaceans, molluscs and carrion may be eaten, and bird feeders are visited for seeds, suet and domestic scraps.<ref name="hbw"/> The nests of other cavity-nesting birds, such as tits, may be raided for their eggs and chicks;<ref name=BWP/> nest boxes may be similarly attacked, holes being pecked to admit entrance by the woodpecker where necessary.<ref></ref> House martin colonies can be destroyed in repeated visits.<ref name=Cocker/>
Fat-rich plant products such as nuts and conifer seeds are particularly important as winter food in the north of the woodpecker's range, and can then supply more than 30% of the bird's energy requirements. Other plant items consumed include buds, berries and tree sap,<ref name="hbw"/> the latter obtained by drilling rings of holes around a tree trunk.<ref name=BWP/>
The species feeds at all levels of a tree, usually alone, but sometimes as a pair. It will use an "anvil" on which to hammer hard items, particularly pine, spruce, and larch cones, but also fruit, nuts, and hard-bodied insects.<ref name="hbw"/>
Easily accessible items are picked off the tree surface or from fissures in the bark, but larvae are extracted by chiselling holes up to deep and trapping the soft insect with the tongue, which can extend to beyond the bill, and is covered with bristles and sticky saliva to trap the prey.<ref name=BWP/> The woodpecker is able to extend its tongue so far because the hyoid bone to which it is attached has long flexible "horns" that wind around the skull and can move forward when required.<ref name= grouw></ref><ref name= newgen></ref>
== Predators and parasites ==
Woodland bird of prey such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk and the northern goshawk hunt the great spotted woodpecker.<ref name= bialow></ref> This woodpecker is a host of the blood-feeding fly Carnus hemapterus, and its internal parasites may include the Acanthocephala Prosthorhynchus transversus. Protozoans also occur,<ref name=roth></ref> including the potentially fatal Toxoplasma gondii, which causes toxoplasmosis.<ref name=joke></ref> The great spotted woodpecker is the favoured host of the cestoda Anomotaenia brevis.<ref name= combes></ref>
== Status ==
The total population for the great spotted woodpecker is estimated at 73.7–110.3&nbsp;million individuals, with 35% of the population in Europe. The breeding range is estimated as , and the population is considered overall to be large and apparently stable or slightly increasing, especially in Britain, where the population has recently overspilled into Ireland. For this reason the great spotted woodpecker is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN.<ref name=IUCN /><ref name="hbw" />
Breeding densities have been recorded as between 0.1–6.6&nbsp;pairs/10&nbsp;ha (0.04–2.7&nbsp;pairs/10&nbsp;acres), with the greatest densities in mature forest growing on alluvium. Numbers have increased in Europe due to the planting of forests, which provides breeding habitat, and more available dead wood, and this species has profited from its flexibility with regard to types of woodland and its ability to thrive in proximity to humans. Harsh winters are a problem, and fragmentation of woodland can cause local difficulties. The Canary Islands populations of D. m. canariensis on Tenerife and D. m. thanneri on Gran Canaria face a potential threat from the exploitation of the local pine forests.<ref name="hbw" />

The great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major) is a medium-sized woodpecker with pied black and white plumage and a red patch on the lower belly. Males and young birds also have red markings on the neck or head. This species is found across the Palearctic including parts of North Africa. Across most of its range it is resident, but in the north some will migrate if the conifer cone crop fails. Some individuals have a tendency to wander, leading to the recent recolonisation of Ireland and to vagrancy to North America. Great spotted woodpeckers chisel into trees to find food or excavate nest holes, and also drum for contact and territorial advertisement; like other woodpeckers, they have anatomy adaptations to manage the physical stresses from the hammering action. This species is similar to the Syrian woodpecker.
This woodpecker occurs in all types of woodlands and eats a variety of foods, being capable of extracting seeds from pine cones, insect larvae from inside trees or eggs and chicks of other birds from their nests. It breeds in holes excavated in living or dead trees, unlined apart from wood chips. The typical clutch is four to six glossy white eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs, feed the chicks, and keep the nest clean. When the young fledge they are fed by the adults for about ten days, each parent taking responsibility for feeding part of the brood.
The species is closely related to some other members of its genus. It has a number of subspecies, some of which are distinctive enough to be potential new species. It has a huge range and large population, with no widespread threats, so it is classed as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
