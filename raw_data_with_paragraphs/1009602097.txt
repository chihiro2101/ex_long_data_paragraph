Star Control II

==Gameplay==
Star Control II is an action-adventure science fiction game, set in an open universe.<ref name="bestclassic2"></ref> It features ship-to-ship combat based on the original Star Control, but removes the first game's strategy gameplay to focus on story and dialog, as seen in other adventure games.<ref name="HG101series2"></ref> The player's goal is to free Earth from the evil Ur-Quan, by recruiting aliens to help.<ref name=":02"></ref> The main gameplay elements are exploring the galaxy, gathering resources, building a fleet, defeating enemy ships, and conversing with aliens.<ref name=":12"></ref><ref name=":42"></ref>
One-on-one spaceship battles take place in real-time, based on the core gameplay of the original Star Control.<ref name=":22"></ref> Each ship has unique weapons, maneuvers, and secondary abilities,<ref name=":02" /> and winning a battle requires a combination of ship selection and skill.<ref name=":12" /> This combat mode can be played separately in a two-player battle mode called Super Melee.<ref name="Bycer20182"></ref> In the story mode, the player is limited to the ships they can gain from sympathetic alien races, whereas Super Melee includes every ship in both Star Control games.<ref name="HG101series2" /> The only ship unique to the story mode is the player's capital ship, which is upgraded as the player gains new technology and resources.<ref name="Bycer20182" />
After a brief opening sequence, the player is given near total freedom to explore the galaxy at large.<ref name=":42" /> Exploration often involves travelling to stars, landing on planets, and gathering resources.<ref name=":12" /> The player navigates their star map, with over 500 stars and 3800 planets to potentially visit.<ref name=":32"></ref> Players must manage their risk as they explore, as planets with more dangerous hazards usually feature more valuable resources, which are vital to upgrade the player's fleet.<ref name="Bycer20182" /> More rarely, a planet will feature an interactive alien race, who the player can engage with as a potential friend or foe.<ref name=":12" /> The interactive dialog options help advance the story, with branching conversations similar to other adventure games.<ref name="HG101series2" /> These conversations also reveal secrets and information about the galaxy.<ref name=":12" /> The game vastly expands on the characters and backstory from the first game, with each species having their own characteristic conversational quirks, music, and even display fonts.<ref name="HG101series2" />
== Plot ==
Whereas the first Star Control stores most of its lore in the instruction manual, Star Control II continues the story with a rich in-game experience, playing through events after the Alliance is defeated by the Hierarchy.<ref name="HG101series2" /> In the last phase of the war between the Alliance of Free Stars and the Hierarchy of Battle Thralls, an Earthling ship discovered an ancient Precursor subterranean installation in the Vela star system. A massive Hierarchy offensive forced the Alliance fleets to retreat beyond Vela, stranding the science expedition, who went in to hiding. Decades later, with the help of a genius child born on the planet, the colonists activated the Precursor machinery and found out that it was programmed to build a highly advanced but unfinished starship, which could be piloted only by the now grown genius child, who alone could interact with the Precursor central computer. The new ship set out to Sol to make contact with Earth, but shortly before reaching Sol the little fleet was attacked by an unknown probe; The expedition commander, captaining the expedition's Earthling Cruiser, intercepted the alien ship before it could damage the defenseless Precursor starship, but was killed in the short fight, leaving the genius young man in command.<ref></ref>
The player begins the game as the commander of the Precursor starship, who returns to Earth to find it enslaved by the Ur-Quan. The Captain gains the support of the skeleton crew of Earth's caretaker starbase and ventures out to contact the other races to find out what's happened since the end of the war and try to recruit allies in to a New Alliance of Free Stars against the Ur-Quan. The Captain quickly discovers that the rest of the humans' allies in the war against the Ur-Quan have either been eradicated, put under slave shields, or put into service as Ur-Quan battle thralls. As the player progresses, it is revealed that the Ur-Quan are fighting an internecine war with the Kohr-Ah, a subspecies of Ur-Quan who believe in eradicating all life in the galaxy, as opposed to enslaving it. The winner of this war will gain access to the Sa-Matra, a Precursor battle platform of unparalleled power. The player must take advantage of the Ur-Quans' distraction to contact and recruit alien races into a new alliance, gather resources and build a fleet, and find a way to destroy the invincible Sa-Matra, before the Ur-Quan finish their war and become unstoppable.
The Captain resolves issues several of the races are facing, or exploits their weaknesses, to get them on side. Notably the Captain finds the Chenjesu and Mmrnmhrm on Procyon undergoing their own plan to merge in to a composite species powerful enough to defeat the Ur-Quan, and captures a psychic alien Dnyarri, which the Captain discovers is a member of the race that brutally enslaved the galaxy millennia ago, causing the Ur-Quan's hegemonic and genocidal rampage around the galaxy. The Captain uses a precursor Sun Device to accelerate the merging of the Chenjesu and Mmrnmhrm to create the Chmmr, who amplify a precursor terraforming bomb, allowing the Captain to sacrifice his ship to destroy the Sa-Matra and defeat the Ur-Quan.
==Development==
=== Concept ===
Star Control II began as a more ambitious project than the original Star Control, with Reiche and Ford hoping to go beyond ship combat to develop a "science fiction adventure role-playing game".<ref name="Barton2016" /> The team credits the pre-existing combat from the original Star Control with giving them a strong core to build a larger game around.<ref name="GDC2015" /> The sequel would develop into a much more detailed adventure than the first edition.<ref name="HG101series2" /> Ford explains that the original Star Control had "some story there, but it was mostly in the manual. In Star Control II, we made a conscious decision to tell more of a story".<ref name="Barton2016" /> The duo would downplay the scale of the game when pitching it to their publisher Accolade, and the game's development would eventually go over schedule.<ref name="GDC2015" />
Reiche and Ford drew inspiration from many science-fiction authors, as well as peers in the game industry. A few years earlier, Reiche had been friends with Greg Johnson during the creation of Starflight, inspiring Reiche to offer creative input on Johnson's expansive science fiction game.<ref name="escapist-20102"></ref> Once Reiche and Ford conceived Star Control 2, they would draw large inspiration from Starflight.<ref name="GDC2015" /> This friendship and mutual admiration led them to even hire Greg Johnson, who they credit as "one of the most significant contributors to Star Control II".<ref name="gamespotinterview" /> Ford also cites their shared love author Jack Vance from their childhood, and were intrigued by the idea of exaggerated societies taken to their extremes, and intelligent characters committed to an interesting agenda.<ref name="GDC2015" /> Reiche would cite the influence of numerous fiction authors over the Star Control series, including Jack Vance, Orson Scott Card, Robert Heinlein, David Brin, and Andre Norton.<ref name="gamespotinterview" /> David Brin's Uplift Universe and Larry Niven's Known Space series are often mentioned as inspiration for Star Control II.<ref name="Tringham2014" />
=== Technology ===
The creators started by asking "what people do when they go out and have an adventure in space", while keeping in mind what they could actually implement.<ref name="warstories"></ref> This led them to create numerous stars and planets, through a combination of procedural generation and handcrafted assets.<ref name="Bycer20182" /> Despite the fact that exoplanets had yet to be fully discovered,<ref name = "warstories"/> Reiche initially took on the challenge of simulating planetary systems based on scientific principles.<ref></ref> They ultimately decided to bypass some details of the simulation, due to its lack of distinct planets to explore.<ref name="DeMaria2018"/> Instead, they imagined cracked planets with magma chasms, ruby planets with precious zirconium, and even rainbow colored planets.<ref name = "warstories"/> The planets were created with a procedurally generated height map, which required difficult programming solutions to simulate the appearance of a 3D sphere.<ref name = "GDC2015"/> They additionally simulated 3D asteroids by digitizing images of pumice they had taken from a parking lot.<ref name = "GDC2015"/>
The Star Control II team also invented their own fictional, flat version of space, so that the stars could be arranged in a more clear and interesting way.<ref name = "GDC2015"/> The algorithmically-assisted generation of the star map helped to create a vast, mysterious setting for players to explore.<ref></ref> The map also added circles of influence for the aliens, not just to describe their location, but to provide narrative hints about their changing power, relationships, and stories.<ref name = "GDC2015"/>
=== Fictional universe ===
Reiche and Ford wanted their new game to further investigate their self-described "superficial" stories and aliens from the original Star Control.<ref name = "warstories"/> Thus, the story for Star Control II would greatly expand on those original characters, and add a few more.<ref name="Barton2016"></ref>
This was the last time that Reiche would design a game using pen and paper, including dozens of flow charts for the major plot points, player choices, and dialog trees.<ref name=":5"></ref> Paul Reiche III describes this creative process, "I know it probably sounds weird, but when I design a game like this, I make drawings of the characters and stare at them. I hold little conversations with them. What do you guys do?' And they tell me."<ref name="DeMaria2018"></ref> Early in the process, they used the first game's character and ship images to create simple visual stories about the two main sides of the conflict.<ref name="Barton2016"/> The main antagonist the Ur Quan were already understood as a race of slavers in Star Control, so Reiche developed their motivation by writing their backstory as slaves themselves.<ref name="DeMaria2018"/> To justify the Mycon's organic structures and high energy plasma, they decided that the Mycon lived beneath the planet's crust, and must have been artificially created to survive there.<ref name="Barton2016"/> Fred Ford inspired the character design for the Earth starbase commander, as well as the Pkunk's insult ability, while the Spathi were inspired by a running joke about Paul Reiche's desire for self-preservation.<ref name="Barton2016"/> The rich storytelling was a contrast to the first game's emphasis on player versus player combat, but they realized that their combat artificial intelligence could give story-loving players an option to delegate battles.<ref name = "GDC2015"/>
Once Reiche and Ford imagined the different alien personalities, Reiche hand-drew a flow chart for each alien's dialog options, which Ford would implement into the game with placeholder tags.<ref name=":5" /> However, the sheer quantity of writing and art proved to be challenging for the game's epic scale.<ref name="gamespotinterview"></ref> Fred Ford surprised the team with his prolific coding, and it was the rest of the team who needed to catch-up with art, writing, music, and other assets.<ref name = "GDC2015"/> They quickly enlisted the help of friends and family to create game content.<ref name=gamespotinterview/> One crucial friend was Starflight creator Greg Johnson, who Reiche had previously helped on Starflight while sharing office space.<ref name = "GDC2015"/> Johnson ended up writing dialog for several aliens, as well as creating most of the artwork for the alien spaceships.<ref></ref> They were also able to hire fantasy artist George Barr through mutual friends,<ref></ref><ref></ref> who had inspired the game's "pulp magazine" feel, and happened to be living nearby.<ref name = "GDC2015"/> Long-time friend Erol Otus was another collaborator, who Reiche describes as contributing the widest range of content, including music, text, art, illustrations for the game manual, and (later) voice-acting.<ref name = "GDC2015"/>
The largest number of collaborators were needed for the game's numerous dialog options.<ref name = "GDC2015"/> The creators were admirers of the Monkey Island games, and aimed to achieve the same level of player choice and humor.<ref name="DeMaria2018"/> Reiche felt that each character needed their own font to match their distinct personality, and built a font-editing system to achieve this.<ref name = "GDC2015"/>
=== Deadline and budget ===
Reiche and Ford felt it was difficult to maintain Accolade's interest in the game.<ref name="gamespotinterview" /> In fact, Accolade had played a version of the game with placeholder dialog, and was content to ship the game with the "cryptic" text as-is.<ref name=":5" /> This led to an industry legend that the duo absconded to Alaska to finish the game without Accolade's interference.<ref></ref> However, the creators later clarified that Accolade did not interfere with development and was satisfied to publish the game in any form, and that this was important to their creative freedom and artistic success.<ref name="Barton2016" /> As the project went over schedule, their payment from Accolade came to an end.<ref name = "GDC2015"/> Fred Ford decided to financially support the team for the final months of development,<ref name="pelit"></ref> and they were ultimately able to finish the project with the help of numerous family, friends, and other collaborators.<ref name=gamespotinterview/>
The team stretched their music budget by holding a contest to create the game's soundtrack.<ref name="Barton2016"/> Reiche and Ford had previously discovered the sample-based MOD file format while porting the first Star Controls music to consoles.<ref name = "GDC2015"/> They posted the music contest to a newsgroup for Amiga users, despite the fact that the game was for PC, because Amiga hobbyists were the main community of MOD-tracker users in that time.<ref></ref> The contest attracted people from around the world, due to the popularity of the MOD format in the largely European demoscene.<ref name = "GDC2015"/> The contest also led them to discover a teenager named Dan Nicholson, who they hired to create additional music as needed.<ref name="Barton2016"/> Further music came from existing team member Erol Otus, who first composed the Ur-Quan theme on a synthesizer before it was re-sampled and exported to the MOD file format.<ref name = "GDC2015"/> The critically acclaimed soundtrack would include music from Aaron Grier, Erol Otus, Eric Berge, Riku Nuottajärvi, and Dan Nicholson.<ref name="FACTmag"></ref>
Months after its release, the team would create hours of voice dialog for the 3DO version of the game, taking advantage of space afforded by CD-ROM technology, while bucking the trend of CD-based games with full motion video.<ref name="retrogamer14"></ref> Game Developer Magazine featured the game in its list of open source space games, praising its scale and charm, as well as its new features.<ref></ref> In the end, the 3DO version would feature 11 hours of voice audio, including performances from Reiche, as well as friends Greg Johnson and Erol Otus.<ref name="GDC2015"></ref>
==Reception==
Star Control II received a positive reception around its release, as well as several awards. Soon after, Star Control II began to appear on many "all time best" lists for players and industry figures,<ref name="SC3preview2" /> a reputation that has continued ever since.<ref name="bestclassic2" />
=== Reviews and awards ===

Indeed, Star Control II is admired and influential amongst notable developers in the game industry. Tim Cain credits Star Control II with inspiring his open-ended design in both Fallout and Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura, calling it his personal favorite RPG of all time and one of the best computer games ever developed.<ref> urltoken Alt URL</ref><ref> urltoken "The CRPG Book Project - "1992 – Star Control 2" from Tim Cain</ref> Founder of BioWare Ray Muzyka also cites Star Control as an inspiration, stating that "the uncharted worlds in Mass Effect comes from imagining what a freely explorable universe would be like inside a very realistic next-gen game."<ref></ref> Indeed, journalists have noted heavy similarities in the story, characters, and overall experience of Mass Effect,<ref></ref><ref name="PCGNHD2"></ref><ref name="bestclassic4"></ref> even calling Star Control II a Spiritual successor.<ref name=":43" /> FACT notes that Star Control II<nowiki/>'s "galaxy-spanning sci-fi setting whose adventure elements foreshadowed Mass Effect by a good 15 years".<ref name="FACTmag3"/> PCGamesN explains further, that "while Star Control II is a little clunky and esoteric by modern standards, this was the Mass Effect of its era, defining many of the elements you might have taken for granted in Bioware's classic sci-fi RPG series. . Star Control’s weird and wonderful alien races are far more exciting than anything Bioware gave us."<ref></ref> Henrik Fahraeus of Paradox Interactive credits Star Control II as a major influence on strategy game Stellaris,<ref></ref> after expressing disappointment that the Mass Effect series lacked the exploration and openness of Star Control II.<ref name=":04"></ref> Game writer and narrative designer Zoë Quinn called Star Control II a childhood obsession, describing how she “filled several notebooks with notes and maps as I constantly explored Fake Space, trying to see everything and uncover all the secrets in the game."<ref name=":04" /> Vice President of Insomniac Games Brian Hastings ranked Star Control II as one of his top games, and one of "the most original and perfectly executed games ever".<ref></ref> Alexx Kay of Irrational Games hailed Star Control II as the best game "by a mile", noting that it was "one of the first story-based games where your actions had clear consequences".<ref name=":63"/> In Joshua Bycer's book "20 Essential Games to Study", his first chapter is devoted to analyzing Star Control II, as an unprecedented open world game far ahead of its contemporaries.<ref name="Bycer20183"></ref>
Star Control II is sometimes credited as a spiritual successor to Starflight, inheriting its legacy as a genre-defining space exploration game.<ref></ref>
==The Ur-Quan Masters==
The Ur-Quan Masters is a modified open-source release of Star Control 2, based on a freely available version of the original 3DO code.<ref name="HG101series2" /><ref name="Tringham2014"></ref>
== Sequel and continuity ==
In 2017, Reiche and Ford announced plans to create a direct sequel to The Ur Quan Masters,<ref name="UQMTM"></ref> which would effectively bypass the story from Star Control 3, created by the now defunct Legend Entertainment.<ref></ref><ref></ref> This announcement comes after years of fan requests for a sequel.<ref></ref> Due to disagreements between the trademark owner of "Star Control" and the ownership of the intellectual property within the games previously sold under the trademark, the game development has been halted.
