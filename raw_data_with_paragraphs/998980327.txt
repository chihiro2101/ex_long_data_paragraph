McDonnell created a monthly comic strip, Bad Baby, for Parents Magazine, which ran for ten years. (The Bad Baby strips were collected and published by Ballantine Books in 1988).<ref>Fiore, R.

Mutts became syndicated, distributed by King Features Syndicate, starting in 1994. It won the Harvey Award for Best Comic Strip in 1997, 1999, 2001, 2002, and 2003.
