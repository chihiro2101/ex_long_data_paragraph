Mahamudra

==History and semantic field==
The usage and meaning of the term mahāmudrā evolved over the course of hundreds of years of Indian and Tibetan history, and as a result, the term may refer variously to "mudra, one of a sequence of 'seals' in tantra practice, the nature of reality as Shunyata, a meditation procedure focusing on the nature of Mind, an innate blissful gnosis cognizing emptiness nondually, or the supreme attainment of buddhahood at the culmination of the Tantric path."<ref name="Jackson" />
According to Jamgon Kongtrul, the Indian theoretical sources of the mahāmudrā tradition are Yogacara Tathagatagarbha (Buddha-nature) texts such as the Samdhinirmocana sutra and the Uttaratantra.<ref>Brown, Daniel P.;Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra Tradition, 2006, p 7.</ref> The actual practice and lineage of mahāmudrā can be traced back to wandering mahasiddhas or great adepts during the Indian Pala Dynasty (760-1142), beginning with the 8th century siddha Saraha.<ref>Brown, Daniel P.;Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra Tradition, 2006, p 16.</ref> 
Saraha Dohas (songs or poems in rhyming couplets) are the earliest mahamudra literature extant, and promote some of the unique features of mahamudra such as the importance of Pointing-out instruction by a guru, the non-dual nature of mind, and the negation of conventional means of achieving enlightenment such as samatha-vipasyana meditation, monasticism, rituals, tantric practices and doctrinal study in favor of mahamudra 'non-meditation' and 'non-action'.<ref>Brown, Daniel P.;Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra Tradition, 2006, p 17.</ref> Later Indian masters such as Padmavajra, Tilopa, and Gampopa incorporated mahamudra into tantric, monastic and traditional meditative frameworks.<ref>Brown, Daniel P.;Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra Tradition, 2006, p 18-22.</ref>
===Etymology in the tantras===
It has been speculated that the first use of the term was in the c. 7th century Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa, in which it refers to a hand gesture.<ref name="Jackson" /> The term is mentioned with increasing frequency as Buddhist tantra developed further, particularly in the Yogatantras, where it appears in Tattvasaṁgraha and the Vajraśekhara-tantra. Here it also denotes a hand gesture, now linked to three other hand mudrās—the action (karma), pledge (samaya), and dharma mudrās—but also involves "mantra recitations and visualizations that symbolize and help to effect one’s complete identification with a deity’s divine form or awakening Mind (bodhicitta)."<ref name="Jackson" /> In Mahayoga tantras such as the Guhyasamāja tantra, it "has multiple meanings, including a contemplation-recitation conducive to the adamantine body, speech, and Mind of the tathāgatas; and the object-—emptiness-—through realization of which 'all is accomplished,'" and it is also used as a synonym for awakened Mind, which is said to be "primordially unborn, empty, unarisen, nonexistent, devoid of self, naturally luminous, and immaculate like the sky."<ref name="Jackson" />
In the Yoginī or Anuttarayoga Tantras, mahāmudrā "emerges as a major Buddhist concept."<ref name="Jackson" />> As scholar Roger Jackson explains,
Thubten Yeshe explains: "Mahāmudrā means absolute seal, totality, unchangeability. Sealing something implies that you cannot destroy it. Mahāmudrā was not created or invented by anybody; therefore it cannot be destroyed. It is absolute reality".<ref></ref>
Aryadeva summarises: "The discussion of how to attain mahāmudrā entails methods for meditating on Mind itself as something having voidness as its nature".<ref name="Gyatso">quoted in </ref>
== Indian sources ==
All of the various Tibetan mahāmudrā lineages originated with the Mahasiddhas of the Pala Empire of 8-12th century India. The earliest figure is the tenth century poet yogi Saraha, and his student Nagarjuna (not to be confused with the earlier philosopher).<ref>Roberts, Peter Alan, Mahamudra and Related Instructions: Core Teachings of the Kagyu Schools (Library of Tibetan Classics) 2011, p. 9-10</ref> Saraha's collections of poems and songs, mostly composed in the apabhramsa language are the earliest Indian sources for mahāmudrā teachings, aside from the Buddhist Tantras.
Other influential Indian mahasiddhas include Tilopa, his student Naropa and Naropa's consort Niguma. Tilopa's "Ganges Mahāmudrā" song is a widely taught short mahāmudrā text. Niguma is an important source for the Shangpa Kagyu lineage. 
Tilopa's pupil Maitripa became the principal master of mahāmudrā in India during his time and most lineages of mahāmudrā are traced from Maitripa.<ref name=":2">Roberts, Peter Alan, Mahamudra and Related Instructions: Core Teachings of the Kagyu Schools (Library of Tibetan Classics) 2011, p. 11.</ref> Maitripa was a very influential figure of the eleventh century, a scholar and tantrika who widely taught the Ratnagotravibhāga, a text which is widely seen as bridging the sutric Mahayana and Anuttarayogatantra views.<ref name=":4">Ulrich Timme Kragh, Tibetan yoga and mysticism : a textual study of the yogas of Nāropa and Mahāmudrā meditation in the medieval tradition of Dags po 2015, p. 71</ref> He composed commentaries on the buddhist dohas, and his works include a collection of 26 texts on "non-conceptual realization" (amanasikara), which are a key Indian source of mahāmudrā teachings that blend sutra and tantra and teach an instantaneous approach to awakening.<ref>Mathes, Klaus-Dieter, A Fine Blend of Mahamudra and Madhyamaka: Maitripa's Collection of Texts on Non-Conceptual Realization (Amanasikara), (Sitzungsberichte Der Philosophisch-Historischen Klasse), 2016, p. 1.</ref><ref>Ulrich Timme Kragh, Tibetan yoga and mysticism : a textual study of the yogas of Nāropa and Mahāmudrā meditation in the medieval tradition of Dags po 2015, p. 72-73</ref>
Maitripa described mahāmudrā as follows:<blockquote>"Mahāmudrā, that which is unified and beyond the mind, is clear yet thoughtless, pervasive, and vast like space. Its aspect of great compassion is apparent yet devoid of any nature. Manifesting clearly like the moon in water; It is beyond all terms, boundaries or center. Polluted by nothing, it is stainless and beyond hope and fear. It cannot be described, like the dream of a mute."<ref>Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang; Khenpo Konchok Tamphel (translator), Water Crystal: A commentary on the Ganges Mahamudra.</ref></blockquote>One of Maitripa's students was the Kadam scholar Atiśa, who taught mahāmudrā to his pupil Dromtön (1004-63) who decided not to make mahāmudrā a part of the Kadam tradition.<ref name=":2" /> Another pupil of Maitripa, Marpa Lotsawa, also introduced mahāmudrā to Tibet and his disciple Milarepa is also a central figure of this lineage. Another important figure in the introduction of mahāmudrā to the area is Vajrapani, yet another student of Maitripa.<ref name=":3">Roberts, Peter Alan, Mahamudra and Related Instructions: Core Teachings of the Kagyu Schools (Library of Tibetan Classics) 2011, p. 12.</ref> His student, Asu, also was a teacher of Rechungpa (1084-1161), one of Milarepa's pupils.<ref name=":3" />
Gampopa, a key figure of the Kagyu school, refers to three important cycles of Indian texts which discuss Mahāmudrā as his main sources:<ref>Ulrich Timme Kragh, Tibetan yoga and mysticism : a textual study of the yogas of Nāropa and Mahāmudrā meditation in the medieval tradition of Dags po 2015, p. 76-77.</ref><ref name=":5">Mathes, Klaus-Dieter, A Fine Blend of Mahamudra and Madhyamaka: Maitripa's Collection of Texts on Non-Conceptual Realization (Amanasikara), (Sitzungsberichte Der Philosophisch-Historischen Klasse), 2016, p. 2.</ref>
* "The Seven or eight Siddhiḥ Texts" (Saptasiddhiḥ, Tib. Grub pa sde bdun), which include Padmavajra's Guhyasiddhi and Indrabhuti's Jñanasiddhi.
* "The Cycle of Six Heart Texts" or "Six works on essential meaning" (Snying po skor drug), including Saraha's Dohakosha and Nagarjunagarbha's Caturmudraniscaya.
* Maitripa's "Cycle of Teachings on Non-Cognition" (Yid la mi byed pa 'i chos skor).
This classification existed since the time of Buton Rinchen Drub (1290-1364).<ref name=":5" />
Indian sources of mahāmudrā were later compiled by the Karmapa Chos grags rgya mtsho (1454- 1506) into a three-volume compilation entitled "The Indian Mahāmudrā Treatises" (Tib. Phyag rgya chen po 'i rgya gzhung). This compilation includes the above three collections, along with the Anavilatantra and texts that teach a non-tantric "instantaneous"approach to the practice by an Indian master named Sakyasribhadra.<ref>Ulrich Timme Kragh, Tibetan yoga and mysticism : a textual study of the yogas of Nāropa and Mahāmudrā meditation in the medieval tradition of Dags po 2015, p. 65.

==Tibetan traditions==
Mahāmudrā is most well known as a teaching within the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. However the Gelug and Sakya schools also practice mahāmudrā. The Nyingma school and Bon practise Dzogchen, a cognate but distinct method of direct introduction to the principle of śūnyatā. Nyingma students may also receive supplemental training in mahāmudrā, and the Palyul Nyingma lineage preserves a lineage of the "Union of Mahāmudrā and Ati Yoga" originated by Karma Chagme.
===Kagyu tradition===
Gampopa Sönam Rinchen (1079-1153), a Kadam monk who was a student of the lay tantric yogi Milarepa, is a key figure in the Kagyu tradition. He is responsible for much of the development of Kagyu monastic institutions and for recording the teachings of the lineage in writing.<ref name=":1">Duff, Tony, Gampopa's Mahamudra, p. v-vii.</ref> He synthesized the Mahayana Kadam teachings with the tantric teachings he received from Milarepa and developed a unique system of mahāmudrā which he often taught without tantric empowerment, relying instead on Guru Yoga.<ref>Ulrich Timme Kragh, Tibetan yoga and mysticism : a textual study of the yogas of Nāropa and Mahāmudrā meditation in the medieval tradition of Dags po 2015, p. 163-164.</ref> 
Mahamudra is defined by Gampopa as "the realization of the natural state as awareness-emptiness, absolutely clear and transparent, without root". Gampopa also states that mahamudra is "the Prajnaparamita, beyond thought and expression."<ref name=":0" /> Gampopa taught mahamudra in a five part system to his disciples, one of his most well known disciples, Phagmo Drupa (1110-1170) became a very successful teacher who continued to teach this five part system and eight "junior" kagyu lineages are traced to him.<ref name=":1" /> This “Five-Part Mahāmudrā” system became one of the main ways that Mahāmudrā was transmitted in Kagyu lineages after Gampopa.<ref name=":1" />
The tradition which follows Gampopa is called Dagpo Kagyu. A key Mahāmudrā author of this tradition is Dagpo Tashi Namgyal, well known for his Mahāmudrā: The Moonlight. Karma Kagyu Karmapa like the ninth Karmapa Wangchuk Dorje also composed important Mahāmudrā texts. A development of these later mahāmudrā writers is the integration of the common Mahayana teachings on samatha and Vipaśyanā as preliminaries to the practice of mahāmudrā.<ref>Ulrich Timme Kragh, Tibetan yoga and mysticism : a textual study of the yogas of Nāropa and Mahāmudrā meditation in the medieval tradition of Dags po 2015, p. 165.</ref>
====Three types of teaching====
The Kagyu lineage divides the mahāmudrā teachings into three types, "sutra mahāmudrā," "tantra mahāmudrā," and "essence mahāmudrā," in a formulation that appears to originate with Jamgon Kongtrul.<ref>"Blending the Sūtras with the Tantras: The Influence of Maitrīpa and his Circle on the formation of Sūtra Mahāmudrā in the Kagyu Schools" by Klaus-Dieter Mathes in Tibetan Buddhist Literature and Praxis : Studies in its Formative Period, 900-1400, PIATS 2003: Tibetan Studies: Proceedings of the Tenth seminar of the International Association for Tibetan Studies. Oxford: 2003 pg 201</ref> Sutra mahāmudrā, as the name suggests, draws its philosophical view and meditation techniques from the sutrayana tradition. Tantric mahāmudrā employs such tantric techniques as tummo, dream yoga, and ösel, three of the Six Yogas of Naropa. Essence mahāmudrā is based on the direct instruction of a qualified lama, known as pointing-out instruction.
====As a path beyond sutra and tantra====
Kagyu lineage figures such as Gampopa presented a form of mahāmudrā that was said to transcend the vehicles of sutrayana and vajrayana. According to Karl Brunnholzl, Gampopa saw mahāmudrā as a third path that was neither sutra nor tantra which he called “the path of prajna” and “the path of suchness,” and which "relies on blessing and is for those who are intelligent and of sharp faculties."<ref name=":11">Brunnholzl, Karl (2015). When the Clouds Part: The Uttaratantra and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, pp. 192-193. Shambhala Publications.</ref> Brunnholzl adds that for Gampopa, the mahāmudrā path of "taking direct perceptions as the path" relies on introduction by a genuine guru to the luminous dharmakaya and thus:<blockquote>Through having been taught an unmistaken instruction of definitive meaning like that, one then takes native mind as the path, without separating the triad of view, conduct, and meditation in terms of this connate mind about which one has gained certainty within oneself.<ref name=":11" /> </blockquote>Gampopa also stated that mahāmudrā was "the highest path that actually transcends both sutra and tantra." Brunnholzl further states that "In practice, most of Gampopa's preserved teachings consist primarily of sutra-based instructions and then conclude with Mahāmudrā, either not teaching the path of mantra at all or mentioning it only in passing."<ref name=":11" /> 
The Kagyu tradition bases their mahāmudrā teachings on the works of Indian mahasiddhas like Saraha and Maitripa. According to Klaus-Dieter Mathes,
Dr. Mathes investigated the practice described in these mahāmudrā works and found that it is not necessarily Tantric. In Saraha's dohās, it is simply the realization of Mind's co-emergent nature with the help of a genuine guru. Maitrīpa (ca. 1007– 085) uses the term mahāmudrā for precisely such an approach, thus employing an originally Tantric term for something that is not a specifically Tantric practice. It is thus legitimate for later Kagyupas to speak of Saraha's mahāmudrā tradition as being originally independent of the Sūtras and the Tantras. For Maitrīpa, the direct realization of emptiness (or the co-emergent) is the bridging link between the Sūtras and the Tantras, and it is thanks to this bridge that mahāmudrā can be linked to the Sūtras and the Tantras. In the Sūtras it takes the form of the practice of non-abiding and becoming mentally disengaged, while in the Tantras it occupies a special position among the four mudrās.<ref name="Mathes">"Indian Mahāmudrā-Works” in the Early Bka’ brgyud pa." Centre for Tantric Studies website. </ref> 
The Kagyu teachings of mahāmudrā became a point of controversy. The possibility of sudden liberating realization and the practice of mahāmudrā without the need for tantric initiation was seen as contrary to the teachings of the Buddhist tantras and as being just a form of Chinese Zen by certain critics.<ref>Dakpo Tashi Namgyal, Bkra-śis-rnam-rgyal (Dwags-po Paṇ-chen) (2006), Mahamudra: The Moonlight - Quintessence of Mind and Meditation, Wisdom Publications, p.104</ref> 
==== Kagyu mahāmudrā lineages ====
Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama identified a number of mahāmudrā lineages, according to their main practices for achieving mahāmudrā. In his teachings on the First Panchen Lama's root text and auto-commentary the 14th Dalai Lama delineated the Kagyu practice lineages as follows:<ref></ref>
* The Karma Kagyu "Simultaneously Arising as Merged" tradition - This is the tradition introduced by Gampopa with a main practice of the Six Yogas of Naropa.
* The Shangpa Kagyu "Amulet Box" tradition - This tradition came from Khyungpo Naljor and its main practice is the Six yogas of Niguma.
* The Drikung Kagyu "Possessing Five" tradition - Jigten Gonpo founded the school and mahāmudrā lineage whose main practice is known as the "fivefold mahāmudrā" consisting of bodhicitta, yidam practice, Guru Yoga, mahamudra and dedication.
* The Drukpa Lineage "Six Spheres of Equal Taste" tradition - Tsangpa Gyare founded this tradition which encompasses a range of practices, including the Six Yogas of Naropa.
* The Dagpo Kagyu "Four Syllables" tradition - This is the tradition that derives from Maitripa. The four syllables are a-ma-na-si which make up the Sanskrit word meaning 'not to take to mind' and passed through the Dagpo Kagyu branches, i.e. any that descend from the teachings of Tilopa rather than those of Niguma, which in practice means all but the Shangpa Kagyu.
===Gelug tradition===
The Gelug school's mahamudra tradition is traditionally traced back to the school's founder Tsongkhapa (1357- 1419), who was said to have received oral transmission from Manjushri, and it is also traced to the Indian masters like Saraha through the Drikung Kagyu master Chennga Chokyi Gyalpo who transmitted Kagyu Mahamudra teachings (probably the five fold Mahamudra) to Tsongkhapa.<ref>Jackson, Roger, "The dGe ldan-bKa’ brgyud Tradition of Mahamudra How Much dGe ldan? How Much bKa’ brgyud?" in Newland, Guy, Changing Minds: Contributions to the Study of Buddhism and Tibet in Honor of Jeffrey Hopkins 2001 p. 155.</ref> Jagchen Jampa Pal (1310-1391), a prominent holder of the 'jag pa tradition of the Shangpa teachings, was also one of the teachers of rje Tsongkhapa.
However, a specifically "Gelug" Mahamudra system was only recorded at the time of Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, 4th Panchen Lama (sometimes named the "1st Panchen Lama", 1570-1662), who wrote a root Mahamudra text on the "Highway of the Conquerors: Root Verses for the Precious Geden Gelug Kagyu Oral Transmission of Mahāmudrā" (dGe-ldan bka'-brgyud rin-po-che'i phyag-chen rtsa-ba rgyal-ba'i gzhung-lam) and its auto commentary (the Yang gsal sgron me, "Lamp re-illuminating Mahamudra"), which is still widely taught and commented upon.<ref name=":10">Jackson, Roger, "The dGe ldan-bKa’ brgyud Tradition of Mahamudra How Much dGe ldan? How Much bKa’ brgyud?" in Newland, Guy, Changing Minds: Contributions to the Study of Buddhism and Tibet in Honor of Jeffrey Hopkins 2001 p. 155.</ref><ref> urltoken Berzin, A root text for Mahamudra</ref><ref>Thuken Losang Chokyi Nyima, The Crystal Mirror of Philosophical Systems, p 620.
</ref> Before this work, Gelug writings on Mahamudra tended to follow orthodox Kagyu teachings.<ref>Jackson, Roger, "The dGe ldan-bKa’ brgyud Tradition of Mahamudra How Much dGe ldan? How Much bKa’ brgyud?" in Newland, Guy, Changing Minds: Contributions to the Study of Buddhism and Tibet in Honor of Jeffrey Hopkins 2001 p. 155.</ref> This text and its auto commentary have become a central work on Mahamudra in the Gelug school. The current 14th Dalai Lama and Lama Yeshe are some of the modern Gelug figures which have written commentaries on this key Gelug Mahamudra text.<ref>Lama Yeshe, Mahamudra: How to Discover Our True Nature</ref><ref>Dalai Lama &nbsp;(Author), Alexander Berzin (Author), The Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra.</ref>
The Panchen Lama Chökyi Gyaltsen, himself was influenced by Kagyu teachings, and wished to imitate great siddhas like Milarepa and Sabaripa.<ref name=":10" /><ref>Willis, Jan, Enlightened Beings: Life Stories from the Ganden Oral Tradition, p 20.</ref> He names various Mahamudra and Dzogchen lineages in his text, and comes to the conclusion that "their definitive meanings are all seen to come to the same intended point."<ref>Gyumed Khensur Lobsang Jampa; The Easy Path: Illuminating the First Panchen Lama's Secret Instructions, Calm abiding.</ref> Chökyi Gyaltsen also sides with the Kagyu school against Sakya, arguing that there is a sutra level of Mahamudra.<ref name=":10" /> However, in his account, sutra Mahamudra is particularly associated with a gradual path and his presentation of insight practice (vipasyana) is uniquely Gelug.<ref name=":10" />
Yongdzin Yeshe Gyaltsen (also known as Khachen Yeshe Gyaltsen, tutor of the 8th Dalai Lama, 1713–93) composed a commentary on Chökyi Gyaltsen's Mahamudra text, entitled "The Lamp of the Clear and Excellent Path of the Oral Tradition Lineage" (Yongs-'dzin ye shes rgyal mtshan).<ref>Wallace, B. Alan, Balancing the Mind: A Tibetan Buddhist Approach To Refining Attention, 2005, p. 239.</ref> He also comments on Mahamudra in the context of Lama Chopa Guru Yoga.<ref>Kachen Yeshe Gyaltsen, David Gonzales (translator), Manjushri's Innermost Secret: A Profound Commentary of Oral Instructions on the Practice of Lama Chopa</ref>
===Sakya mahāmudrā===
Following the great Sakya exegete and philosopher Sakya Pandita (1182-1251), mahāmudrā in the Sakya school is seen as the highest Tantra realization, which means that mahāmudrā practice is only taken on after having been Empowerment (Vajrayana) and practicing the creation and completion stages of deity yoga. <ref></ref><ref name=":0">Stenzel, Julia, The Mahåmudrå of Sakya Pandita, Indian International Journal of Buddhist Studies Volume 15 (2014)</ref> In his "A Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes" (Sdom gsum rab dbye), Sakya Pandita criticized the non-tantric "sutra" mahamudra approaches of the Kagyu teachers such as Gampopa who taught mahāmudrā to those who had not received tantric initiations and based themselves on the Ratnagotravibhāga.<ref name=":0" /> He argued that the term mahāmudrā does not occur in the sutras, only in the highest class of tantras and that only through tantric initiation does mahāmudrā arise: "Our own Great Seal consists of Gnosis risen from initiation."<ref name=":0" /> According to Sakya Pandita, through the four empowerments or initiations given by a qualified guru, most practitioners will experience a likeness of true mahāmudrā, though a few rare individuals experience true mahāmudrā.<ref name=":0" /> Through the practice of the creation and completion stages of tantra, the tantrika develops this partial understanding of bliss and emptiness into a completely non-dual gnosis, the real Mahamudra, which corresponds to the attainment of the Path of Seeing, the first Bodhisattva bhumi.<ref name=":0" />
In Sakya, this insight known as mahāmudrā is described variously as "the unity of lucidity and emptiness, the unity of awareness and emptiness, the unity of bliss and emptiness" and also "the natural reality (chos nyid gnyug ma) which is emptiness possessing the excellence of all aspects."<ref name=":0" />
== Practices and methods ==
A common schema used in the Kagyu school is that of Ground (buddha-nature, Śūnyatā), Path (practice) and Fruition mahāmudrā (Buddhahood).<ref>Reginald Ray, Secret of the Vajra World. Shambhala 2001, page 266.</ref> The advice and guidance of a qualified guru is considered to be very important in developing faith and interest in the dharma as well as in learning and practicing mahāmudrā meditation. Most often mahāmudrā (particularly essence mahāmudrā) is preceded by meeting with a lama and receiving pointing-out instruction. Some parts of the transmission are done verbally and through empowerments and "reading transmissions." A student typically goes through various tantric practices before undertaking the "formless" practices described below; the latter are classified as part of "essence mahāmudrā."<ref>Reginald Ray, Secret of the Vajra World. Shambhala 2001, pages 273-274.</ref> Ngondro are the preliminary practices common to both mahāmudrā and dzogchen traditions and include practices such as contemplating the "four thoughts that turn the mind", prostrations, and Guru Yoga. According to one scholar, most people have difficulty beginning directly with formless practices and lose enthusiasm doing so, so the tantric practices work as a complement to the formless ones.<ref>Reginald Ray, Secret of the Vajra World. Shambhala 2001, pages 272-274.</ref>
Another way to divide the practice of mahāmudrā is between the tantric mahāmudrā practices and the sutra practices. Tantric mahāmudrā practices involves practicing deity yoga with a yidam as well as subtle body practices like the Six Yogas of Naropa and can only be done after empowerment.<ref>Reginald Ray, Secret of the Vajra World. Shambhala 2001, pages 271-272.</ref> After the preliminary practices, the Kagyu school's sutra mahāmudrā practice is often divided into the ordinary or essential meditation practices and the extraordinary meditation practices. The ordinary practices are samatha (calming) and vipassana (special insight). The extraordinary practices include "formless" practices like 'one taste yoga' and 'non-meditation'. The tradition also culminates with certain special enlightenment and post-enlightenment practices.<ref>Brown, Daniel P.;Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra Tradition, 2006, p 28-29.</ref> According to Reginald Ray, the "formless" practices, also called "Essence mahamudra," is when "one engages directly in practices of abandoning discursive thinking and resting the mind in the clear, luminous awareness that is mahamudra."<ref name=":6">Reginald Ray, Secret of the Vajra World. Shambhala 2001, pages 272.</ref> The reason that preparatory practices and "form" practices like deity yoga and Vipassanā are needed is because formless practices are quite difficult and subtle, and most practitioners are not able to enter into the simple essence of mind successfully without considerable mental preparation.<ref name=":6" />
===Four yogas and five paths===
In the Dagpo Kagyu tradition as presented by Dagpo Tashi Namgyal, Mahāmudrā is divided into four distinct phases known as the four yogas of mahāmudrā (S. catvāri mahāmudrā yoga, . They are as follows:<ref>Mahamudra: The Moonlight: Quintessence of Mind and Meditation by Dakpo Tashi Namgyal Wisdom Publications; 2nd ed: 2006 pg 463</ref>
# one-pointedness (S. ekāgra, T. རྩེ་གཅིག་ rtse gcig)
# simplicity (S. niṣprapānca, T. སྤྲོས་བྲལ་ spros bral) "free from complexity" or "not elaborate."
# one taste (S. samarasa, T. རོ་གཅིག་ ro gcig)
# non-meditation (S. abhāvanā, T. སྒོམ་མེད་ sgom med) The state of not holding to either an object of meditation nor to a meditator. Nothing further needs to be 'meditated upon' or 'cultivated' at this stage.
These stages parallel the Semde#Four Yogas of Semde. The four yogas of mahāmudrā have been correlated with the Mahāyāna five paths (S. pañcamārga), according to Tsele Natsok Rangdröl (Lamp of Mahāmudrā):
*Ngöndro: path of accumulation
*One-pointedness: path of application
*Simplicity: paths of seeing and most of the path of meditation (bhūmis one through six)
*One taste: last part of the path of meditation, most of the path of no-more-learning (bhūmis seven through nine)
*Nonmeditation: last part of the path of no-more learning (tenth bhūmi) and buddhahood (bhūmis eleven through thirteen)
Dagpo Tashi Namgyal meanwhile in his Moonlight of Mahāmudrā correlates them as follows:
*Outer and inner preliminary practices and one-pointedness: path of accumulation
*Simplicity: path of application
*One taste: paths of meditation & no-more-learning
*Nonmeditation: path of no more learning & buddhahood
According to Je Gyare as reported by Dakpo Tashi Namgyal (Moonlight of Mahāmudrā):
*One-pointedness: paths of accumulation and application
*Simplicity: path of seeing (first bhūmi)
*One taste: paths of meditation and part of the path no-more-learning (bhūmis two through eight)
*Nonmeditation: rest of path of no-more-learning, buddhahood (bhūmis nine through thirteen)
According to Drelpa Dönsal as reported by Dakpo Tashi Namgyal (Moonlight of Mahāmudrā):
*One-pointedness: paths of accumulation and application
*Simplicity: path of seeing (first bhūmi)
*One taste: paths of meditation and no-more-learning (bhūmis two through ten)
*Nonmeditation: buddhahood (bhūmis eleven through thirteen)
===Ordinary meditation practices===
As in most Buddhist schools of meditation, the basic meditative practice of mahāmudrā is divided into two approaches: samatha ("tranquility","calm abiding") and vipassana ("special insight"). This division is contained in the instructions given by Wangchuk Dorje, the ninth Karmapa, in a series of texts he composed; these epitomize teachings given on mahāmudrā practice.<ref name=":7">Reginald Ray, Secret of the Vajra World. Shambhala 2001, page 274.</ref>
====Śamatha====
Often associated with the yoga of one-pointedness, mahāmudrā śamatha contains instructions on ways to sit with proper posture, called the seven point posture of Vairocana.<ref name=":7" /> The mahāmudrā shamatha teachings also include instructions on how to work with a mind that is beset with various impediments to focusing,<ref name=":8">Reginald Ray, Secret of the Vajra World. Shambhala 2001, pages 274-275.</ref> such as raising the gaze when one feels dull or sleepy, and lowering it again when one feels overly excited. Two types of mahāmudrā śamatha are generally taught: śamatha with support and śamatha without support.
Mahāmudrā śamatha with support involves the use of an object of attention to which the meditator continually returns his or her attention. Wangchuk Dorje mentions that one can use a wide variety of supports, visual objects like a candle flame, but also sounds, a smell, etc.<ref name=":8" />
One of the main techniques involved in Mahāmudrā śamatha with support is Anapanasati (S. ānāpānasmṛti). Mindfulness of breathing practice is considered to be a profound means of calming the mind to prepare it for the stages that follow. For the Kagyupa, in the context of mahāmudrā, mindfulness of breathing is thought to be the ideal way for the meditator to transition into taking the mind itself as the object of meditation and generating vipaśyanā on that basis.<ref>Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra tradition by Dan Brown. Wisdom Publications: 2006 pg 221-34</ref> The prominent contemporary Kagyu/Nyingma master Chogyam Trungpa, expressing the Kagyu Mahāmudrā view, wrote, "your breathing is the closest you can come to a picture of your mind. It is the portrait of your mind in some sense. The traditional recommendation in the lineage of meditators that developed in the Kagyu-Nyingma tradition is based on the idea of mixing mind and breath."<ref>The Path is the Goal, in The Collected Works of Chogyam Trungpa, Vol Two. Shambhala Publications. pgs 49, 51</ref> 
Śamatha without support or objectless meditation refers to resting the mind without the use of a specific focal point or object of concentration. According to Reginald Ray, in this practice "the eyes are open and one gazes straight ahead into space, directing one's mind to nothing at all."<ref name=":8" /> 
In Gelug sutra mahāmudrā, the śamatha techniques are similar to the Kagyu presentation.<ref name=":10" />
====Vipaśyanā====
The detailed instructions for the insight practices are what make mahāmudrā (and Dzogchen) unique in Tibetan Buddhism. In Mahāmudrā vipaśyanā, Wangchuck Dorje gives ten separate contemplations that are used to disclose the essential mind within; five practices of "looking at" and five of "pointing out" the nature of mind. They all presume some level of stillness cultivated by mahāmudrā shamatha. In retreat, each contemplation would typically be assigned specific time periods.<ref>Reginald Ray, Secret of the Vajra World. Shambhala 2001, page 276.</ref>
The five practices for "looking at" the nature of the mind are as follows:<ref>Reginald Ray, Secret of the Vajra World. Shambhala 2001, pages 276-277.</ref>
* Looking at the settled mind. One repeatedly looks at the mind's still state, possibly posing questions to arouse awareness, such as "what is its nature? It is perfectly still?"
* Looking at the moving or thinking mind. One tries to closely examine the arising, existence, and ceasing of thoughts, possibly posing oneself questions so as to better understand this process, such as "how does it arise? What is its nature?"
* Looking at the mind reflecting appearances. One looks at the way in which phenomena of the external senses occur in experience. Usually, a visual object is taken as the subject. One repeatedly looks at the object, trying to see just how that appearance arises in the mind, and understand the nature of this process. One possibly asks questions such as "what is their nature? How do they arise, dwell, and disappear? Is their initial appearance different from how they eventually understood?"
* Looking at the mind in relation to the body. One investigates questions such as "what is the mind? What is the body? Is the body our sensations? What is the relation of our sensations to our mental image of our body?"
* Looking at the settled and moving minds together. When the mind is still, one looks at that, and when the mind is in motion, one looks at that. One investigates whether these two stages are the same or different, asking questions such as "if they are the same, what is the commonality? If different, what is the difference?"
The practices for "pointing out the nature of mind" build on these. One now looks again at each of the five, but this time repeatedly asks oneself "What is it?" In these practices, one attempts to recognize and realize the exact nature of, respectively:
* The settled mind,
* The moving or thinking mind,
* The mind reflecting appearances,
* The relation of mind and body,
* The settled and thinking mind together.
The above practices do not have specific "answers"; they serve to provoke one to scrutinize experience more and more closely over time, seeking to understand what is really there.<ref>Reginald Ray, Secret of the Vajra World. Shambhala 2001, page 277.</ref>
Gelug sutra Mahāmudrā, as presented by Chökyi Gyaltsen, practices a unique Gelug style of doing vipaśyanā, based primarily on Gelug Madhyamaka. According to Roger Jackson:
<blockquote>In an actual meditation session, this involves, first of all, analyzing whether the meditator who has achieved tranquil equipoise actually can be found in an ultimate sense. Seeking the meditator both within and apart from the various elements, one encounters the meditator nowhere; seeking ultimacy in phenomena (dharmas), one encounters it nowhere. Thus, one comes to abide in a space-like awareness of the void nature of both the person and dharmas. Next (or, alternatively) one examines more carefully whether the mind itself can be found in an ultimate sense: it is discovered to have the conventional nature of a flow of awareness and clarity, but no ultimacy, no true existence. In short, one should recognize that any existent that arises, whether an object of the mind or the mind itself, is merely conceptual, is void and—as Chos rgyan quotes his guru, Sangs rgyas ye shes, as saying—”When . . . you are equipoised one-pointedly on that, marvelous!” (GBZL: 4a; trans. Dalai Lama and Berzin: 100; YSGM: 30b). In the period between meditation sessions (rjes thob), one should see all appearances as deceptive (sgyu ma), as existing differently than they appear, but one must at the same time recognize that their ultimate voidness does not preclude their conventional functioning, any more than conventional functioning gives them true existence.<ref>Jackson, Roger, "The dGe ldan-bKa’ brgyud Tradition of Mahamudra How Much dGe ldan? How Much bKa’ brgyud?" in Newland, Guy, Changing Minds: Contributions to the Study of Buddhism and Tibet in Honor of Jeffrey Hopkins 2001 p. 178.</ref></blockquote>
===Extraordinary meditation practices===
The practice of ordinary meditation eventually leads one to the yoga of simplicity, which according to Gampopa, is "understanding the essential state of that awareness of one-pointedness as nonarising emptiness, which transcends conceptual modes of reality and unreality."<ref name=":9" /> One sees all phenomena just as they are, non-conceptually, beyond extremes of existence and non-existence.<ref name=":9" />
====One taste====
According to Gampopa the yoga of one taste is "understanding diverse appearances as being one, from the standpoint of their intrinsic nature."<ref name=":9">Reginald Ray, Secret of the Vajra World. Shambhala 2001, p 280.</ref> 
Phagmo Drupa says: <blockquote>By meditating on the one taste of all things, the meditator will cognize the one taste of all these things. The diversity of appearances and nonappearances, mind and emptiness, emptiness and non-emptiness, Are all of one taste, undifferentiable in their intrinsic emptiness. Understanding and lack of understanding are of one taste; Meditation and nonmeditation are nondifferentiable; Meditation and absence of meditation are unified into one taste; Discrimination and lack of discrimination are one taste In the expanse of reality.<ref>Reginald Ray, Secret of the Vajra World. Shambhala 2001, pages 280-281</ref></blockquote>
====Non-meditation====
Gampopa states that non-meditation is "an unceasing realization of the union of appearance and its intrinsic emptiness."<ref>Reginald Ray, Secret of the Vajra World. Shambhala 2001, p 282</ref> 
Phagmo Drupa says: <blockquote>By perfecting this nonmeditation stage the meditator attains naked, unsupported awareness. This nondiscriminatory awareness is the meditation! By transcending the duality of meditation and meditator, external and internal realities, the meditating awareness dissolves itself into its luminous clarity. Transcending the intellect, it is without the duality of meditation and post-meditation. Such is the quintessence of mind. <ref>Reginald Ray, Secret of the Vajra World. Shambhala 2001, pp 282-283</ref></blockquote>

===Six Words of Advice===
Tilopa was a Bengali mahasiddha who developed the mahāmudrā method around 1,000 C.E. Tilopa gave Naropa, his successor, a teaching on mahāmudrā meditation called the Six Words of Advice.
In the following chart a translation is given of the Tilopa's Six Words of Advice.<ref>According to Ken McLeod, the text contains exactly six words; the two English translations given in the following table are both attributed to him.</ref>

Mahāmudrā (Sanskrit; , contraction of literally means "great seal" or "great imprint" and refers to the fact that "all phenomena inevitably are stamped by the fact of wisdom and emptiness inseparable".<ref>Duff, Tony, Gampopa's Mahamudra, p. vii, ix</ref> 
Mahāmudrā is a multivalent term of great importance in later Indian Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism which "also occurs occasionally in Hindu and Tangmi."<ref name="Jackson"></ref>
The name also refers to a body of teachings representing the culmination of all the practices of the Sarma schools of Tibetan Buddhism, who believe it to be the quintessential message of all of their sacred texts. The mudra portion denotes that in an adept's experience of reality, each phenomenon appears vividly, and the maha portion refers to the fact that it is beyond concept, imagination, and projection.<ref name="Ray">Reginald Ray, Secret of the Vajra World. Shambhala 2001, page 261.</ref> The practice of Mahāmudrā is also known as the teaching called "Sahaja" or "Co-emergence Yoga".<ref>Duff, Tony, Gampopa's Mahamudra, p. x</ref> In Tibetan Buddhism, particularly the Kagyu school, this is sometimes seen as a different Buddhist vehicle (yana), the "Sahajayana" (Tibetan: lhen chig kye pa), also known as the vehicle of self-liberation.<ref>Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche, Mind at Ease: Self-liberation Through Mahamudra Meditation, pp 7-11.</ref>
