Bladder cancer

==Signs and symptoms==
Bladder cancer characteristically causes blood in the urine, which may be visible or detectable only by microscope. Blood in the urine is the most common symptom in bladder cancer, and is painless. Visible blood in the urine may be of only short duration, and a urine test may be required to confirm non-visible blood. Between 80 and 90% of people with bladder cancer initially presented with visible blood.<ref name=":4"></ref> Blood in the urine may also be caused by other conditions, such as bladder or ureteric stones, infection, kidney disease, kidney cancers or vascular malformations, though these conditions (except kidney cancers) would typically be painful.
Other possible symptoms include Dysuria, frequent urination, or feeling the need to urinate without being able to do so. These signs and symptoms are not specific to bladder cancer, and may also be caused by non-cancerous conditions, including prostate infections, overactive bladder or cystitis. Some rare forms of bladder cancer like Urachal cancer produce mucin, which is then excreted in the urine causing it to be thick.<ref name="Klaile 2016 692–701"></ref>
People with advanced disease may have pelvic or bony pain, lower-extremity edema, or flank pain.<ref></ref> Rarely, a palpable mass can be detected on physical examination.<ref></ref>
==Causes==
Tobacco smoking is the main known contributor to urinary bladder cancer; in most populations, smoking is associated with over half of bladder cancer cases in men and one-third of cases among women,<ref></ref> however these proportions have reduced over recent years since there are fewer smokers in Europe and North America.<ref name=":0"></ref> There is an almost linear relationship between smoking duration (in years), Pack-year and bladder cancer risk. A risk plateau at smoking about 15 cigarettes a day can be observed (meaning that those who smoke 15 cigarettes a day are approximately at the same risk as those smoking 30 cigarettes a day). Smoking (cigar, pipe, Egyptian waterpipe and smokeless tobacco) in any form increases the risk for bladder cancer.<ref></ref> Quitting smoking reduces the risk. Risk of bladder cancer decreases by 30% within 1–4 years and continues to decrease by 60% at 25 years after smoking cessation.<ref></ref> However, former smokers will most likely always be at a higher risk of bladder cancer compared to people who have never smoked.<ref name=":0" /> Passive smoking also appear to be a risk.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
Opium consumption increases the risk of bladder cancer by 3-fold and concurrent use of opium and smoking increases the risk of bladder cancer by 5 times compared to the general population.<ref></ref>
Thirty percent of bladder tumors probably result from occupational exposure in the workplace to carcinogens. Occupational or circumstantial exposure to the following substances has been implicated as a cause of bladder cancer; benzidine (dyes manufacturing), 4-Aminobiphenyl (rubber industry), 2-naphtylamine (azo dyes manufacturing, foundry fumes, rubber industry, cigarette smoke and cancer research), phenacetin (analgesic), arsenic and chlorinated Aliphatic compound in drinking water, auramine (dye manufacturing), magenta (dye manufacturing), ortho-toluidine (dye manufacturing), epoxy and polyurethane resin hardening agents (plastics industry), chlornaphazine, Coal tar.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> Occupations at risk are bus drivers, rubber workers, painters, motor mechanics, leather (including shoe) workers, blacksmiths, machine setters, and mechanics.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Hairdressers are thought to be at risk as well because of their frequent exposure to permanent hair dyes.<ref></ref>
Infection with Schistosoma haematobium (bilharzia or schistosomiasis) may cause bladder cancer, specially of the squamous cell type.<ref></ref> Schistosoma eggs induces a chronic inflammatory state in the bladder wall resulting in tissue fibrosis.<ref></ref> Higher levels of N-nitroso compounds has been detected in urine samples of people with schistosomiasis.<ref></ref> N-Nitroso compounds have been implicated in the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis related bladder cancer. They cause alkylation DNA damage, specially Guanine to Adenine transition mutations in the HRAS and p53 Tumor-suppressor gene.<ref></ref> Mutations of p53 are detected in 73% of the tumors, BCL-2 mutations accounting for 32% and the combination of the two accounting for 13%.<ref></ref> Other causes of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder include chronic catheterizations in people with a spinal cord injury and history of treatment with cyclophosphamide.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
Ingestion of aristolochic acid present in many Chinese Herbal medicine has been shown to cause urothelial carcinoma and kidney failure.<ref></ref> Aristolochic acid activates peroxidase in the urothelium and causes transversion mutation in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene.
People who undergo external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for prostate cancer have a higher risk of developing invasive bladder cancer.<ref></ref>
In addition to these major risk factors there are also numerous other modifiable factors that are less strongly (i.e. 10–20% risk increase) associated with bladder cancer, for example, obesity.<ref></ref> Although these could be considered as minor effects, risk reduction in the general population could still be achieved by reducing the prevalence of a number of smaller risk factor together.<ref></ref>
==Genetics==
Mutations in FGFR3, TP53, PIK3CA, KDM6A, ARID1A, KMT2D, HRAS, TERT, KRAS, CREBBP, RB1 and TSC1 genes may be associated with some cases of bladder cancer.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> Deletions of parts or whole of chromosome 9 is common in bladder cancer.<ref></ref> Low grade cancer are known to harbor mutations in Ras GTPase and the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, both of which play a role in the MAPK/ERK pathway. p53 and RB gene mutations are implicated in high-grade muscle invasive tumors.<ref></ref> Eighty nine percent of muscle invasive cancers have mutations in chromatin remodeling and histone modifying genes.<ref></ref>
Deletion of both copies of the GSTM1 gene has a modest increase in risk of bladder cancer. GSTM1 gene product glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) participates in the detoxification process of carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in cigarette smoke.<ref></ref> Similarly, mutations in NAT2 (N-acetyltransferase) is associated with increased risk for bladder cancer. N-acetyltransferase helps in detoxification of carcinogens like aromatic amines (also present in cigarette smoke).<ref name = bcr2015></ref> Various single-nucleotide polymorphisms in PSCA gene present on chromosome 8 have shown to increase the risk for bladder cancer. PSCA gene promoter region has an androgen response region. Loss of reactivity of this region to androgens is hypothesized as a cause of more number of aggressive tumors in women (unlike in men who have higher amount of androgen).<ref name=":7" />
Muscle invasive bladder cancer are heterogeneous in nature. In general, they can be genetically classified into basal and luminal subtypes. Basal subtype show alterations involving RB and NFE2L2 and luminal type show changes in FGFR3 and KDM6A genes.<ref></ref> Basal subtype are subdivided into basal and claudin low-type group and are aggressive and show metastasis at presentation, however they respond to platinum based chemotherapy. Luminal subtype can be subdivided into p53-like and luminal. p53-like tumors of luminal subtype although not as aggressive as basal type, show resistance to chemotherapy<ref></ref>
==Diagnosis==
Currently, the best diagnosis of the state of the bladder is by way of cystoscopy, which is a procedure in which a flexible or rigid tube (called a cystoscope) bearing a camera and various instruments is introduced into the bladder through the urethra. The flexible procedure allows for a visual inspection of the bladder, for minor remedial work to be undertaken and for samples of suspicious lesions to be taken for a biopsy. A rigid Cystoscopy is used under general anesthesia in the operating room and can support remedial work and biopsies as well as more extensive tumor removal. Unlike papillary lesion, which grow into the bladder cavity and are readily visible, carcinoma in situ lesion are flat and obscure. Detection of carcinoma in situ lesions requires multiple biopsies from different areas of interior bladder wall.<ref name= eau_nmibc></ref> Photodynamic detection (blue light cystoscopy) can aid in the detection of carcinoma in situ. In photodynamic detection, a dye is instilled into the bladder with the help of a catheter. Cancer cells take up this dye and are visible under blue light, providing visual clues on areas to biopsied or resected.<ref name = eau_mibc></ref>
However, visual detection in any form listed above, is not sufficient for establishing pathological classification, cell type or the stage of the present tumor. A so-called cold cup biopsy during an ordinary cystoscopy (rigid or flexible) will not be sufficient for pathological staging either. Hence, a visual detection needs to be followed by transurethral surgery. The procedure is called transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). Further, a rectal and vaginal bimanual examination should be carried out before and after the TURBT to assess whether there is a palpable mass or if the tumour is fixed ("tethered") to the pelvic wall. The pathological classification and staging information obtained by the TURBT-procedure, is of fundamental importance for making the appropriate choice of ensuing treatment and/or follow-up routines.<ref name="uroweb.org"></ref>
If invasive or high grade (includes carcinoma in situ) cancer is detected on TURBT, an MRI and/or CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis or urogram and CT scan or x-ray chest should be conducted for disease staging and to look for cancer spread (metastasis). Increase in alkaline phosphatase levels without evidence of liver disease should be evaluated for bone metastasis by a bone scan.<ref name="NCI2017Pt"></ref> Although <sup>18</sup>Positron emission tomography/CT has been explored as a viable method for staging, there is no consensus to support its role in routine clinical evaluations.<ref name="eau_mibc" />
Urine cytology can be obtained in voided urine or at the time of the cystoscopy ("bladder washing"). Cytology is not very sensitive for low-grade or grade 1 tumors (a negative result cannot reliably exclude bladder cancer) but has a high specificity (a positive result reliably detects bladder cancer).<ref></ref> There are newer non-invasive urine bound markers available as aids in the diagnosis of bladder cancer, including human complement factor H-related protein, high-molecular-weight carcinoembryonic antigen, and nuclear matrix protein 22 (NMP22).<ref></ref> In United States the FDA has approved NMP22, NMP22 BladderChek, and UroVysion tests for detection and surveillance of bladder cancer and ImmunoCyt, BTA-TRAK, and BTA-STAT tests have been approved for surveillance only. BTA-STAT and BladderChek can be performed in the clinic and others are done in the laboratory.<ref name=":5"></ref><ref></ref> Other non-invasive urine based tests include the CertNDx Bladder Cancer Assay, which detects FGFR3 mutation and Urine Bladder Cancer test (UBC), which is a sandwich ELISA for Cytokeratin 8/18 fragment. Likewise, NMP22 is a sandwich ELISA and NMP22 BladderChek is a dipstick immunoassay, both of them detect nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA) tumor marker (a type of nuclear matrix protein).<ref name=":2"></ref> UroVysion is a fluorescence in situ hybridization which detects aneuploidy in chromosomes 3, 7, 17 and loss of the 9p21 locus.<ref name=":3"></ref><ref></ref> ImmunoCyt is an Immunofluorescence test which detects glycosylated CEA and Mucin-like antigens (M344, LDQ10, 19A11).<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> BTA-STAT is a dipstick immunoassay for detection of human Factor H-related protein. BTA-TRAK is a sandwich ELISA which also detects human complement factor H-related protein.<ref name=":2" /> Sensitivities across biomarkers ranged from 0.57 to 0.82 and specificities from 0.74 to 0.88. Biomarkers fared better when used in combination with urine cytology than when used alone. However, detection accuracy is poor for low grade cancers and 10% cancers are still missed.<ref name=":5" /> Current guidelines do not recommended using urinary biomarkers for detection and surveillance.<ref></ref>
===Classification===
 death from bladder cancer per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants in 2004.<ref></ref>
Globally, in 2017, bladder cancer resulted in 196,000 deaths, a 5.4% (age adjusted) decrease from 2007.<ref></ref> In 2018, the age adjusted rates of new cases of bladder cancer was 6 cases per 100,000 people and age adjusted death rate was 2 deaths per 100,000 people. Lebanon and Greece have the highest rate of new cases. In Lebanon, this high risk is attributed to high number of smokers and petrochemical air pollution.<ref></ref>
The risk of bladder cancer occurrence is four times higher in men than in women.<ref name="Global2018" /> Smoking can only partially explain this higher rates in men in western hemisphere.<ref name="pmid18792102"></ref> One other reason is that the androgen receptor, which is much more active in men than in women, may play a part in the development of the cancer.<ref></ref> This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that men undergoing androgen suppression therapy for unrelated reason seem to have a lower risk of developing bladder cancer.<ref></ref> In Africa, men are more prone to do field work and are exposed to infection with Schistosoma, this may explain to a certain extent the gap in incidence of squamous cell cancers in areas where bladder cancer is endemic.<ref name="pmid18792102" /> However, women present with more aggressive disease and have worse outcomes than men. This difference in outcomes is attributed to numerous factors such as, difference in carcinogen exposure, genetics, social and quality of care.<ref name=":7"></ref> One of the common signs of bladder cancer is hematuria and is quite often misdiagnosed as urinary tract infection in women, leading to a delay in diagnosis.<ref name=":7" /> Moreover, as mentioned earlier PSCA gene may play a role in aggressive tumors in women.
===Canada===
Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer accounting for 3.7% of the new cancer cases. in 2018, 30,700 Canadians were living with bladder cancer, 9160 new cases were diagnosed and 2467 died from it.<ref></ref> In 2019, it is estimated that 11,800 new cases will be diagnosed and 2500 will die from it.<ref name=":8"></ref> Among the 11,800 new cases, 9100 will be in men and 2700 in women. Of the 2500 who would die from it, 1800 will men and 700 will be women.<ref name=":8" />
===China===
Bladder cancer is the 14th most common cancer and 16th most common cause of cancer death. In, 2018 it accounted for 82,300 new cases and 38,200 deaths.<ref></ref> The number of new cases is comparatively lower compared to its western counterparts. Majority of the people are diagnosed with non-muscle invasive disease (75%) and the rest have muscle invasive disease (25%). Carcinoma in situ was present in only 2.4% of the cases.<ref></ref>
=== Europe ===
In 2015, 131,000 news cases were diagnosed in the European Union with 40,000 deaths. It is the 5th most common cancer and 9th most common cause of cancer deaths. The 5-year relative survival for bladder cancers diagnosed between 2000 and 2007 is 69%. Geographic variation is seen in survival rates with 5-year survival rates of 75% in Northern to 65% in Eastern Europe.<ref></ref>
===United Kingdom===
Bladder cancer is the ninth most common cancer in the UK accounting for 2.7% of all the new cancers cases. In 2018, there was 12,200 new cases and 6100 people died from it.<ref></ref>
===United States===
In the United States in 2019 80,470 cases and 17,670 deaths are expected making it the sixth most common type of cancer in the region.<ref name=SEER2019/> Bladder cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer in men and the 12th most common cancer in women.<ref></ref> Around 62,000 men and 19,000 women are diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2019.<ref></ref> Between 2012 and 2016 annual rate of new bladder cancer cases decreased by one percent per year.<ref></ref>
