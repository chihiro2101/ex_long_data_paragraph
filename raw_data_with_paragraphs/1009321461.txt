Laryngeal theory

==History==
The beginnings of the theory were proposed by Ferdinand de Saussure in 1879, in an article chiefly devoted to something else altogether (demonstrating that *a and *o were separate phonemes in PIE).
In the course of his analysis, Saussure proposed that what had then been reconstructed as long vowels *ƒÅ and *≈ç, alternating with *«ù, was an ordinary type of PIE ablaut. That is, it was an alternation between e-grade and zero grade like in "regular" ablaut (further explanations below), but followed by a previously unidentified element. This "element" accounted for both the changed vowel colour and the lengthening (short *e becoming long *ƒÅ or *≈ç).
So, rather than reconstructing *ƒÅ, *≈ç and *«ù as others had done before, Saussure proposed something like *eA alternating with *A and *eO with *O, where A and O represented the unidentified elements. Saussure called them simply "coefficients sonantiques", which was the term for what are now in English more usually called resonants; that is, the six elements present in PIE which can be either consonants (non-syllabic) or vowels (syllabic) depending on the sounds they are adjacent to: *y w r l m n.
These views were accepted by a few scholars, in particular Hermann M√∂ller, who added important elements to the theory. Saussure's observations, however, did not achieve any general currency, as they were still too abstract and had little direct evidence to back them up.
This changed when Hittite was discovered and deciphered in the early 20th&nbsp;century. Hittite phonology included two sounds written with symbols from the Akkadian syllabary conventionally transcribed as , as in "I put, am putting". This consonant did not appear to be related to any of the consonants then reconstructed for PIE, and various unsatisfactory proposals were made to explain this consonant in terms of the PIE consonant system as it had then been reconstructed.
It remained for Jerzy Kury≈Çowicz<ref></ref> to propose that these sounds lined up with Saussure's conjectures. He suggested that the unknown consonant of Hittite was, in fact, a direct reflex of the coefficients sonantiques that Saussure had proposed.
Their appearance explained some other matters as well: For example, why verb roots containing only a consonant and a vowel always have long vowels. For example, in *d≈ç- "give", the new consonants allowed linguists to decompose this further into *deh‚ÇÉ. This not only accounted for the patterns of alternation more economically than before (by requiring fewer types of ablaut) but also brought the structure of these roots into line with the basic PIE pattern which required roots to begin and end with a consonant.
The lateness of the discovery of these sounds by Indo-Europeanists is largely because Hittite and the other Anatolian languages are the only Indo-European languages for which at least some are attested directly and consistently as consonantal sounds. Otherwise, their presence is to be inferred mostly through the effects they have on neighboring sounds, and on patterns of alternation that they participate in. When a laryngeal is attested directly, it is usually as a special type of vowel and not as a consonant, best exemplified in Greek where syllabic laryngeals (when they appeared next to only consonants) developed as such: *h‚ÇÅ > e, *h‚ÇÇ > a, and *h‚ÇÉ > o.
==Varieties of laryngeals==
There are many variations of the laryngeal theory. Some scholars, such as Oswald Szemer√©nyi, reconstruct just one laryngeal. Some follow Jaan Puhvel's reconstruction of eight or more.<ref><br/>
</ref>
===Basic Laryngeal Set===
Most scholars work with a basic three:
*, the "neutral" laryngeal
*, the "a-colouring" laryngeal
*, the "o-colouring" laryngeal
===Additional Laryngeals===
*
Some scholars suggest the existence of a fourth consonant, , which differs from in not being reflected as Anatolian <ref>Zair, N., The Reflexes of the Proto-Indo-European Laryngeals in Celtic (Brill, 2012), pp. 3-4.</ref><ref name="MalloryAdams2006"></ref> but being reflected, to the exclusion of all other laryngeals, as Albanian h when word-initial before an originally stressed vowel.<ref>Encyclopedia of Indo-European culture By J. P. Mallory, Douglas Q. Adams Edition: illustrated Published by Taylor & Francis, 1997 , p. 462.</ref>
E.g. PIE *h‚ÇÑ√≥r«µ ∞iyeh‚ÇÇ "testicle" yields Albanian herdhe "testicle" but Hittite arki- "testicle" whereas PIE "bear" yields Alb. ari "bear" but Hittite hart(ag)ga- (=/hartka-/) "cultic official, bear-person".<ref>Encyclopedia of Indo-European culture By J. P. Mallory, Douglas Q. Adams Edition: illustrated Published by Taylor & Francis, 1997 , pp. 9-10, 13-14, 55.</ref><ref name="MalloryAdams2006" />
When there is an uncertainty whether the laryngeal is or , the symbol may be used.<ref name="MalloryAdams2006" />
* Doublet
Another such theory, but much less generally accepted, is Winfred P. Lehmann's view, based on inconsistent reflexes in Hittite, that was two separate sounds. (He assumed that one was a glottal stop and the other a glottal fricative.)
==Direct evidence for laryngeals==
Some direct evidence for laryngeal consonants comes from Anatolian:
PIE *a is a fairly rare sound, and in an uncommonly large number of good etymologies, it is word-initial. Thus PIE (traditional) *anti "in front of and facing" > Greek ant√≠ "against"; Latin ante "in front of, before"; Sanskrit √°nti "near; in the presence of". But in Hittite there is a noun "front, face", with various derivatives (·∏´antezzi "first", and so on), pointing to a PIE root-noun "face" (of which would be the locative singular). (It does not necessarily follow that all reconstructed forms with initial *a should automatically be rewritten .)
Similarly, the traditional PIE reconstruction for 'sheep' is *owi- (a y-stem, not an i-stem) whence Sanskrit √°vi-, Latin ovis, Greek ·ΩÑœäœÇ. But Luwian has ·∏´awi-, indicating instead a reconstruction .
==Pronunciation==
Considerable debate still surrounds the pronunciation of the laryngeals and various arguments have been given to pinpoint their exact place of articulation. Firstly the effect these sounds have had on adjacent phonemes is well documented. The evidence from Hittite and Uralic is sufficient to conclude that these sounds were "guttural" or pronounced rather back in the vocal tract. The same evidence is also consistent with the assumption that they were fricative sounds (as opposed to approximants or stops), an assumption that is strongly supported by the behaviour of laryngeals in consonant clusters.
===*h‚ÇÅ===
Jens Elmeg√•rd Rasmussen (1983) suggested a consonantal realization for *h‚ÇÅ as the voiceless glottal fricative with a syllabic allophone (mid central unrounded vowel).<ref name="r77">Rasmussen (1999), p. 77</ref> This is supported by the closeness of to (with which it combines in Greek),<ref>Rasmussen (1999), p. 71</ref> its failure (unlike *h‚ÇÇ and *h‚ÇÉ) to create an auxiliary vowel in Greek and Tocharian when it occurs between a semivowel and a consonant,<ref name="r76"/> and the typological likelihood of an given the presence of aspirated consonants in PIE.<ref name="r76">Rasmussen (1999), p.&nbsp;76</ref>
It has been suggested by Beekes (1995) that *h‚ÇÅ is a glottal stop . However, Winfred P. Lehmann instead theorized, based on inconsistent reflexes in Hittite, that there were two *h‚ÇÅ sounds: a glottal stop and an h sound as in English hat.
In 2004, Alwin Kloekhorst<ref></ref> argued that the Hieroglyphic Luwian sign no.&nbsp;19 (îêì, conventionally transcribed √°) stood for / îa/ (distinct from /a/, sign no.&nbsp;450: îó∑ a) and represents the reflex of ; this would support the hypothesis that , or at least some cases of it, was . Later, Kloekhorst (2006)<ref></ref> claimed that also Hittite preserves PIE *h‚ÇÅ as a glottal stop , visible in words like Hittite e-e≈°-zi 'he is' < PIE *h‚ÇÅ√©s-ti, where an extra initial vowel sign is used (so-called plene spelling). This hypothesis has met with serious criticism [e.g. Rieken (2010),<ref></ref> Melchert (2010),<ref></ref> and Weeden (2011).<ref></ref>
Recently, however, Simon (2010)<ref></ref> has supported Kloekhorst's thesis by suggesting that plene spelling in Cuneiform Luwian can be explained in a similar way. Additionally, Simon's (2013) article revises the Hieroglyphic Luwian evidence and concludes that "although some details of Kloekhorst's arguments could not be maintained, his theory can be confirmed."<ref></ref>
An occasionally advanced idea is that the laryngeals were dorsal fricatives corresponding directly to the three traditionally reconstructed series of dorsal stops ("palatal", velar, and labiovelar) suggests a further possibility, a palatal fricative .
===*h‚ÇÇ===
From what is known of such phonetic conditioning in contemporary languages, notably Semitic languages, *h‚ÇÇ (the "a-colouring" laryngeal) could have been a pharyngeal fricative such as and . Pharyngeal consonants (like the Arabic letter ÿ≠ (ƒß) as in Muƒßammad) often cause a-colouring in the Semitic languages.<ref></ref> Uvular fricatives, however, may also colour vowels, thus is also a noteworthy candidate. Weiss (2016) suggests that this was the case in Proto-Indo-European proper, and that a shift from uvular into pharyngeal may have been a common innovation of the non-Anatolian languages (before the consonant's eventual loss).<ref></ref> Rasmussen (1983) suggested a consonantal realization for *h‚ÇÇ as a voiceless velar fricative , with a syllabic allophone , i.e. a near-open central vowel.<ref name="r77"/>
===*h‚ÇÉ===
Likewise it is generally assumed that *h‚ÇÉ was rounded (labialized) due to its o-colouring effects. It is often taken to have been voiced based on the perfect form *pi-bh‚ÇÉ- from the root *peh‚ÇÉ "drink". Rasmussen has chosen a consonantal realization for *h‚ÇÉ as a voiced labialized velar fricative , with a syllabic allophone , i.e. a close-mid central rounded vowel.<ref name="r77"/> K√ºmmel instead suggests .<ref></ref>
==Support for theory from daughter languages==
The hypothetical existence of laryngeals in PIE finds support in the body of daughter language cognates which can be most efficiently explained through simple rules of development.
===Direct reflexes of laryngeals===
Unambiguous examples are confined to Anatolian languages. Words with Hittite ·∏´ (hh), Luwian h and Lycian x are explained as reflexes of PIE roots with h‚ÇÇ.<ref>Clackson p. 56.</ref>
::
 = syllabic form of the mystery element)
Saussure treated only two of these elements, corresponding to our *h‚ÇÇ and *h‚ÇÉ. Later it was noticed that the explanatory power of the theory, as well as its elegance, were enhanced if a third element were added, our *h‚ÇÅ, which has the same lengthening and syllabifying properties as the other two but has no effect on the colour of adjacent vowels. Saussure did not suggest as to the phonetics of these elements; his term for them, "coefficients sonantiques", was not however a fudge, but merely the term in general use for glides, nasals, and liquids (i.e., the PIE resonants) as in roots like *bher-.
As mentioned above, in forms like *dwi-bhr-o- (etymon of Greek diphr√≥s, above), the new "coefficients sonantiques" (unlike the six resonants) have no reflexes at all in any daughter language. Thus the compound *- "to 'fix thought', be devout, become rapt" forms a noun *- seen in Proto-Indo-Iranian *mazdha- whence Sanskrit medh√°- /mƒìdha/ "sacrificial rite, holiness" (regular development as in sedur < *sazdur, above), Avestan mazda- "name (originally an epithet) of the greatest deity".
====Root *bhendh====
There is another kind of unproblematic root, in which obstruents flank a resonant. In the zero grade, unlike the case with roots of the *bher- type, the resonant is therefore always syllabic (being always between two consonants). An example would be *bhendh- "tie, bind":
**bhendh-: in Germanic forms like Old English bindan "to tie, bind", Gothic bindan; Lithuanian be√±dras "chum", Greek peƒ©sma "rope, cable" /p√™Àêsma/ < *phenth-sma < *bhendh-sm·πá.
**bhondh-: in Sanskrit bandh√°- "bond, fastening" (*bhondh-o-; Grassmann's law) = Old Icelandic bant, OE b√¶nd; Old English b√¶nd, Gothic band "he tied" < *(bhe)bhondh-e.
*-: in Sanskrit baddh√°- < *- (Bartholomae's law), Old English gebunden, Gothic bundan; German Bund "league". (English bind and bound show the effects of secondary (Middle English) vowel lengthening; the original length is preserved in bundle.)
This is all straightforward and such roots fit directly into the overall patterns. Less so are certain roots that seem sometimes to go like the *bher- type, and sometimes to be unlike anything else, with (for example) long syllabics in the zero grades while at times pointing to a two-vowel root structure. These roots are variously called "heavy bases", "dis(s)yllabic roots", and "se·π≠ roots" (the last being a term from PƒÅ·πáini's grammar. It will be explained below).
====Root *«µen, *«µon, *«µ·πán-/*«µ·πáÃÑ====
For example, the root "be born, arise" is given in the usual etymological dictionaries as follows:
*(A) -
*(B) -
The (A) forms occur when the root is followed by an affix beginning with a vowel; the (B) forms when the affix begins with a consonant. As mentioned, the full-grade (A) forms look just like the *bher- type, but the zero grades always and only have reflexes of syllabic resonants, just like the *bhendh- type; and unlike any other type, there is a second root vowel (always and only *…ô) following the second consonant:
;*«µen(…ô)-
*(A) PIE *«µenos- neut s-stem "race, clan" > Greek (Homeric) g√©nos, -eos, Sanskrit j√°nas-, Avestan zan≈ç, Latin genus, -eris.
*(B) Greek gen√©-tƒìs "begetter, father"; g√©ne-sis < *«µen…ô-ti- "origin"; Sanskrit j√°ni-man- "birth, lineage", j√°ni-tar- "progenitor, father", Latin genitus "begotten" < genatos.
;*«µon(e)-
*(A) Sanskrit janayati "beget" = Old English cennan /kennan/ < *«µon-eye- (causative); Sanskrit j√°na- "race" (o-grade o-stem) = Greek g√≥nos, -ou "offspring".
*(B) Sanskrit jajƒÅna 3sg. "was born" < *«µe-«µon-e.
;*«µ·πán-/*«µ·πáÃÑ-
*(A) Gothic kuni "clan, family" = OE cynn /k√ºnn/, English kin; Rigvedic jajan√∫r 3pl.perfect < *- (a relic; the regular Sanskrit form in paradigms like this is jaj√±ur, a remodelling).
*(B) Sanskrit jƒÅt√°- "born" = Latin nƒÅtus (Old Latin gnƒÅtus, and cf. forms like cognƒÅtus "related by birth", Greek kas√≠-gnƒìtos "brother"); Greek gn·∏ósios "belonging to the race". (The ƒì in these Greek forms can be shown to be original, not Attic-Ionic developments from Proto-Greek *ƒÅ.)
On the term "se·π≠". The PƒÅ·πáinian term "se·π≠" (that is, sa-i-·π≠) is literally "with an /i/". This refers to the fact that roots so designated, like jan- "be born", have an /i/ between the root and the suffix, as we've seen in Sanskrit j√°nitar-, j√°niman-, janitva (a gerund). Cf. such formations built to "ani·π≠" ("without an /i/") roots, such as han- "slay": h√°ntar- "slayer", hanman- "a slaying", hantva (gerund). In PƒÅ·πáini's analysis, this /i/ is a linking vowel, not properly a part of either the root or the suffix. It is simply that some roots are in effect in the list consisting of the roots that (as we would put it) "take an -i-".
But historians have the advantage here: the peculiarities of alternation, the "presence of /i/", and the fact that the only vowel allowed in second place in a root happens to be *…ô, are all neatly explained once *«µen…ô- and the like were understood to be properly *«µenH-. That is, the patterns of alternation, from of Indo-European, were simply those of *bhendh-, with the additional detail that *H, unlike obstruents (stops and *s) would become a syllable between two consonants, hence the *«µen…ô- shape in the Type (B) formations, above.
====Discussion====
The startling reflexes of these roots in zero-grade before a consonant (in this case, Sanskrit ƒÅ, Greek nƒì, Latin nƒÅ, Lithuanian √¨n) is explained by the lengthening of the (originally perfectly ordinary) syllabic resonant before the lost laryngeal, while the same laryngeal protects the syllabic status of the preceding resonant even before an affix beginning with a vowel: the archaic Vedic form jajanur cited above is structurally quite the same (* as a form like * "they saw" < *.
Incidentally, redesigning the root as *«µenH- has another consequence. Several of the Sanskrit forms cited above come from what look like o-grade root vowels in open syllables, but fail to lengthen to -ƒÅ- per Brugmann's law. All becomes clear when it is understood that in such forms as *«µonH- before a vowel, the *o is not in fact in an open syllable. And in turn, that means that a form like jajƒÅna "was born", which apparently does show the action of Brugmann's law, is a false witness: in the Sanskrit perfect tense, the whole class of se·π≠ roots, en masse, acquired the shape of the ani·π≠ 3sing. forms. (See Brugmann's law for further discussion.)
====Other roots====
There are also roots ending in a stop followed by a laryngeal, as *- "spread, flatten", from which Sanskrit - "broad" masc. (= Avestan p…ôr…ôŒ∏u-), p·πõthivƒ´- fem., Greek plat√∫s (zero grade); Skt. prathim√°n- "wideness" (full grade), Greek platam·πìn "flat stone". The laryngeal explains (a) the change of *t to *th in Proto-Indo-Iranian, (b) the correspondence between Greek -a-, Sanskrit -i- and no vowel in Avestan (Avestan p…ôr…ôŒ∏wƒ´ "broad" fem. in two syllables vs Sanskrit p·πõthivƒ´- in three).
::Caution has to be used in interpreting data from Indic in particular. Sanskrit remained in use as a poetic, scientific, and classical language for many centuries, and the multitude of inherited patterns of alternation of obscure motivation (such as the division into se·π≠ and ani·π≠ roots) provided models for coining new forms on the "wrong" patterns. There are many forms like t·πõ·π£ita- "thirsty" and t√°niman- "slenderness", that is, se·π≠ formations to unequivocally ani·π≠ roots; and conversely ani·π≠ forms like p√≠parti "fills", p·πõta- "filled", to securely se·π≠ roots (cf. the "real" past participle, p≈´r·πá√°-). Sanskrit preserves the effects of laryngeal phonology with wonderful clarity but looks upon the historical linguist with a threatening eye: for even in Vedic Sanskrit, the evidence has to be weighed carefully with due concern for the antiquity of the forms and the overall texture of the data. (It is no help that Proto-Indo-European itself had roots which varied somewhat in their makeup, as *«µhew- and *«µhewd-, both "pour"; and some of these "root extensions" as they're called, for want of any more analytical term, are, unluckily, laryngeals.)
Stray laryngeals can be found in isolated or seemingly isolated forms; here the three-way Greek reflexes of syllabic *h‚ÇÅ, *h‚ÇÇ, *h‚ÇÉ are particularly helpful, as seen below. (Comments on the forms follow.)
* in Greek √°nemos "wind" (cf. Latin animus "breath, spirit; mind", Vedic aniti "breathes") < *an…ô- "breathe; blow" (now *h‚ÇÇenh‚ÇÅ-). Perhaps also Greek h√≠eros "mighty, super-human; divine; holy", cf. Sanskrit i·π£ir√°- "vigorous, energetic".
* in Greek pat·∏ór "father" = Sanskrit pit√°r-, Old English f√¶der, Gothic fadar, Latin pater. Also * "big" neut. > Greek m√©ga, Sanskrit m√°ha.
* in Greek √°rotron "plow" = Welsh aradr, Old Norse ar√∞r, Lithuanian √°rklas.
==Comments==
The Greek forms √°nemos and √°rotron are particularly valuable because the verb roots in question are extinct in Greek as verbs. This means that there is no possibility of some sort of analogical interference, for example, happened in the case of Latin arƒÅtrum "plow", whose shape has been distorted by the verb arƒÅre "to plow" (the exact cognate to the Greek form would have been *aretrum). It used to be standard to explain the root vowels of Greek thet√≥s, stat√≥s, dot√≥s "put, stood, given" as analogical. Most scholars nowadays probably take them as original, but in the case of "wind" and "plow", the argument can't even come up.
Regarding Greek h√≠eros, the pseudo-participle affix *-ro- is added directly to the verb root, so *- > *isero- > *ihero- > h√≠eros (with regular throwback of the aspiration to the beginning of the word), and Sanskrit i·π£ir√°-. There seems to be no question of the existence of a root *eysH- "vigorously move/cause to move". If the thing began with a laryngeal, and most scholars would agree that it did, it would have to be *h‚ÇÅ-, specifically; and that's a problem. A root of the shape *h‚ÇÅeysh‚ÇÅ- is not possible. Indo-European had no roots of the type *mem-, *tet-, *dhredh-, i.e., with two copies of the same consonant. But Greek attests an earlier (and rather more widely attested) form of the same meaning, h√≠aros. If we reconstruct *h‚ÇÅeysh‚ÇÇ-, all of our problems are solved in one stroke. The explanation for the h√≠eros/h√≠aros business has long been discussed, without much result; laryngeal theory now provides the opportunity for an explanation which did not exist before, namely the metathesis of the two laryngeals. It is still only a guess, but it is a much simpler and more elegant guess than the guesses available before.
The syllabic * in *- "father" might not be isolated. Certain evidence shows that the kinship affix seen in "mother, father" etc. might have been *-h‚ÇÇter- instead of *-ter-. The laryngeal syllabified after a consonant (thus Greek pat·∏ór, Latin pater, Sanskrit pit√°r-; Greek thug√°tƒìr, Sanskrit duhit√°r- "daughter") but lengthened a preceding vowel (thus say Latin mƒÅter "mother", frƒÅter "brother") ‚Äî even when the "vowel" in question was a syllabic resonant, as in Sanskrit yƒÅtaras "husbands' wives" < *- < *-).
==Laryngeals in morphology==
Like any other consonant, Laryngeals feature in the endings of verbs and nouns and derivational morphology, the only difference being the greater difficulty of telling what's going on. Indo-Iranian, for example, can retain forms that pretty clearly reflect a laryngeal, but there is no way of knowing which one.
The following is a rundown of laryngeals in Proto-Indo-European morphology.
**h‚ÇÅ is seen in the instrumental ending (probably originally indifferent to number, like English expressions of the type by hand and on foot). In Sanskrit, feminine i- and u-stems have instrumentals in -ƒ´, -≈´, respectively. In the Rigveda, there are a few old a-stems (PIE o-stems) with an instrumental in -ƒÅ; but even in that oldest text the usual ending is -enƒÅ, from the n-stems.
::Greek has some adverbs in -ƒì, but more important are the Mycenaean forms like e-re-pa-te "with ivory" (i.e. elephantƒì? -ƒõ?)
::The marker of the neuter dual was *-iH, as in Sanskrit bharatƒ´ "two carrying ones (neut.)", nƒÅmanƒ´ "two names", yuge "two yokes" (< yuga-i? *yuga-ƒ´?). Greek to the rescue: the Homeric form √≥sse "the (two) eyes" is manifestly from *h‚ÇÉek ∑-ih‚ÇÅ (formerly *ok ∑-ƒ´) via fully regular sound laws (intermediately *ok ∑ye).
::*-eh‚ÇÅ- derives stative verb senses from eventive roots: PIE *sed- "sit (down)": *sed-eh‚ÇÅ- "be in a sitting position" (> Proto-Italic *sed-ƒì-ye-mos "we are sitting" > Latin sedƒìmus). It is attested in Celtic, Italic, Germanic (the Class IV weak verbs), and Baltic/Slavic, with some traces in Indo-Iranian (In Avestan the affix seems to form past-habitual stems).
::It seems likely, though it is less certain, that this same *-h‚ÇÅ underlies the nominative-accusative dual in o-stems: Sanskrit v·πõkƒÅ, Greek l√∫k≈ç "two wolves". (The alternative ending -ƒÅu in Sanskrit cuts a small figure in the Rigveda, but eventually becomes the standard form of the o-stem dual.)
::*-h‚ÇÅs- derives desiderative stems as in Sanskrit jighƒÅ·πÉsati "desires to slay" < *g ∑hi-g ∑h·πá-h‚ÇÅs-e-ti- (root *g ∑hen-, Sanskrit han- "slay"). This is the source of Greek future tense formations and (with the addition of a thematic suffix *-ye/o-) the Indo-Iranian one as well: bhari·π£yati "will carry" < *bher-h‚ÇÅs-ye-ti.
::*-yeh‚ÇÅ-/*-ih‚ÇÅ- is the optative suffix for root verb inflections, e.g. Latin (old) siet "may he be", sƒ´mus "may we be", Sanskrit syƒÅt "may he be", and so on.
**h‚ÇÇ is seen as the marker of the neuter plural: *-h‚ÇÇ in the consonant stems, *-eh‚ÇÇ in the vowel stems. Much levelling and remodelling are seen in the daughter languages that preserve any ending at all, thus Latin has generalized *-ƒÅ throughout the noun system (later regularly shortened to -a), Greek generalized -«é < *-h‚ÇÇ.
::The categories "masculine/feminine" plainly did not exist in the most original form of Proto-Indo-European, and there are very few noun types which are formally different in the two genders. The formal differences are mostly to be seen in adjectives (and not all of them) and pronouns. Both types of derived feminine stems feature *h‚ÇÇ: a type that is patently derived from the o-stem nominals; and an ablauting type showing alternations between *-yeh‚ÇÇ- and *-ih‚ÇÇ-. Both are peculiar in having no actual marker for the nominative singular, and at least as far as the *-eh‚ÇÇ- type, two things seem clear: it is based on the o-stems, and the nom.sg. is probably in origin a neuter plural. (An archaic trait of Indo-European morpho-syntax is that plural neuter nouns construe with singular verbs, and quite possibly *yugeh‚ÇÇ was not so much "yokes" in our sense, but "yokage; a harnessing-up".) Once that much is thought of, however, it is not easy to pin down the details of the "ƒÅ-stems" in the Indo-European languages outside of Anatolia, and such an analysis sheds no light at all on the *-yeh‚ÇÇ-/*-ih‚ÇÇ- stems, which (like the *eh‚ÇÇ-stems) form feminine adjective stems and derived nouns (e.g. Sanskrit devƒ´- "goddess" from deva- "god") but unlike the "ƒÅ-stems" have no foundation in any neuter category.
::*-eh‚ÇÇ- seems to have formed factitive verbs, as in *new-eh‚ÇÇ- "to renew, make new again", as seen in Latin novƒÅre, Greek ne√°≈ç and Hittite ne-wa-a·∏´-·∏´a-an-t- (participle) all "renew" but all three with the pregnant sense of "plow anew; return fallow land to cultivation".
::*-h‚ÇÇ- marked the 1st person singular, with a somewhat confusing distribution: in the thematic active (the familiar -≈ç ending of Greek and Latin, and Indo-Iranian -ƒÅ(mi)), and also in the perfect tense (not really a tense in PIE): *-h‚ÇÇe as in Greek o√Æda "I know" < *woyd-h‚ÇÇe. It is the basis of the Hittite ending -·∏´·∏´i, as in da-a·∏´-·∏´i "I take" < *-·∏´a-i (original *-·∏´a embellished with the primary tense marker with subsequent smoothing of the diphthong).
**-eh‚ÇÉ may be tentatively identified in a "directive case". No such case is found in Indo-European noun paradigms, but such a construct accounts for a curious collection of Hittite forms like ne-pi-≈°a "(in)to the sky", t√°k-na-a "to, into the ground", a-ru-na "to the sea". These are sometimes explained as o-stem datives in -a < *-≈çy, an ending attested in Greek and Indo-Iranian, among others, but there are serious problems with such a view, and the forms are highly coherent, functionally. And there are also appropriate adverbs in Greek and Latin (elements lost in productive paradigms sometimes survive in stray forms, like the old instrumental case of the definite article in English expressions like the more the merrier): Greek √°n≈ç "upwards, k√°t≈ç "downwards", Latin qu≈ç "whither?", e≈ç "to that place"; and perhaps even the Indic preposition/preverb √¢ "to(ward)" which has no satisfactory competing etymology. (These forms must be distinguished from the similar-looking ones formed to the ablative in *-≈çd and with a distinctive "fromness" sense: Greek √≥p≈ç "whence, from where".)
==Criticism==
Throughout its history, the laryngeal theory in its various forms has been subject to extensive criticism and revision.
The original argument of Saussure was not accepted by anyone in the Neogrammarian school, primarily based at the University of Leipzig, then reigning at the cutting-edge of Indo-European linguistics. Several of them attacked the M√©moire savagely. Osthoff's criticism was particularly virulent, often descending into personal invective.<ref name="demauro"></ref>
For the first half-century of its existence, the laryngeal theory was widely seen as ‚Äòan eccentric fancy of outsiders‚Äô. In Germany it was roundly rejected. Among its early proponents were Hermann M√∂ller, who extended Saussure's system with a third, non-colouring laryngeal, Albert Cuny, Holger Pedersen, and Karl O≈°tir. The fact that these scholars were engaged in highly speculative long-range linguistic comparison further contributed to its isolation.
Although the founding fathers were able to provide some indirect evidence of a lost consonantal element (for example, the origin of the Indo-Iranian voiceless aspirates in *CH sequences and the ablaut pattern of the so-called heavy bases, *CeR…ô- ~ *CRÃ•ÃÑ- in the traditional formulation<ref></ref>), the direct evidence so crucial for the Neogrammarian thinking was lacking. Saussure's structural considerations were foreign to the leading contemporary linguists.<ref name="demauro"/>
After Kury≈Çowicz's convincing demonstration<ref></ref> that the Hittite language preserved at least some of Saussure's coefficients sonantiques, the focus of the debate shifted. It was still unclear how many laryngeals are to be posited to account for the new facts and what effect they have had exactly. Kury≈Çowicz, after a while, settled on four laryngeals,<ref></ref> an approach further accepted by Sapir, Sturtevant, and through them much of American linguistics. The three-laryngeal system was defended, among others, by Walter Couvreur and √âmile Benveniste. Many individual proposals were made, which assumed up to ten laryngeals (Andr√© Martinet). While some scholars, like Heinz Kronasser and Giuliano Bonfante, attempted to disregard Anatolian evidence altogether, the ‚Äòminimal‚Äô serious proposal (with roots in Pedersen's early ideas) was put forward by Hans Hendriksen, Louis Hammerich and later Ladislav Zgusta, who assumed a single /H/ phoneme without vowel-colouring effects.
By the 2000s, however, a widespread, though not unanimous, agreement was reached in the field on reconstructing M√∂ller's three laryngeals.<ref></ref> One of the last major critics of this approach was Oswald Szemer√©nyi, who subscribed to a theory similar to Zgusta's .
Today the laryngeal theory is almost universally accepted in this new standard form. Nevertheless, marginal attempts to undermine its bases are occasionally undertaken.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

The laryngeal theory is a widely accepted hypothesis in the historical linguistics of the Indo-European languages positing that:
*Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) had a series of phonemes beyond those reconstructable by the comparative method.
* These phonemes, according to the most-accepted variant of the theory, were "laryngeal" consonants of an indeterminate place of articulation towards the back of the mouth.
The theory aims to:
* Produce greater regularity in the reconstruction of PIE phonology than from the reconstruction that is produced by the comparative method. 
*Extend the general occurrence of the Indo-European ablaut to syllables with reconstructed vowel phonemes other than *e or *o.
In its earlier form (#History), the theory proposed two sounds in PIE. Combined with a reconstructed *e or *o, the sounds produce vowel phonemes that would not otherwise be predicted by the rules of ablaut. The theory received considerable support after the decipherment of Hittite, which revealed it to be an Indo-European language.
Many Hittite words were shown to be derived from PIE, with a phoneme represented as ·∏´ corresponding to one of the hypothetical PIE sounds. Subsequent scholarship has established a set of rules by which an ever-increasing number of reflexes in daughter languages may be derived from PIE roots. The number of explanations thus achieved and the simplicity of the postulated system have both led to widespread acceptance of the theory.
In its most widely accepted version, the theory posits three phonemes in PIE: h‚ÇÅ, h‚ÇÇ, and h‚ÇÉ (see below). Other daughter languages inherited the derived sounds, resulting from their merger with PIE short vowels and their subsequent loss.
The phonemes are now recognized as consonants, related to articulation in the general area of the larynx, where a consonantal gesture may affect vowel quality. They are regularly known as laryngeal, but the actual place of articulation for each consonant remains a matter of debate. (see below).
The laryngeals got their name because they were believed by Hermann M√∂ller and Albert Cuny to have had a pharyngeal, epiglottal, or glottal place of articulation, involving a constriction near the larynx. While this is still possible, many linguists now think of "laryngeals", or some of them, as having been velar or uvular.
The evidence for their existence is mostly indirect, as will be shown below, but the theory serves as an elegant explanation for several properties of the PIE vowel system that made no sense until the theory, such as the "independent" schwas (as in *p…ôter- 'father'). Also, the hypothesis that PIE schwa *…ô was a consonant, not a vowel, provides an elegant explanation for some apparent exceptions to Brugmann's law in Indic languages.
