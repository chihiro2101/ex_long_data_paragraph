===Tucson memorial===

===Discrimination lawsuit===
In July 2012, Napolitano was accused of allowing discrimination against male staffers within the Department of Homeland Security.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The federal discrimination lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, was filled by James Hayes Jr., at the time a special agent of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in New York City.<ref></ref> The suit alleged that managers Dora Schriro and Suzanne Barr mistreated male staffers, and that promotions were given to women who were friends of Napolitano. The suit also claimed that when the abuse was reported to the Equal Employment Opportunity office Napolitano launched a series of misconduct investigations against the reporting party, Hayes.<ref></ref> This allegation was never proven. The spokesperson for ICE declined to comment on "unfounded claims".<ref></ref>
Suzanne Barr, who was one of Napolitano's first appointments after she became secretary in 2009, went on leave after Hayes filed his lawsuit and resigned on September 1, 2012. She called the allegations in the lawsuit "unfounded."<ref></ref> In November 2012, Hayes' attorney said that the "parties have come to an agreement in principle" to settle the case for $175,000 plus a settlement that would include other conditions, including Hayes keeping his job.<ref></ref>
Napolitano was also sued by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who claims he was pulled from his post at JFK Airport after making a series of employment-discrimination complaints.<ref></ref>
===DACA and comprehensive immigration reform===
Napolitano was a long-term advocate for comprehensive immigration reform, starting with her terms as governor of Arizona.<ref></ref> In 2012, in an effort to provide relief for the so-called DREAM Act population, or DREAMers, Napolitano used prosecutorial discretion to create the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA).<ref></ref> DREAMers were brought to the U.S. by their parents as minors and have no experience of living in their countries of citizenship.<ref></ref> The program deferred removal proceedings against DREAMers, providing them with the legal status to remain in the United States without fear of deportation.
DACA was announced by President Obama in a Rose Garden ceremony shortly after its creation. It was criticized by some members of Congress as an abuse of executive authority.<ref></ref>&nbsp; Napolitano's successor, Jeh Johnson, later attempted to expand the program to include parents of DREAMers, but that expansion was subsequently overturned in courts.<ref></ref> DACA remains in place and has never been found unconstitutional by a U.S. court.<ref></ref>
==University of California==
In July 2013, Napolitano announced she would leave her post as Secretary of Homeland Security to become president of the University of California (UC).<ref name="Washington Times"></ref><ref name="NBC News"></ref> She was appointed the 20th president by the University of California Board of Regents on July 18, 2013, the first woman to lead the University of California,<ref></ref> and began her tenure as president on September 30, 2013.<ref></ref> On September 18, 2019, Napolitano announced her resignation as president, effective August 1, 2020.

Among her first acts as president was the allocation of more support for UC's undocumented students, and expanded efforts to diversify the ranks of UC graduate students and post-doctoral researchers.<ref></ref> She also initiated an ambitious ongoing plan for the ten-campus system to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025, saying that it was a 'moral imperative' for UC to find solutions to global climate change. In seeking to reduce UC's carbon footprint to zero, Napolitano authorized the university to register as an Electric Service Provider, allowing it to supply energy directly to some of its campuses and medical centers from an 80-MW solar farm in Fresno.<ref></ref> In 2017, Napolitano was awarded the Pat Brown Award from the California Council for Environmental and Economic Balance for her environmental leadership.<ref></ref>
Napolitano has used her tenure as president to encourage more students to pursue public interest careers. She created a fund for fellowships for undergraduate students to offset costs related to public service internships in Sacramento and Washington D.C. She also created the President's Public Service Law Fellowship program, which awards $4.5 million annually to law students at UC Berkeley, UC Davis, Uc irvine and UCLA to make postgraduate work and summer positions more accessible for students who wish to pursue public interest legal careers but might be forced to seek private sector jobs out of financial need.<ref></ref>
As part of her Global Food Initiative, which was launched in 2014, Napolitano committed $3.3 million to help students at the University of California access nutritious food. At the time it was the nation's most comprehensive, systematic plan to tackle the problem of food insecurity.<ref></ref>
Napolitano has led efforts to combat sexual violence and harassment at the University of California through improvements to the system's policies and procedures.&nbsp;On March 7, 2014 Napolitano wrote a letter to the UC community announcing a new presidential policy prohibiting sexual harassment and violence and providing support for victims and training for faculty, staff and students.<ref></ref> She also created a system-wide Title IX office and appointed the first system-wide Title IX coordinator in January 2017.<ref></ref>
On October 26, 2017 the University of California announced the establishment of the National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement. Chaired by Napolitano, the center is devoted to research, education and advocacy on issues of free speech and civic engagement.<ref></ref>
During Napolitano's time as president of UC, tuition for undergraduates has held steady, with one tuition increase of $282 in 2017.<ref></ref>
===Controversies===
In April 2016, Napolitano placed Linda Katehi, the chancellor of UC Davis, on administrative leave following revelations that UC Davis attempted to suppress web searches relating to the UC Davis pepper-spray incident, as well as charges of nepotism and allegation of misuse of student funds.<ref></ref>
On April 25, 2017 the California State Auditor issued a report that Janet Napolitano and her University of California Office of the President failed to disclose $175 million and engaged in misleading budget practices<ref></ref> After an investigation, the University of California took disciplinary action against Napolitano, issuing a public admonishment.<ref name="San Francisco Chronicle"></ref> According to an independent report by retired State Supreme Justice Carlos R.

On September 8, 2017 the University of California and Janet Napolitano filed a lawsuit against the United States Federal Government in response to President Trump's decision to ultimately end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA,<ref></ref>&nbsp;making her the first former Secretary of Homeland Security to sue the agency she once led over a policy that she created.<ref></ref>
In 2020, Janet Napolitano fired 82 UC Santa Cruz graduate students for withholding grades in a wildcat strike for a Cost of Living Adjustment to address untenable living conditions.<ref></ref> Dismissed students also face loss of tuition remission, health benefits, and living stipends in one of the most expensive counties in the United States, and international students face loss of student visa status.
