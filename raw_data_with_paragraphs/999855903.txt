Christopher Isherwood

== Biography ==
=== Early life and work ===
Isherwood was born in 1904 on his family's estate in Cheshire near Manchester in the north of England.<ref>Parker, Peter. Isherwood, 2004, Picador, p. 6.</ref> He was the elder son of Francis Edward Bradshaw Isherwood (1869–1915), known as Frank, a professional soldier in the York and Lancaster Regiment, and Kathleen Bradshaw Isherwood, nee Machell Smith (1868–1960), the only daughter of a successful wine merchant.<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, Kathleen and Frank, 2013, Vintage, p. 3.</ref> He was the grandson of John Henry Isherwood, squire of Marple Hall and Wyberslegh Hall, Cheshire, and he included among his ancestors the Puritan judge John Bradshaw, who signed the death warrant of King Charles I.<ref> Isherwood, Christopher, Kathleen and Frank, 2013, Vintage, pp. 306, 309.</ref> Isherwood's father Frank was educated at the University of Cambridge and Sandhurst Military Academy, fought in the Boer War, and was killed in the First World War;<ref> Isherwood, Christopher, Kathleen and Frank, 2013, Vintage, p. 471.</ref> his mother Kathleen was a member through her mother of the wealthy Greene brewing family of Greene King, and Isherwood was a cousin of the novelist Graham Greene.<ref>Parker, Peter. Isherwood, 2004, Picador, p. 54.</ref> Frank and Kathleen christened their first son Christopher William Bradshaw Isherwood, which Isherwood streamlined on becoming a United States citizen in 1946.<ref> Isherwood, Christopher, Lost Years, 2001, Vintage, p. 78.</ref>
At Repton, his boarding school in Derbyshire, Isherwood met his lifelong friend Edward Upward, with whom he invented an imaginary English village, as related in his fictional autobiography, Lions and Shadows (1938).<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, Lions and Shadows, 2013, Vintage, p. 71-82.</ref> He went up to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, as a history scholar, wrote jokes and limericks on his second year Tripos and was asked to leave without a degree in 1925.
At Christmas 1925, he was reintroduced to a prep school friend, W. H. Auden. Through Auden, Isherwood met the younger poet, Stephen Spender, who printed Auden's first collection, Poems (1928).<ref>Sutherland, John, Stephen Spender: A Literary Life, 2004, Oxford University Press, p. 84.</ref> Upward, Isherwood, Auden, and Spender were identified as the most exciting new literary group in England in the 1930s. Auden dubbed Isherwood the novelist in what came to be known as the Auden Group or Auden Generation.<ref>Spender, Stephen, World Within World, 1966, University of California Press, p. 101</ref> With Cecil Day-Lewis and Louis MacNeice, Auden and Spender later attracted the name the MacSpaunday Poets, with which Isherwood is also associated.
After leaving Cambridge, Isherwood worked as a private tutor and later as secretary to a string quartet led by the violinist André Mangeot while he completed his first novel. This was All the Conspirators, published in 1928, about the struggle for self-determination between children and their parents. In October 1928, Isherwood enrolled as a medical student at King's College London, but he left after six months.<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, Lions and Shadows, 2013, Vintage, p. 235.</ref>
In March 1929, Isherwood joined Auden in Berlin, where Auden was spending a post-graduate year. The ten-day visit changed Isherwood's life, beginning his liberation as a homosexual. He began an affair with a German boy met at a cellar bar called The Cosy Corner,<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, Christopher and His Kind, 2012, Vintage, p. 3-4.</ref> and he was "brought face to face with his tribe"<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, Christopher and His Kind, 2012, Vintage, p. 16.</ref> at Magnus Hirschfeld's Institute for Sexual Science.<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, Christopher and His Kind, 2012, Vintage, p. 16. See also Auden's 1929 Berlin Journal which makes clear that he and Isherwood visited Hirschfeld together and went around the museum in March / April.</ref> He visited Berlin again in July, and moved there in November.<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, Christopher and His Kind, 2012, Vintage, p. 12.</ref>
=== Sojourn in Berlin ===
In Berlin, Isherwood completed his second novel, The Memorial (1932), about the impact of the First World War on his family and his generation. He also continued his habit of keeping a diary. In his diary, he gathered raw material for Mr. Norris Changes Trains (1935), inspired by his real-life friendship with Gerald Hamilton,<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, Christopher and His Kind, 2012, Vintage, p. 76.</ref> and for Goodbye to Berlin (1939), his portrait of the city in which Adolf Hitler was rising to power—enabled by poverty, unemployment, increasing attacks on Jews and Communists, and ignored by the defiant hedonism of night life in the cafés, bars, and brothels. Goodbye to Berlin included stories published in the leftist magazine, New Writing, and it included Isherwood's 1937 novella Sally Bowles, in which he created his most famous character, based on a young Englishwoman, Jean Ross,<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, Christopher and His Kind, 2012, Vintage, p. 61.</ref> with whom he briefly shared a flat.
In America, the Berlin novels were published together as The Berlin Stories in 1945.<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, Diaries: Volume One: 1939-1960, 2011, Vintage, p. 910.</ref> In 1951, Goodbye to Berlin was adapted for the New York stage by John van Druten using the title I Am a Camera, taken from Isherwood's opening paragraphs.<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, Diaries: Volume One: 1939-1960, 2011, Vintage, p. 912.</ref> The play inspired the hit Broadway musical Cabaret (1966), later adapted to film as Cabaret in 1972. 
In 1932, Isherwood started a relationship with a young German, Heinz Neddermeyer.<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, Christopher and His Kind, 2012, Vintage, p. 92-94.</ref> They fled Nazi Germany together in May 1933, traveling initially to Greece. Neddermeyer was refused entry to England in January 1934,<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, Christopher and His Kind, 2012, Vintage, p. 164-166.</ref> launching an odyssey in search of a sexual homeland where they could settle together. They lived in the Canary Islands, Copenhagen, Brussels, Amsterdam, and Sintra, Portugal, while trying to obtain a new nationality and passport for Neddermeyer. In May 1937, Neddermeyer was arrested by the Gestapo for draft evasion and reciprocal onanism.<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, Christopher and His Kind, 2012, Vintage, p. 296.</ref>
During this period, Isherwood returned often to London where he took his first movie-writing job, working with Vienna director Berthold Viertel on the film Little Friend (1934).<ref>Parker, Peter. Isherwood, 2004, Picador, p. 271.</ref> He collaborated with Auden on three plays – The Dog Beneath the Skin (1935), The Ascent of F6 (1936), and On the Frontier (1938) – all produced by Robert Medley and Rupert Doone's Group Theatre. He also worked on Lions and Shadows (1938), a fictionalized autobiography of his education — both in and out of school — in the 1920s.
In January 1938, Isherwood and Auden traveled to China to write Journey to a War (1939) about the Sino-Japanese conflict.<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, Christopher and His Kind, 2012, Vintage, pp. 304, 310.</ref> They returned to England the following summer via the United States and decided to emigrate there in January 1939.<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, Christopher and His Kind, 2012, Vintage, p. 326.</ref>
=== Life in the United States ===
While living in Hollywood, California, Isherwood befriended Truman Capote, an up-and-coming young writer who would be influenced by Isherwood's Berlin Stories, most specifically in the traces of the story "Sally Bowles" that surface in Capote's famed novella Breakfast at Tiffany's.<ref></ref>
Isherwood also befriended Dodie Smith, a British novelist and playwright who had also moved to California, and who became one of the few people to whom Isherwood showed his work in progress.<ref name="test"> urltoken "Smith &#91;married name Beesley&#93;, Dorothy Gladys &#91;Dodie&#93; (1896–1990)", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 3 March 2014</ref>
Isherwood considered becoming an American citizen in 1945 but balked at taking an oath that included the statement that he would defend the country. The next year he applied for citizenship and answered questions honestly, saying he would accept non-combatant duties like loading ships with food. The fact that he had volunteered for service with the Medical Corps also helped. At the naturalisation ceremony, he found he was required to swear to defend the nation and decided to take the oath since he had already stated his objections and reservations. He became an American citizen on 8 November 1946.<ref>Bucknell (ed.), pp.40, 77–8</ref>
He began living with the photographer William "Bill" Caskey. In 1947, the two traveled to South America. Isherwood wrote the prose and Caskey took the photographs for a 1949 book about their journey entitled The Condor and the Cows.
On Valentine's Day 1953, at the age of 48, he met the teenager Don Bachardy among a group of friends on the beach at Santa Monica. Reports of Bachardy's age at the time vary, but Bachardy later said, "At the time I was probably 16."<ref>The biographical film Chris & Don: A Love Story</ref> In fact, he was 18.<ref>Bachardy was born in May 1934, meaning that in February 1953 he was 18</ref> Despite the age difference, this meeting began a partnership that, though interrupted by affairs and separations, continued until the end of Isherwood's life.<ref>Peter Parker, Isherwood, 2004</ref>
During the early months of their affair, Isherwood finished—and Bachardy typed—the novel on which he had worked for some years, The World in the Evening (1954). Isherwood also taught a course on modern English literature at Los Angeles State College (now California State University, Los Angeles) for several years during the 1950s and early 1960s.
The 30-year age difference between Isherwood and Bachardy raised eyebrows at the time, with Bachardy, in his own words, "regarded as a sort of child prostitute,"<ref> urltoken "The First Couple: Don Bachardy and Christopher Isherwood", by Armistead Maupin, The Village Voice, Volume 30, Number 16, 2 July 1985.</ref> but the two became a well-known and well-established couple in Southern Californian society with many Hollywood friends.

Down There on a Visit, a novel published in 1962, comprised four related stories that overlap the period covered in his Berlin stories. In the opinion of many reviewers, Isherwood's finest achievement was his 1964 novel A Single Man, that depicted a day in the life of George, a middle-aged, gay Englishman who is a professor at a Los Angeles university.<ref></ref> The novel was adapted into the film, A Single Man, in 2009. During 1964 Isherwood collaborated with American writer Terry Southern on the screenplay for the Tony Richardson film adaptation of The Loved One, Evelyn Waugh's caustic satire on the American funeral industry.
Isherwood and Bachardy lived together in Santa Monica for the rest of Isherwood's life. Isherwood was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1981, and died of the disease on 4 January 1986 at his Santa Monica home, aged 81. His body was donated to medical science at UCLA, and his ashes were later scattered at sea.<ref>Wilson, Scott.

Kindle Edition.</ref> Bachardy became a successful artist with an independent reputation, and his portraits of the dying Isherwood became well known after Isherwood's death.<ref>Bachardy, Don, Christopher Isherwood: Last Drawings, Faber and Faber: 1990, </ref>
=== Association with Vedanta ===
Gerald Heard had introduced British writer Aldous Huxley to Vedanta (Hindu-centered philosophy) and meditation. After migrating to America in 1937,<ref>Aldous Huxley: A Biography, Dana Sawyer, 2002, page 101</ref> Heard and Huxley became Vedantists attending functions at the Vedanta Society of Southern California, under the guidance of founder Swami Prabhavananda, a monk of the Ramakrishna Order of India. Both were initiated by the Swami.<ref>Aldous Huxley: A Biography, Dana Sawyer, 2002, page 111</ref> Isherwood had a close friendship with Huxley, with whom he sometimes collaborated. Huxley introduced Isherwood to the Swami's Vedanta Society.<ref></ref> Isherwood became a dedicated Vedantist himself and was initiated by Prabhavananda, his guru.<ref name="ReferenceB">My Guru and His Disciple, Isherwood</ref>
The process of conversion to Vedanta was so intense that Isherwood was unable to write another novel between the years 1939–1945, while he immersed himself in study of the Vedanta Scriptures, even becoming a monk for a time at the Society.<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref name="Izzo"></ref> For the next 35 years Isherwood collaborated with the Swami on translations of various Vedanta scriptures, including the Bhagavad Gita, writing articles for the Society's journal, and occasionally lecturing at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara temples. For many years he would come to the Hollywood temple on Wednesday nights to read the Gospel of Ramakrishna for a half an hour, then the Swami would take questions from the devotees.<ref name="Hinduism Today"></ref>
From 1950 to 1978, Isherwood gave 53 lectures at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara Vedanta Temples. He mentions in his diaries and the book, My Guru and His Disciple, that he feels unqualified to preach, so most of his lectures were readings of papers written by others, primarily Swami Vivekananda. There were a few original lectures including, Who Is Ramakrishna, The Writer and Vedanta, and a lecture on Girish Chandra Ghosh, a householder disciple of Ramakrishna.<ref> As listed in the monthly bulletins of the Vedanta Society of Southern California</ref>
Isherwood was also very involved in the production of the bi-monthly journal of the Vedanta Society of Southern California, Vedanta and the West. From 1943 to 1945 he was Managing Editor, from 1951 to 1962 he was an Editorial Advisor together with Aldous Huxley, Gerald Heard, and additionally with John van Druten from 1951 to 1958. From 1949 to 1969 he wrote 40 articles for the Journal.<ref>Vedanta and the West publication history</ref>
