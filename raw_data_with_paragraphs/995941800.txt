Pallas's leaf warbler

== Description ==
Pallas's leaf warbler is one of the smallest warblers, with a large head and short tail.<ref name="Svensson"/> At long and in weight, it is slightly smaller than a yellow-browed warbler and barely any larger than a goldcrest. It has greenish upperparts and white underparts, but is very striking, with prominent pale yellow double wingbars on the wing covert feathers, bold yellow supercilia and central crown stripe, and a lemon-yellow rump.<ref name="Svensson"></ref><ref name="Hoyo"/> The bill is blackish-brown with a yellowish tinge to the cutting edges and the base of the lower mandible, the iris is brown, and the legs are brown with a green or greyish tinge.<ref name="bakerpallas"/> Although the yellow rump is obvious when a bird is low in vegetation or hovering, it can otherwise be hard to see.<ref name="Svensson"/>
In Asia, Pallas's leaf warbler can be distinguished from its former subspecies by its yellower head stripes, wingbars and throat as well as its different vocalisations.<ref name="Hoyo"/> Other yellow-rumped Asiatic warblers resemble Pallas's; buff-barred and Brooks's leaf warblers are larger, much duller green above and less strongly marked, and their wing bars are buff and white respectively, not yellow. Ashy-throated warbler has grey head markings, face and throat, and pale yellow underparts.<ref name="bakerpallas"/>
The sexes of Pallas's leaf warbler have similar plumage, but non-breeding birds are somewhat brighter green above and have broad, bright fringes to their flight feathers. Juveniles are like the adults, but have a brown tinge to the upperparts, greyish-white underparts and a duller supercilium. Adults have a complete post-breeding moult in August or September before migrating south. Juveniles and pre-breeding adults have a partial moult in March or April, replacing all the body plumage and some tail feathers.<ref name="bakerpallas">Baker (1997) pp. 283–285.</ref>
The song of Pallas's leaf warbler is delivered from a concealed perch near the top of a tall tree.<ref name="brazil"/> It is strong and prolonged, with a medley of whistles, or similar, with some phrases reminiscent of a canary, and interspersed trills. It lasts 2–4&nbsp;seconds and may be heard in the winter quarters as well as from breeding birds.<ref name="simms"></ref> The call is a short, soft .<ref name="bakerpallas"/> In contrast, the former subspecies have quite different songs, with sustained rattles for several seconds, or sometimes minutes. Their calls are typically sharp and monosyllabic.<ref name="hbwlemon"></ref><ref name="hbwyunnan"></ref>
== Distribution and habitat ==
Pallas's leaf warbler breeds in coniferous taiga forests including fir, spruce, pine and larch, or in mixed forest with rhododendron, karsu oak and a high percentage of conifers. In southern Russia, it was found breeding at up to . In winter, it uses a wider range of habitats, including broadleaf forest and scrub as well as conifers, and can be found in river valleys down to .<ref name="bakerpallas"/><ref name="Hoyo"/>
Pallas's leaf warbler breeds in Siberia from the Altai Mountains east to the Sea of Okhotsk, northern Mongolia, northeast China and possibly North Korea. It is strongly migratory and winters mainly in subtropical south China, northern Thailand and elsewhere in northeastern Indochina.<ref name="Hoyo"></ref> It is rare but annual in Japan.<ref name="brazil"></ref>
=== Other movements ===
Pallas's leaf warbler now occurs regularly in Europe in autumn. The first known European record was shot in 1829 in Dalmatia, now Croatia, but John Gould, who formally described it, did not realise the species had already been discovered in Asia, and named it as the "Dalmatian Regulus", Regulus modestus.<ref name="gould"></ref> German ornithologist Heinrich Gätke, who moved to the then-British island of Heligoland in 1837 and stayed there for some fifty years, subsequently showed that several Asiatic species, including an occasional Pallas's leaf warbler, were regularly found there in autumn.<ref name="seeb1"></ref><ref name="seeb2"></ref>
In the far west of Europe, the UK's first Pallas's leaf warbler was shot in 1896,<ref name="zoo"></ref> although it was not until 1951 that the second was found.<ref name="bb1952"></ref> Thereafter, this species became increasingly common, ceasing to be a national rarity at the end of 1990.<ref name="bb1992"></ref> In 2003, for example, 313 were recorded in Britain.<ref name="bb2006"></ref> Pallas's leaf warbler also occurs at least annually in Sweden, Finland and Denmark.<ref name="BWP"/>
Most Pallas's leaf warblers found in Europe are first-year birds,<ref name="BWP"></ref> and several reasons for the large increase in numbers in autumn have been proposed. In the past, these warblers were widely considered to be vagrants or reverse migrants, but were more recently thought to be undertaking a regular migration, taking advantage of the mild oceanic climate on the western fringes of Europe for overwintering.<ref name="gilroy"></ref> A flaw in that theory is that many birds should winter in Spain, particularly in the northwest, but Pallas's leaf warbler is rare in that country and tends to occur in the east. Spanish ornithologist Eduardo de Juana has therefore proposed that once the warblers reach northwest Europe, they then reorientate to a south easterly direction.<ref name="juana"></ref>
Outside Europe, Pallas's leaf warbler has been recorded as a vagrant in north Africa (Tunisia<ref name="IUCN"/> and Morocco), western Asia (Israel, Turkey and Iran), central Asia (Uzbekistan and Tajikistan), southeast Asia (Bangladesh and Taiwan), and Alaska.<ref name="Hoyo"/>
== Behaviour ==
Pallas's leaf warbler is not wary but its unobtrusive arboreal lifestyle makes it difficult to observe, particularly in thick foliage. It is constantly in motion, and often hovers briefly like a goldcrest, although more frequently,<ref name="simms"/> and may sometimes hang upside-down.<ref name="Svensson"/>
=== Breeding ===
Nesting is from June to July, with eggs laid from mid-June. The nest is built by the female in a conifer, usually next to the trunk at above ground, sometimes in a bush. It is a round or elliptical cup made from twigs, leaves and other vegetation and lined with finer material including feathers, hair or fine grasses.<ref name="Hoyo"/> Four to six blue-grey flecked white eggs are laid and incubated by the female.<ref name="Москва"/> They hatch after 12–13 days, with the chicks fledge when 12–14 days old. They are fed mainly by the female while in the nest, but by both parents for about a week after fledging. In the south of the range, a pair may sometimes raise a second brood. The breeding territory in central Siberia is usually , infrequently as much as .<ref name="Hoyo"/>
Pallas's leaf warbler, as with other members of its genus, is a host of the oriental cuckoo, a brood parasite.<ref name="cuckoo"></ref> The cuckoo's egg is similar in appearance, though larger, to those of the host species.<ref name="Москва"></ref>
=== Feeding ===
Like its relatives, Pallas's leaf warbler is insectivorous, feeding on the adults, larvae and pupa of small insects including fly, moths and aphids; spiders are also taken. Birds forage in bushes and trees, picking items from leaves or catching prey in short flights or while hovering. When not breeding, they may join mixed-species foraging flocks together with tits, goldcrests and other warblers.<ref name="Hoyo"/><ref name=simms/> In Asia, accompanying species may also include white-eyes, minivets and babblers.<ref name=Zhang></ref>
== Status ==
The Pallas's leaf warbler has a large range, and although global population trends have not been quantified, numbers are believed to be stable. This species does not approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (that is, declining more than 30 percent in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, it is evaluated as of "least concern" by the IUCN.<ref name="IUCN"/>
Pallas's leaf warbler is widespread, common and locally abundant in Russia and northeast China. Breeding densities of up to 35–50 pairs/km<sup>2</sup> (90–130 pairs/mi<sup>2</sup>) have been recorded in southeast Russia, with only slightly lower figures in Siberia. It is locally common in parts of its wintering grounds in southeast Asia.<ref name="Hoyo"/>

* Lemon-rumped warbler Phylloscopus chloronotus. Himalayas, southwest China. Three subspecies, P. c. chloronotus, P. c. forresti and P. c. simlaensis.
* Gansu leaf warbler Phylloscopus kansuensis. Central western China, monotypic.
* Chinese leaf warbler Phylloscopus yunnanensis (synonym P. sichuanensis). Western China, monotypic.
Of these, Phylloscopus chloronotus forresti is possibly also a separate species, but further analysis is required to confirm this. The breeding ranges of the Gansu leaf warbler and the Chinese leaf warbler overlap in southern Gansu, but the species are separated ecology: the Gansu leaf warbler is found in taller forest habitats and the Chinese leaf warbler uses lower, often scrubby habitats.<ref name="hbwonlinefam"/> "Lemon-rumped warbler" was sometimes used as synonym for Pallas's leaf warbler before the species' split.<ref name="bakerpallas"/> Pallas's leaf warbler appears to have diverged from the Chinese leaf warbler 4.1–5.5&nbsp;million years ago, and from its other former subspecies about 1.7–3.2&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name="martens"/>
