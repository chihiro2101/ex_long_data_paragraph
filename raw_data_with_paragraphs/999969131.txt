Isabel Luberza Oppenheimer

==Early years and youth==
Isabel Luberza Oppenheimer was born in the San Anton neighborhood of Ponce, Puerto Rico,<ref>José Ángel Cangiano. Receso del Tribunal: Vivencias Judiciales. Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic: Editoria Centenario. 2007, pg. 3.</ref> on 23 July 1901. Apart from her business as a madam, well documented in many Puerto Rican newspapers such as El Dia and El Vocero, not much is known about her early life. One widely circulated version is that Isabel left home as a young teenager to live with a wealthy man only to find out that he was married.<ref name="aparicio"/> Another version says she dated and married a much older man, a wealthy American.<ref> urltoken Se Resolvio el Caso de "Isabel la Negra"! 25 August 2006. Maria Elena Salinas. Univision.</ref> A well researched and documented story of her life is presented by the prominent<ref> urltoken Fortuño lamenta muerte de José Ángel “Chiro” Cangiano. Primera Hora. San Juan, Puerto Rico. 3 October 2011. Accessed 3 May 2018.</ref> criminal attorney and businessman José Ángel “Chiro” Cangiano. In his legal documentary "Receso del Tribunal: Vivencias Judiciales of Jose Angel Cangiano" ("Courtroom Recess: Judicial Experiences of Jose Angel Cangiano"), he debunks those stories and documents Isabel's true story: As a young girl of the poor lower class in Ponce, Isabel fell in love with the son of a wealthy upper class homeowner in the city where her mother worked as a housemaid. The elegant gentleman, a young attorney, returned her love in various ways, including purchasing her a home where he would later enjoy her cooking and would occasionally also invite his professional friends, including attorneys, judges, and prosecutors, for socializing with their wives. Their romance, however, ended abruptly when Isabel, walking downtown with her cousin Norma, recognized her wealthy boyfriend as the groom in the nuptial caravan that passed her during her boyfriend's unannounced marriage to another girl, also a member of Ponce's upper class. Emotionally affected by the experience and "in a bath of tears", Isabel told her cousin Norma that "the man that from that day hence wants to enter my house has to pay a charge." Thus developed the beginnings of Isabel as a brothel owner.<ref name="Jose Antonio Cangiano 2007. page 5">Jose Antonio Cangiano. "The People of Puerto Rico v. Isabel Luberza Oppenheimer."

==Business and career==
From the late 1930s to the mid-1960s, she owned and operated her bordello in the municipality of Ponce. At that time prostitution was tolerated in Puerto Rico. Her bordello was allegedly visited by politicians, businessmen, and clerics, although this remains unconfirmed.<ref name="aparicio">Frances R.

Dubbed by the public Isabel la Negra, she declared herself "Madame" of her brothel. Isabel had two brothels: one in San Anton and another one in Maraguez.<ref name="aparicio"/> Some sources claim that, while her brothel businesses made her quite wealthy, the Catholic Church did not accept her donations because of her past and the nature of her profession;<ref name="aparicio"/> but others state the she made many numerous well-received and significant contributions to the Catholic Church in Ponce.<ref name="Jose Antonio Cangiano 2007. page 5"/>
==Death==
Isabel la Negra was shot dead on 4 January 1974, an innocent bystander of a drug-related homicide which occurred near one of her establishments. She was 72 years old. She was buried at Cementerio Civil de Ponce.<ref name="aparicio"/> The Catholic Church, which she had allegedly supported for many years, refused to accept her body into the Ponce Cathedral as part of the ceremonies for her burial. In spite of, and some say as a consequence of, this over 13,000 people attended her funeral.<ref> urltoken Una vida llena de contrastes: Aunque no se ganó su sustento de la forma más encomiable, de alguna manera Isabel la Negra supo atrapar el corazón de muchos ponceños.
