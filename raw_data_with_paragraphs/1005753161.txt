Brandenburg-Prussia

===West African Gold Coast (Großfriedrichsburg)===
In 1679, Raule presented Frederick William a plan to establish colonies in African Guinea, and the elector approved.<ref name=Heyden12/> In July 1680, Frederick William issued respective orders, and two ships were selected to establish trade contacts with African tribes and explore places where colonies could be established.<ref name=Heyden14>van der Heyden (2001), p. 14</ref> On 17 September, frigate Wappen von Brandenburg ("Seal of Brandenburg") and Morian (poetic for "Mohr", "Negro") left for Guinea.<ref name=Heyden14/> The ships reached Guinea in January 1681.<ref name=Heyden14/> Since the crew of the Wappen von Brandenburg sold a barrel of brandy to Africans in a territory claimed by the Dutch West Indies Company, the latter confiscated the ship in March.<ref name=Heyden14/> The crew of the remaining ship Morian managed to have three Guinean chieftains sign a contract on 16 May, before the Dutch expelled the vessel from the coastal waters.<ref name=Heyden14/> This treaty, officially declared as trade agreement, included a clause of subjection of the chiefs to Frederick William's overlordship<ref name=Heyden14/> and an agreement allowing Brandenburg-Prussia to establish a fort,<ref name=Heyden15>van der Heyden (2001), p. 15</ref> and is thus regarded the beginning of the Brandenburg-Prussian colonial era.<ref name=Heyden14/>
To facilitate the colonial expeditions, the Brandenburg African Company was founded on 7 March 1682,<ref name=Heyden21>van der Heyden (2001), p. 21</ref> initially with its headquarters in Berlin and its shipyards in Pillau, since 1683 in Emden.<ref name=Heyden20>van der Heyden (2001), p. 20</ref> Throughout its existence, the company was underfunded, and expeditions were financed also by private capital, including payments by Raule and Frederick William.<ref name=Heyden21/> In July 1682, an expedition under East Prussian Otto Friedrich von der Groeben was sent to Guinea to erect the fortress Großfriedrichsburg.<ref name=Heyden23>van der Heyden (2001), p. 23</ref> On 24 February 1684, another treaty with indigenous chiefs was signed that allowed the erection of a second fort in nearby Accada (now Akwida),<ref name=Heyden31>van der Heyden (2001), p. 31</ref> named Dorotheenschanze after Frederick William's second wife.<ref name=Heyden32>van der Heyden (2001), p. 32</ref> On 4 February 1685, a treaty was signed with the chiefs of Taccararay (now Takoradi), some 30 kilometers east of Großfriedrichsburg.<ref name=Heyden32/> A fourth fort was built at a spring near the village of Taccrama, between Großfriedrichsburg and Dorotheenschanze, named Loge or Sophie-Louise-Schanze.<ref name=Heyden32/> Overall, the colony comprised roughly 50 kilometers of coastline, and did not extend into the hinterland.<ref name=Heyden34>van der Heyden (2001), p. 34</ref>
===Arguin===
A second colony was established at the Arguin archipelago off the West African coast (now part of Mauritania). In contrast to the Guinean colony, Arguin had been a colony before: In 1520, Portugal had built a fort on the main island, which with all of Portugal came under Spain control in 1580.<ref name=Heyden39>van der Heyden (2001), p. 39</ref> In 1638 it was conquered by the Dutch Republic, and in 1678 by France, who due to high maintenance costs abandoned it and demolished the fort soon after.<ref name=Heyden39/> On 27 July 1685, an expedition was mounted by Frederick William and Raule, who took possession of the vacated colony on 1 October.<ref name=Heyden39/> Subsequently, the fort was rebuilt and contacts to the indigenous population established.<ref name=Heyden40>van der Heyden (2001), p. 40</ref> France was alarmed and sent a vessel to re-conquer the fort in late 1687,<ref name=Heyden40/> but the attack of a French frigate and a smaller vessel was beaten back by the Brandenburg-Prussian garrison.<ref name=Heyden41>van der Heyden (2001), p. 41</ref> The victory improved the relations to the indigenous people, many of whom were carried off as slaves by the French before.<ref name=Heyden41/> While Arguin did not reach the economic importance of Großfriedrichsburg, it temporarily advanced to the world's primary staple port for slaves.<ref name=Heyden42>van der Heyden (2001), p. 42</ref>
===Caribbean===
The African colonies enabled Brandenburg-Prussia to participate in the Triangular trade, yet it lacked its own trading post in the Caribbean Sea. In 1684, Brandenburg-Prussia was denied the purchase of the French islands Sainte Croix and Saint Vincent.<ref name=Carreras15>Carreras & Maihold (2004), p. 15</ref> In November 1685,<ref name=Carreras16>Carreras & Maihold (2004), p. 16</ref> after a failed attempt to purchase Saint Thomas from Denmark–Norway,<ref name=Carreras15/> a Brandenburg-Danish agreement was reached that allowed the Brandenburg African Company to rent part of Saint Thomas as a base for 30 years, while the sovereignty remained with Denmark and administration with the Danish West Indies and Guinean Company.<ref name=Carreras16/> The first Brandenburgian vessel arrived in 1686 with 450 Slaves from Großfriedrichsburg.<ref name=Carreras16/> Brandenburg-Prussia was allotted an area near the capital city Charlotte Amalie, called Brandenburgery, and other territories named Krum Bay and Bordeaux Estates further west.<ref name=Carreras16/> In 1688, 300 Europeans and several hundred slaves lived on the Brandenburgian estates.<ref name=Carreras17>Carreras & Maihold (2004), p. 17</ref> In November 1695, French forces looted the Brandenburgian (not the Danish) colony.<ref name=Carreras21>Carreras & Maihold (2004), p. 21</ref> In 1731, the Brandenburg-Prussian company on Saint Thomas (BAAC) became insolvent, and abandoned the island in 1735.<ref name=Carreras23>Carreras & Maihold (2004), p. 23</ref> Their last remains were sold by auction in 1738.<ref name=Carreras23/>
Brandenburg-Prussia tried to claim Crab Island in 1687, but the island was also claimed by other European powers beforehand, and when a second expedition in 1692 found the island under Danish control, the plan was abandoned.<ref name=Carreras2122>Carreras & Maihold (2004), pp. 21–22</ref> In 1689, Brandenburg-Prussia claimed Peter Island, but the small rock proved unsuitable for trade or settlement.<ref name=Carreras22>Carreras & Maihold (2004), p. 22</ref> In 1691, Brandenburg-Prussia and the Duchy of Courland agreed on a partition of Tobago, but since Courland later abandoned the territory and thus was no longer present on the island, the agreement was nullified, and negotiations with the English government which had interests in Tobago did not result in an agreement.<ref name=Carreras22/> In 1695, Brandenburg-Prussia attempted to acquire Tortola from England via diplomacy, but the negotiations went nowhere, and were eventually called off.<ref name=Carreras22/> Likewise, England declined an offer to purchase Sint Eustatius in 1697.<ref name=Carreras22/>

In 1675, after the Battle of Fehrbellin and the Brandenburg-Prussian advance in Swedish Pomerania during the Scanian War, Frederick William decided to establish a navy.<ref name=Heyden11/> He engaged Dutch merchant and shipowner Benjamin Raule as his advisor, who after a first personal meeting with Frederick William in 1675 settled in Brandenburg in 1676<ref name=Heyden11/> and became the major figure of Brandenburg-Prussia's emerging naval and colonial enterprise. The Brandenburg-Prussian navy was established from ten ships which Frederick William leased from Raule, and achieved first successes in the war against Sweden supporting the siege of Stralsund and Stettin and the invasion of Rügen.<ref name=Heyden12>van der Heyden (2001), p. 12</ref> In Pillau (now Baltiysk) on the East Prussian coast, Raule established shipyards and enlarged the port facilities.<ref name=Heyden11/>
After the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679), the navy was used to hijack Swedish ships in the Baltic Sea, and in 1680, six Brandenburg-Prussian vessels captured the Spain vessel Carolus Secundus near Oostende to pressure Spain to pay promised subsidies.<ref name=Heyden12/> The Spanish ship was renamed Markgraf von Brandenburg ("Margrave of Brandenburg") and became the flagship of an Atlantic fleet that was ordered to capture Spanish vessels carrying silver; it was not successful in this mission.<ref name=Heyden12/> In the following years, the navy was expanded, and the policy of leasing ships was replaced by the policy of building or purchasing them.<ref name=Heyden17>van der Heyden (2001), p. 17</ref> On 1 October 1684 Frederick William bought all ships that had been leased for 110,000 talers.<ref name=Heyden17/> Also in 1684, the East Frisian port of Emden replaced Pillau as the main Brandenburg-Prussian naval base.<ref name=Heyden35>van der Heyden (2001), p. 35</ref> From Pillau, part of the shipyard, the admiral's house and the wooden church of the employees was transferred to Emden.<ref name=Heyden35/> While Emden was not part of Brandenburg-Prussia, the elector owned a nearby castle, Greetsiel, and negotiated an agreement with the town to maintain a garrison and a port.<ref name=Heyden35/>
