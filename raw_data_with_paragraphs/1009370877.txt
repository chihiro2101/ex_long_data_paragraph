He grew up in West Philadelphia's Wynnefield neighborhood,<ref name="Schuman"/> and was raised Baptist.<ref></ref> He has an elder sister named Pamela and two younger siblings, twins Harry and Ellen.<ref name="Schuman"></ref> Smith attended Our Lady of Lourdes, a private Catholic elementary school in Philadelphia.<ref name="Iannucci"></ref> His parents separated when he was 13,<ref name="Keegan"></ref> but did not actually divorce until around 2000.<ref name="itas"></ref>
Smith attended Overbrook High School.<ref name="Iannucci"/> While it has been widely reported that Smith turned down a scholarship to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he never applied to college because he "wanted to rap."<ref></ref> Smith says he was admitted to a "pre-engineering summer program" at MIT for high school students, but he did not attend.<ref name="itas"/><ref></ref><ref></ref> According to Smith, "My mother, who worked for the School Board of Philadelphia, had a friend who was the admissions officer at MIT. I had pretty high SAT scores and they needed black kids, so I probably could have gotten in. But I had no intention of going to college."<ref></ref>
==Career==
===1985–1992: The Fresh Prince===
Smith started as the MC of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, with his childhood friend DJ Jazzy Jeff as turntablist and producer.<ref name=tca>Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2002</ref> Townes and Smith were introduced to each other by chance in 1985, as Townes was performing at a house party only a few doors down from Smith's residence, and he was missing his hype man. Smith decided to fill in. They both felt strong chemistry, and Townes was upset when his hype man finally made it to the party.<ref></ref>
Soon after, the two decided to join forces. Smith enlisted a friend to join as the beatboxer of the group, Clarence Holmes (Ready Rock C), making them a trio. Philadelphia-based Word Up Records released their first single in late 1985 to 1986 when A&R man Paul Oakenfold<ref> urltoken Paul Oakenfold </ref> introduced them to Word Up with their single "Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble," a tale of funny misadventures that landed Smith and his former DJ and rap partner Mark Forrest (Lord Supreme) in trouble.<ref></ref> The song sampled the theme song of "I Dream of Jeannie." Smith became known for light-hearted story-telling raps and capable, though profanity-free, "battle" rhymes. The single became a hit a month before Smith graduated from high school.<ref name=sickening></ref>
Based on this success, the duo were brought to the attention of Jive Records and Russell Simmons. The duo's first album, Rock the House, which was first released on Word Up in 1986 debuted on Jive in March 1987. The group received the first Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance in 1989 for "Parents Just Don't Understand" (1988), though their most successful single was "Summertime" (1991), which earned the group their second Grammy and peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Smith and Townes are still friends and claim that they never split up, having made songs under Smith's solo performer credit.<ref></ref>
Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes.<ref name=tca/> The Internal Revenue Service eventually assessed a $2.8&nbsp;million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, and garnished his income.<ref></ref> Smith was struggling financially in 1990 when the NBC television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, around him.<ref name=tca/> The show was successful and began his acting career. Smith set for himself the goal of becoming "the biggest movie star in the world", studying box office successes' common characteristics.<ref name="Keegan" />
