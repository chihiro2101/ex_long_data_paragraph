Stepin Fetchit

== Music composition ==
In late November 1963, Perry collaborated with Motown founder Berry Gordy and Esther Gordy Edwards in composing "May What He Lived for Live," a song intended to honor the memory of John F. Kennedy in the wake of his assassination. Perry was credited under the pseudonym W.A. Bisson. The song was recorded in December 1963 by Liz Lands, who in 1968 performed the work at the funeral of the Martin Luther King Jr.<ref></ref>
==Awards and honors==
Fetchit has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
In 1976, despite popular aversion to his character, the Hollywood chapter of the NAACP awarded Perry a special NAACP Image Award. Two years later, he was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame.
==Legacy==
Perry spawned imitators, such as Willie Best ("Sleep 'n Eat") and Mantan Moreland, the scared, wide-eyed manservant of Charlie Chan. (Perry actually played a manservant in the Chan series before Moreland, in 1935's Charlie Chan in Egypt.<ref></ref>)
Perry appeared in one 1930 Our Gang short subject, A Tough Winter, at the end of the 1929–30 season. Perry signed a contract to star with the gang in nine films for the 1930-31 season and be part of the Our Gang series, but for some unknown reason, the contract fell through, and the gang continued without Perry. Previous to Perry entering films, the Our Gang shorts had employed several Black child actors, including Allen Hoskins, Jannie Hoskins, Ernie Morrison, and Eugene Jackson. In the sound Our Gang era black actors Matthew Beard and Billie Thomas were featured. The Black performers' personas in Our Gang shorts were the polar opposites of Perry's persona.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
Gordon Lightfoot referenced Stepin Fetchit in his 1970 song "Minstrel of the Dawn" on the album Sit Down Young Stranger.
In the 2005 book Stepin Fetchit: The Life and Times of Lincoln Perry,<ref></ref><ref></ref> African-American critic Mel Watkins<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> argued that the character of Stepin Fetchit was not truly lazy or simple-minded,<ref></ref> but instead a prankster who deliberately tricked his White employers so that they would do the work instead of him. This technique, which developed during American slavery, was referred to as "putting on old massa", and it was a kind of con art with which Black audiences of the time would have been familiar.<ref name="npr" /><ref></ref><ref></ref>
==Personal life==
In 1929, Perry married 17-year-old Dorothy Stevenson. She gave birth to their son, Jemajo, on September 12, 1930.<ref name=Shuffling /> In 1931, Dorothy filed for divorce, stating that Perry had broken her nose, jaw, and arm with "his fists and a broomstick."<ref name=":0"></ref> A few weeks after their divorce was granted, Dorothy told a reporter she hoped someone would "just beat the devil out of him," as he had done to her.<ref name=":0" /> When Dorothy contracted tuberculosis in 1933, Perry moved her to Arizona for treatment. She died in September 1934.<ref name=":0" />
Perry reportedly married Winifred Johnson in 1937, but no record of their union has been found.<ref name=":1"></ref> On May 21, 1938, Winifred gave birth to a son she named Donald Martin Perry.<ref>Clark, Champ (2005). Shuffling to Ignominy: The Tragedy of Stepin Fetchit. iUniverse. p. 60. .</ref> Their relationship ended soon after Donald's birth. According to Winifred's brother Stretch Johnson, their father intervened after Perry knocked Winifred down the stairs and broke her nose.<ref name=":0" /> In 1941, Perry was arrested after Winifred filed a suit for child support. When he was released from jail, he told reporters, "Winnie and I were never married. It was all a publicity stunt. I want you and everybody else to know that that is not my baby. Winnie knows the baby isn't mine but she's trying to be smart."<ref name=":1" /> Winifred admitted that they were not legally married, but she insisted Perry was her son's father. The court ruled in her favor and ordered Perry to pay $12 a week (almost $220 in 2020 dollars) for the child's support. Donald later took his stepfather's surname, Lambright.
Perry married Bernice Sims on October 15, 1951. Although they separated by the mid-1950s, they remained married for the rest of their lives. Bernice died on January 9, 1985.<ref name=":0" />
On April 5, 1969, Donald Lambright traveled the Pennsylvania Turnpike shooting people. Reportedly, he injured 16 and killed four, including his wife, with an M1 carbine and a .30-caliber Marlin 336 carbine before turning one of the rifles on himself.<ref> urltoken Angry Young Man, The New York Times (April 6, 1969).</ref><ref> urltoken Pike killer felt violence only racial answer, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (April 7, 1969).</ref><ref> urltoken Pike killer not on drugs, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (April 10, 1969).</ref> The 1969 Pennsylvania Turnpike shooting was ruled a murder-suicide, but the account of the circumstances upon which the ruling was based was questioned by Lambright's daughter and discussed at length in her 2005 self-published book about Stepin Fetchit. In a Los Angeles Times interview, Lincoln Perry stated his belief that his son was set up. Lambright's involvement with the Black Power movement at the peak of the COINTELPRO program was believed to be related to his death. Perry never provided child support for Lambright, and they only met two years before his son's violent death.<ref name=":2"></ref>
==Death==
Perry suffered a stroke in 1976,<ref name="Lamparski" /> ending his acting career; he then moved into the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital.<ref name="Lamparski" /> He died on November 19, 1985, from pneumonia and heart failure at the age of 83.<ref></ref> He was buried at Calvary Cemetery in East Los Angeles with a Catholic funeral Mass.<ref name="The Los Angeles Times"></ref>
