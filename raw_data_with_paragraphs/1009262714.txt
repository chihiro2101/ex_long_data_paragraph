The union is a democratic organisation run by its members via an elected student officer committee and student council. It is affiliated to the National Union of Students.
The UEA Student Union has over 200 sports clubs and societies ranging from men's and women's football clubs and cheerleading society to a Quidditch team.<ref></ref> The UEA Media Collective encompasses the student newspaper Concrete, UEA:TV (previously named Nexus UTV)<ref name="UEA TV"></ref> and the student radio station Livewire 1350AM.
