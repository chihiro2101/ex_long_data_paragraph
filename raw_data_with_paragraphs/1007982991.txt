Ted Koppel

==Early life and education==
Koppel, an only child, was born in Nelson, England. His parents were German Jews who had fled Germany after the rise of Adolf Hitler and Nazism.<ref name=Ehrlichman/> In Germany, Koppel's father had operated a tire-manufacturing company. To help the British economy, the Home Secretary invited him and his wife to move the factory to Lancashire, England, where, he was promised, they would be protected in the event of war.<ref name=Ehrlichman/> The factory moved in 1936, but when war broke out in Europe in 1939, Koppel's father was declared an enemy alien and imprisoned on the Isle of Man for a year and a half.<ref name=Ehrlichman/>
Koppel was born in 1940, shortly after his father was taken away. To provide for her infant son, his mother sold her personal jewelry and did menial work in London.<ref name=Ehrlichman/> After he was released from internment, Koppel's father was still not permitted to work in England, nor would he allow his wife to work. Following the end of the war, the family gained some money from their confiscated assets and decided to leave for the United States.<ref name=Ehrlichman/> While in England, Ted Koppel was a pupil at Abbotsholme School, in Derbyshire. In 1953, when he was 13, the family emigrated to the United States,<ref name=Ehrlichman>John Ehrlichman. "Why We Stay Up for Ted Koppel." Parade Magazine, September 27, 1987, pp. P18, 20-21.</ref> where his mother, Alice, became a singer and pianist, and his father, Edwin, opened a tire factory.<ref></ref> Koppel said: "They came here because they believed the opportunities for me would be better in America."<ref name=Ehrlichman/> Koppel's boyhood hero was radio broadcaster Edward R. Murrow, whose factual reports during the The Blitz inspired him to become a journalist.<ref name="Moritz">Moritz, Charles. editor, Current Biography Yearbook, 1984, The H. W. Wilson Co., N.Y. (1984) pp. 216-220</ref>
After attending the McBurney School, a private preparatory institution in New York,<ref>Dan Nimmo and chevelle Newsome. Political Commentators in the United States in the 20th Century. Greenwood Press, 1997, p. 151.</ref> Koppel attended Syracuse University, from which he graduated at age 20 with a Bachelor of Science degree. He was a member of the Alpha Chi chapter of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. His roommate recalls that Koppel "was incredibly focused and had a photographic memory. He remembers almost every conversation he ever had with anybody. And the man never needs sleep."<ref name=WashPost/>
Koppel then went to Stanford University, where he earned a Master of Arts degree in Mass communications research and political science.<ref name="ABC News"></ref> While at Stanford, he met his future wife, Grace Anne Dorney.<ref name=Ehrlichman/>
==Career==
===News correspondent===
Koppel had a brief stint as a teacher before being hired as a copyboy at The New York Times and as a writer at WMCA (AM) in New York. In June 1963, he became the youngest correspondent ever hired by ABC Radio News, working on the daily Flair Reports program. His coverage of the Kennedy assassination in 1963 with Charles Osgood, caused the national news audience to take notice.<ref name=Ehrlichman/> He was scheduled to do a short report, but a delay during the crisis forced him to ad-lib for an hour and a half.<ref name=Moritz/>
In 1964, he covered his first of many presidential nominating conventions. He also began covering the civil rights movement in Selma, Alabama. ABC officials were impressed by Koppel's ability to clarify issues using plain language.<ref name=Moritz/> In 1966, he became the ABC News correspondent for the Vietnam War, moving from radio broadcasting to national television.<ref name=Ehrlichman/> He accepted the assignment only after the network agreed to send his wife and their two children to Hong Kong so they could be nearby.<ref name=Ehrlichman/> Before going he took a course to learn the Vietnamese language.<ref name=Ehrlichman/>
He returned in 1968 to cover the campaign of Richard Nixon, before becoming Hong Kong bureau chief, and U.S. State Department correspondent where Koppel formed a friendship with Henry Kissinger.<ref name=Ehrlichman/> According to Nixon advisor John Ehrlichman, Koppel's friendship with Kissinger was partly due to their similar backgrounds, having Jewish refugee parents and emigrating to America in their youth.<ref name=Ehrlichman/>
Koppel was among those traveling to China with U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1972. He spoke about it with the USC US-China Institute in their "Assignment: China" documentary series about American media coverage of China.<ref></ref> Koppel likened the trip to a "journey to the dark side of the moon". By 1975, he was anchoring the ABC Evening News on Saturdays, and he continued to file reports for ABC Radio.<ref> urltoken "The Ted Koppel Collection". Syracuse University Library, Special Collections.</ref>
Koppel would often report on State Department foreign conferences, as when he traveled with Kissinger during his meetings in Egypt and Israel in 1975.<ref name=Ehrlichman/> He said about Kissinger: "I have a high regard for Henry. He has a first-class mind. A half hour with him gives me a better insight into a foreign policy question than hours with others."<ref name=Ehrlichman/>
In the mid-1970s, Koppel took a year off from his career, to stay home with his children so that his wife could complete her education at Georgetown Law School. Koppel's decision upset ABC News president Roone Arledge, who demoted Koppel from news anchor when he returned to the network.<ref name=WashPost>"The Real King of Late Night", The Washington Post, June 12, 1996</ref>
In April 1979, he was lead reporter for an eleven-segment series, "Second to None?", which focused on explaining the dangers of nuclear war. He did his own research and wanted to present "complex material to an audience that hasn't paid much attention in the past but must in the future . if there is to be a future".<ref name=Moritz/> For the series he received an Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award.<ref name=Moritz/>
===Nelson Mandela interview===
In 1990, Koppel interviewed Nelson Mandela in a US-style town hall meeting.<ref> urltoken Nelson Mandela destroys Ted Koppel Part 1</ref>
==Host of Nightline==
Koppel became known for his work as the host of a late night news program called Nightline. The program originated as a series of special reports about the 445-day-long Iran hostage crisis, during which Iranian militants held 52 Americans captive, beginning in early November 1979. At first, the program was called The Iran Crisis: America Held Hostage, and was hosted by Frank Reynolds. Koppel eventually joined Reynolds as co-anchor. In March 1980, the program evolved into Nightline, with Koppel as its host.<ref>"Ask the Globe". Boston Globe, April 28, 1988, p. 52.</ref> In 1990, ABC News ran a one-hour special called "The Best of Nightline with Ted Koppel".<ref> urltoken "The Best of Nightline with Ted Koppel", 1 hour</ref> Koppel spent twenty-five years anchoring the program, before leaving ABC (and leaving as host of Nightline) in late November 2005.<ref>Mark Jurkowitz. "Koppel to Leave Nightline and ABC News". Boston Globe, April 1, 2005, p. D5.</ref>
While hosting Nightline, Koppel also hosted a series of special programs called Viewpoint, beginning in 1981, which provided media criticism and analysis. The show was envisioned by ABC News Vice President George Watson as a way to address any media bias that viewers might believe that they encountered on the network. Broadcast before a live audience, it provided viewers with a chance to question how stories were reported or critique television news.<ref>Judy Flander. "Ted Koppel to Moderate 'Viewpoint.'" Chicago Tribune, August 12, 1982, Section 4, p. 11.</ref> Viewpoint was broadcast sporadically, from 1981 until 1997.
Some liberal groups suggested that Koppel was a conduit for the government's point of view and accused him of favoring conservatives when selecting guests.<ref>"Koppel Looks Back on a Decade of Nightline". Boston Globe, November 8, 1989, p. 80</ref> In the late 1980s, the progressive media criticism organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) claimed that policymakers and ex-officials dominated the Nightline guest list, with critics of foreign policy less visible. In 1987, Newsweek called him the "quintessential establishment journalist". Koppel responded that "We are governed by the president and his cabinet and their people. And they are the ones who are responsible for our foreign policy, and they are the ones I want to talk to".<ref name=SolomonN-FAIR-2801>Solomon, Norman. – urltoken "Ted Koppel: 'Natural Fit' at NPR News and Longtime Booster of Henry Kissinger". – Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR). – January 16, 2006</ref>
=== Controversy regarding Pol Pot Video ===
In 1997, Nate Thayer, a journalist writing for the Far Eastern Economic Review who later interviewed Pol Pot shortly before Pol Pot's death, claimed that Koppel and ABC News made a oral contract with Thayer for the exclusive North American rights to use video from a show trial of Pol Pot that Thayer and Asiaworks Television videographer David McKaige witnessed on Nightline, and that ABC purportedly violated that agreement by posting still photo captures from the video on its news website, effectively allowing them to be viewed anywhere in the world.<ref></ref>
=== Departure from Nightline ===
On November 22, 2005, Koppel stepped down from Nightline after 25 years with the program and left ABC after 42 years with the network. His final Nightline broadcast did not feature clips highlighting memorable interviews and famous moments from his tenure as host, as is typical when an anchor retires. Instead, the show replayed an episode of Nightline with Koppel's 1995 interviews with retired Brandeis University sociology professor Morrie Schwartz, who was dying of Lou Gehrig's disease.<ref></ref>

The four-part documentary, called The People's Republic of Capitalism, is an extensive look at the fast-changing country. It takes a look at the role of Chinese consumers in the growing yet communist economy.<ref></ref>
Koppel and Discovery Communications parted ways in November, 2008, terminating their contract six months early, prompting rumors that Koppel would be hired for NBC's Meet the Press. Koppel stated that he was not interested in the job.<ref name="reuters.com"/>
