Gwyneth Dunwoody

==Early and private life==
Dunwoody was born in Fulham, London, where her father was Labour parliamentary agent.<ref name=times /> She belonged to an experienced political dynasty: her father, Wales-born Morgan Phillips, was a former coalminer who served as General Secretary of the Labour Party between 1944 and 1962; her mother, Norah Phillips was a former member of London County Council who became a life peer in 1964 (allowing Dunwoody to be styled "The Honourable"), serving as a government whip in the House of Lords, and as Lord Lieutenant of Greater London from 1978 to 1986.<ref name=times /> Both of her grandmothers were suffragettes, and all four grandparents were Labour party loyalists.<ref name=times> urltoken The Times, 18 April 2008 </ref>
She attended the Fulham County Secondary School for Girls, now the Fulham Cross Girls School, and the Notre Dame Convent (a girls' grammar school) in Battersea. She left school aged 16, and became a journalist with a local newspaper in Fulham,<ref name=times /> covering births, marriages and deaths.<ref name=telegraph /> She joined the Labour Party in 1947, and spoke at the 1948 Labour party conference in Scarborough.<ref name=telegraph /> She worked as an actress in repertory and as a journalist in the Netherlands, learning fluent Dutch, before suffering a bout of tuberculosis.<ref name=telegraph></ref><ref></ref>
=== Married life ===
She married John Dunwoody in 1954, the same year he qualified as a doctor. Her husband became a general practitioner based in Totnes in Devon.<ref name="times" /> They had two sons and a daughter. Their daughter, Tamsin Dunwoody, was a member of the National Assembly for Wales for one term between 2003 and 2007 and from 2005 was Deputy Minister for Enterprise, Innovation and Networks in the Welsh Assembly Government.
Her husband stood as Labour candidate in the safe Conservative seat of Tiverton in 1959, and came close to winning Plymouth Sutton in 1964, losing by just 410 votes<ref name=times /> (David Owen would later hold for several years for Labour).
Meanwhile, Dunwoody was a councillor on Totnes Borough Council (now South Hams) from 1963 to 1966. Her husband was finally elected as Labour MP for Falmouth and Camborne in 1966 (she was elected at the same time in Exeter). He served as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Department of Health and Social Security from 1969 until 1970. A well-regarded orator at the Labour Party Conference, John Dunwoody was spoken of as a future leader of the Party but lost his seat in the 1970 general election and did not return to Parliament. They were divorced in 1975.<ref></ref>
== Parliamentary career ==
Dunwoody stood as the Labour Party candidate for the Exeter seat in the 1964 general election. She was elected as Member of Parliament for Exeter in 1966, emulating her husband in Falmouth and Camborne. Like her husband, she also served as a junior minister, as a Parliamentary Secretary at the Board of Trade, and also lost her seat at the 1970 general election.<ref name="times" />
From 1970 to 1975, she was Director of the Film Producers Association of Great Britain and Consultant to the Association of Independent Cinemas.<ref> urltoken 
She returned to the House of Commons after the February 1974 general election, becoming MP for the safe seat of Crewe, having received the sponsorship of the National Union of Railwaymen<ref name=independent> urltoken The Independent, 18 April 2008 </ref> (later part of RMT). Dunwoody was also a Member of the European Parliament between 1975 and 1979 (alongside John Prescott<ref name=independent />) at a time when MEPs were nominated by national parliaments &mdash; MEPs have been directly elected since 1979.
In 1983, Dunwoody stood for election as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, alongside Peter Shore, on a Eurosceptic platform<ref name=times /> (a position she consistently maintained throughout her career - she voted against the Maastricht Treaty seven times<ref name=times/>). The position was won by Roy Hattersley, and Dunwoody came last out of the four candidates with 1.3% of the Electoral college.
She did not return to ministerial office, but served as a front bench spokesman on, by turns, transport, health,<ref></ref> and foreign affairs during the 18 years of Labour opposition from 1979 to 1997.<ref name=times /> She also served on the Labour National Executive Committee for seven years, from 1981 to 1988, collaborating closely with Betty Boothroyd.<ref name=times /><ref name=telegraph /><ref name=guardian /> She resisted the Militant group in her constituency and later opposed all-women shortlists.
In 1983, boundary changes abolished the constituency of Crewe and created the constituency of Crewe and Nantwich, with many Conservative voters from Nantwich included in the new seat. She narrowly won the election in 1983 by 290 votes.<ref name=telegraph /> She remained MP at Crewe and Nantwich until her death in 2008, having benefited from a further redrawing of the boundaries in 1997 which increased her majority substantially.<ref name=guardian> urltoken The Guardian, 18 April 2008 </ref>
In 1998, she gained headlines around the world when she clashed with New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani urging the return of the original Winnie the Pooh dolls from Donnell Library Center to the British Museum after she said she "detected sadness" in their display behind bulletproof glass in the United States library.
In October 2000, she was one of several candidates for the speakership of the House of Commons. The election was won by Michael Martin MP.
As a member for a constituency with a strong connection with the railway industry, she had considerable expertise on transport matters, and was Chair of the House of Commons' Transport Committee from 1997 to 2008. In this role she was a credible, independent-minded critic of the government, and she and her committee discomfited witnesses from the rail and air transport industries. Her involvement in railways extended beyond parliamentary responsibilities, and in December 2007 she presented the coveted National Railway Heritage Award plaque to a Swanage Railway team of volunteers for the installation of a historic footbridge at Corfe Castle railway station.<ref>Swanage Railway urltoken Plaque installed at Corfe Castle station footbridge </ref>
An attempt by the government whips to remove her and Donald Anderson, Chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, from their positions after the 2001 general election led to a revolt by back-bench members of Parliament, which resulted in them both being reinstated.<ref name=times />
She was President of Labour Friends of Israel from 1988 to 1993,<ref name=telegraph /> and was a parliamentary consultant to the British Fur Federation.<ref name=times /> She was one of 13 Labour MPs to vote against a reduction of the age of consent for homosexual acts to 16.<ref name=times />
