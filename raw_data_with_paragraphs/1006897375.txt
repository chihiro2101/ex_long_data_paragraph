Zond 5

==Background==
Out of the first four circumlunar missions launched by the Soviet Union there was one partial success, Zond 4, and three failures. After 's mission in , a follow-up, Zond 1968A, was launched on . The launch failed when an erroneous abort command shut down the Proton rocket's second stage. The escape rocket fired and pulled the descent module to safety.<ref></ref><ref></ref> In July, Zond 1968B was being prepared for launch when the second-stage rocket exploded on the launchpad, killing three people, but leaving the Proton first-stage booster rocket and the spacecraft itself with only minor damage.<ref></ref>
The mission was originally planned to fly Astronaut around the Moon, but the failures of and led the Soviets to send an uncrewed mission instead, from fear of the negative propaganda of an unsuccessful crewed flight.<ref name=rsw />
== Payload ==
Two Russian tortoises (Agrionemys horsfieldii) were included in the biological payload, weighing each pre-flight. Soviet scientists chose tortoises since they were easy to tightly secure. There were also two tortoises used as control specimens and four more in a vivarium. Twelve days before launch, the two space-bound tortoises were secured in the vehicle and deprived of food and water; the control tortoises were similarly deprived. The food deprivation was a part of pathomorphological and Histology experiments. The biological payload also included fruit fly eggs, cells of wheat, barley, pea, pine, carrots and tomatoes, specimens of the wildflower species Tradescantia, three strains of the single-celled green algae Chlorella, and one strain of Lysogen.<ref name=atlantic /> The purpose of sending a variety of terrestrial lifeforms was to test the effect of cosmic radiation on them.<ref name=journalnews /> However, the test subjects were not analogous to humans, because the choice of life forms were all extremophiles with a substantially higher radioresistance.<ref> urltoken The Russian Academy of Sciences stated that a mannequin equipped with radiation sensors occupied the pilot's seat.<ref name=nssdc />

==Mission==
=== Launch and trajectory ===
 launched on at 9:42.10UTC, from Site 81 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The thrust of the third-stage rocket was terminated at , which was the start of a 251-second coast. , the upper-stage rocket, ignited and burned for 108 seconds, placing the spacecraft into a parking orbit of . Fifty-six minutes into the parking orbit the fired a final time for the trans-lunar injection.<ref name=rsw /> After this maneuver, the launch was announced to the world. Mission Control discovered a problem with 's attitude and traced the cause to a contaminated star tracker. Heat caused some of the interior coating to outgas, which delayed an attitude correction on the way to the Moon. The maneuver was performed from Earth using the Sun and the Earth as reference points.<ref name=rsw />
On , the spacecraft flew around the Moon, although it did not orbit it.<ref name=atlantic></ref> The closest distance was .<ref name=nssdc /> On the way back from the Moon, another star tracker failed. The spacecraft also erroneously switched off the guided reentry system. The Soviet government had deployed eight ships to the Indian Ocean prior to the launch, as a precaution in case the spacecraft could not reach Soviet territory; only three of them had rescue helicopters on board.<ref name=rsw />
=== Reentry and recovery ===
On , the reentry capsule entered the Earth's atmosphere. The primary landing zone was in Kazakhstan, but instead splashdown in the Indian Ocean and was recovered by the Soviet vessels Borovichy (Боровичи) and Vasiliy Golovnin (Василий Головнин).<ref>Oleg Pavlenko (Олег Павленко), urltoken Из истории Морского космического флота.

==Results and future plans==
High-quality photographs of the Earth, the first photos of their kind,<ref></ref> were taken at a distance of .<ref name=nssdc /> British astronomer Bernard Lovell, considered to be Britain's top space expert, said that the mission showed that the Soviets were ahead in the Space Race. The British Interplanetary Society believed that the USSR would be able to send cosmonauts around the Moon within a matter of months.<ref></ref>
In , sources in the U.S. claimed the mission was not as successful as the Soviets advertised. The mission had been intended to fly closer to the Moon, and its actual distance did not allow for useful lunar photography. They also said that the angle at which the spacecraft reentered the atmosphere was too steep for a cosmonaut to have survived. The sources indicated that the spacecraft landed in the Indian Ocean when the planned location was in Soviet territory, which was a factor in the recovery taking ten hours.<ref></ref>
The official Soviet news agency, TASS, announced in that the flight had carried living animals. The tortoises were dissected on after fasting for 39days. The flying tortoises, identified as and , had lost 10% of their body weight during the trip, but showed no loss of appetite. The control tortoises lost 5% of their weight. Comparison of analyses of blood from the space-travelling tortoises and the control specimens revealed no differences. Another analysis showed the flying tortoises had elevated iron and glycogen levels in their liver and that the flight also affected the internal structures of their spleens.<ref name=journalnews></ref> The authors concluded that the changes in the flight tortoises were primarily due to starvation, with the space travel having little effect. In , it was announced that the spacecraft was planned as a precursor to a crewed lunar spacecraft. The Soviets made this announcement a month before the planned Apollo 8 flight, in an attempt to show they were close to being able to carry out a crewed trip to the Moon.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
== Cosmonaut crew communications test/hoax ==
The Zond 5 caused a scare in the United States when on 19 September 1968, the voices of cosmonauts Valery Bykovsky, Vitaly Sevastyanov and Pavel Popovich were transmitted from the spacecraft and intercepted by Jodrell Bank Observatory and the CIA.<ref> urltoken The cosmonauts were apparently reading out telemetry data and computer readings, and even discussing making an attempt to land. At the height of the Cold War, there was a real concern that the Soviets might actually beat NASA to the Moon. Apollo 17 astronaut Eugene Cernan remarked that the incident had "shocked the hell out of us."<ref> urltoken 
Popovich would later recall: "When we realized we would never make it to the moon, we decided to engage in a little bit of hooliganism. We asked our engineers to link the on-the-probe receiver to the transmitter with a jumper wire. Moon flight missions were then controlled from a command centre in Yevpatoria, in the Crimea. When the probe was on its path round the Moon, I was at the center. So I took the mike and said: "The flight is proceeding according to normal; we’re approaching the surface." Seconds later my report – as if from outer space – was received on Earth, including by the Americans. The U.S. space advisor Frank Borman got a phone call from President Nixon actually Johnson, who asked: "Why is Popovich reporting from the moon?" My joke caused real turmoil. In about a month’s time. Frank came to the USSR, and I was instructed to meet him at the airport. Hardly had he walked out of his plane when he shook his fist at me and said: "Hey, you, space hooligan!"<ref> urltoken

Zond 5 was a spacecraft of the Soviet Zond program. In it became the second spaceship to travel to and circle the Moon, and the first to return safely to Earth. Zond 5 carried the first terrestrial organisms to the vicinity of the Moon, including two tortoises, fruit fly eggs, and plants.<ref></ref> The tortoises underwent biological changes during the flight, but it was concluded that the changes were primarily due to starvation and that they were little affected by space travel.
The Zond spacecraft was a version of the Soyuz 7K-L1 crewed lunar-flyby spacecraft. It was launched by a Proton-K carrier rocket with a Block D upper-stage to conduct scientific studies during its lunar flyby.
