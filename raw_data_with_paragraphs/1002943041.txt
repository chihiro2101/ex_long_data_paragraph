Fantagraphics

==History==
=== Founding ===
Fantagraphics was founded in 1976 by Gary Groth and Michael Catron in College Park, Maryland. The company took over an zine named The Nostalgia Journal, which it renamed The Comics Journal.<ref>". . . transforming it from an adzine into a magazine of news and criticism that just happened to carry advertisements." urltoken The Comics Journal Message Board :: View topic – The Comics Journal #32 (January 1977).</ref>
As comics journalist (and former Fantagraphics employee) Michael Dean writes, "the publisher has alternated between flourishing and nearly perishing over the years."<ref name=rescue /> Kim Thompson joined the company in 1977, using his inheritance to keep the company afloat.<ref name=rescue>Dean, Michael. urltoken "Comics Community Comes to Fantagraphics' Rescue,", The Comics Journal, Posted July 11, 2003.</ref> (He soon became a co-owner.)<ref>Spurgeon, Tom and Jacob Covey.

The company moved from Maryland to Stamford, Connecticut.<ref name="Matos">Matos, Michelangelo. urltoken "Saved by the Beagle," Seattle Arts (September 15, 2004).</ref>
Beginning in 1981 Fantagraphics (under its Redbeard imprint)<ref name=az7>Amazing Heroes #7, December 1981, p. 5 indicia</ref> published Amazing Heroes, a magazine which examined comics from a hobbyist's point of view,<ref>"'Everything Was in Season,'": Kim Thompson: "We decided to do a magazine that would cover the mainstream in a more fannish manner."</ref> as another income stream to supplement The Comics Journal.<ref>"'Everything Was in Season,'" The Comics Journal (DEC. 08, 2016): Kim Thompson: "If you want to look at it cynically, we set out to steal The Comic Reader<nowiki>'</nowiki>s cheese. Which we did."</ref> Amazing Heroes ran for 204 issues (plus a number of specials and annuals), folding with its July 1992 issue.<ref>"Newswatch: Amazing Heroes Folding," The Comics Journal #149 (March 1992), p. 22.</ref>
=== Comics publisher ===
Beginning in 1979, Fantagraphics began publishing comics, starting with Jay Disbrow's The Flames of Gyro.<ref name="GCD"></ref> They gained wider recognition in 1982 by publishing the Hernandez brothers' Love and Rockets,<ref></ref> and moved on to such critically acclaimed and award-winning series as Acme Novelty Library, Eightball, and Hate.
The company moved operations to Greater Los Angeles in 1984.<ref name="Matos" />
Catron acted as Fantagraphics' co-publisher until 1985 (also handling advertising and circulation for The Comics Journal from 1982 to 1985), when he left the company.<ref name="WhosWho"></ref>
=== The Kirby Award and the Harvey Award ===
From 1985 to 1987, Fantagraphics coordinated and presented (through their magazine Amazing Heroes) The Jack Kirby Award for achievement in comic books, voted on by comic-book professionals. The Kirby Award was managed by Dave Olbrich, a Fantagraphics employee (and later publisher of Malibu Comics). In 1987, a dispute arose when Olbrich and Fantagraphics each claimed ownership of the awards.<ref name=olbrich></ref> A compromise was reached, and starting in 1988, the Kirby Award was discontinued and two new awards were created:<ref>"Newswatch: Kirby Awards End In Controversy," The Comics Journal #122 (June 1988), pp. 19–20.</ref> the Eisner Award, managed by Olbrich; and the Fantagraphics-managed Harvey Award, named for cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman. Since their inception, the Harvey Awards have been presented at various comic book conventions, such as the Chicago Comicon, the Dallas Fantasy Fair, WonderCon, the Pittsburgh Comicon, the MoCCA Festival, Baltimore Comic-Con and their current venue, the New York Comic Con. The Harvey Awards are no longer affiliated with Fantagraphics.
=== Relocation to Seattle ===
In 1989, Fantagraphics relocated from Los Angeles to its current location in the Maple Leaf neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.<ref name="Matos" />
In 1990, the publisher introduced Eros Comix, a lucrative line of erotic comics which again saved the company from bankruptcy.<ref name=rescue />
Longtime employee Eric Reynolds joined Fantagraphics in 1993, first as news editor for The Comics Journal from 1993, before moving to marketing and promotion in 1996.<ref name="ComicsReporterInterview"></ref> Tom Spurgeon, later known as the publisher of The Comics Reporter, was editor of The Comics Journal from 1994 to 1999.<ref></ref>
=== Financial ups and downs ===
In 1998, Fantagraphics was forced into a round of layoffs;<ref name=rescue /> and in 2003 the company almost went out of business, losing over $60,000 in the wake of the 2002 bankruptcy of debtor and book trade distributor Seven Hills Distribution.<ref>Dean, Michael. urltoken "Seven Hills Follows LPC into Limbo, Marvel Abandons Diamond for CDS," The Comics Journal, Posted August 30, 2002.</ref> One employee quit during the subsequent layoff while denouncing Fantagraphics' "disorganization and poor management."<ref name=rescue /> Fantagraphics was saved by a restructuring and a successful appeal to comic book fandom that resulted in a huge number of orders.<ref name=rescue /> After restructuring, the company has had greater success with such hardcover collections as The Complete Peanuts, distributed by W. W. Norton & Company.<ref name="Matos" />
In 2009, Fantagraphics ceased publishing the print edition of The Comics Journal,<ref> urltoken The 300th and final magazine-sized issue of the Comics Journal The Comics Journal No. 300 free and online</ref> shifting from an eight-times a year publishing schedule to a larger, more elaborate, semi-annual format supported by a new website.<ref>Phegley, Kiel. urltoken "Rethinking 'The Comics Journal'", Comic Book Resources, October 30, 2009</ref><ref>Spurgeon, Tom. urltoken "TCJ Moves More Dramatically On-Line; Print Version To Come Out Two Times A Year", The Comics Reporter, October 27, 2009</ref>
=== European line ===
Starting in 2005, Fantagraphics began a European graphic novel line,<ref name=Kozinn>Kozinn, Allan. urltoken "Fantagraphics Seeks Support With a Kickstarter Campaign," New York Times (November 6, 2013)</ref> starting with the co-publication of the Ignatz Series, edited and produced by the Italian artist Igort. The publisher announced a deal with Jacques Tardi in March 2009, that would see co-publisher Thompson translate a large number of his books.<ref></ref>
=== New challenges ===
In 2006, Fantagraphics opened its own retail store, Fantagraphics Bookstore & Gallery, in Seattle's Georgetown neighborhood.
In early 2012, Michael Catron returned to Fantagraphics as editor with the company he had co-founded 36 years earlier.<ref>Spurgeon, Tom. urltoken "CR Newsmaker Interview: Mike Catron" The Comics Reporter (February 5, 2012).</ref><ref>Baehr, Mike. urltoken "Welcome back Mike Catron & Preston White!" The Comics Journal Blog (February 6, 2012).</ref>
Co-publisher Kim Thompson left Fantagraphics due to illness in March 2013,<ref>Ulin, David L. urltoken "Jacket Copy: Fantagraphics' co-publisher Kim Thompson has lung cancer," Los Angeles Times (March 7, 2013).</ref> and died of lung cancer a few months later.<ref></ref> His absence left the company without a number of titles it had been counting on for the summer and fall of 2013;<ref name=Kozinn /> and in November Fantagraphics started a Kickstarter campaign to raise $150,000, which it surpassed in four days.<ref name=Kozinn /><ref>Melrose, Kevin. urltoken "Fantagraphics surpasses its $150,000 Kickstarter goal," Robot6 (November 12, 2013).</ref>
In August 2020 the company rebranded from Fantagraphics Books to just Fantagraphics, to reflect its status as a digital publisher also. At the same time it introduced a more compact logo featuring a stylized ink pen nib and a torch.<ref></ref>
==Imprints==
===Ignatz series===
The Ignatz series is an international comic imprint. It is published by Fantagraphics (U.S.), Avant Verlag (Germany), Vertige Graphic (France), Oog & Blik (Holland), Coconino Press (Italy), and Sinsentido (Spain). It is named for Ignatz Mouse, a character in the comic strip Krazy Kat.
The books in the Ignatz series are designed midway between standard North American comic book pamphlet-size and graphic novel-size. Each title is 32-pages, two-color, saddle stitched, 8½" × 11", with jacket, priced at $7.95.
The Ignatz collection is edited and produced by Italian artist Igort. Fantagraphics editor Kim Thompson frequently provided translations.
===Eros Comix===
Eros Comix is an adult-oriented imprint of Fantagraphics, established in 1990 to publish pornographic comic books. Eros Comix sells anime videos, DVDs, adult comic books, and books of erotic art and photography. The 2006 Eros Comix print catalog sold over 470 items, including adult comic books and humorous glamour photography often featuring pin-up girls like Bettie Page.
Writer-artist Tom Sutton contributed work to Eros titles under the pseudonym "Dementia".<ref name=groth></ref>
