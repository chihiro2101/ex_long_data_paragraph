Sybase

==History==
*1984: Robert Epstein, Mark Hoffman, Jane Doughty, and Tom Haggin found Sybase (initially as System ware) in Epstein's home in Berkeley, California.<ref></ref><ref> urltoken Sybase, Inc. - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Sybase, Inc.</ref><ref> urltoken Managing and analyzing information with relational databases</ref> Their first commercial location is half of an office suite at 2107 Dwight Way in Berkeley. They set out to create a relational database management system (RDBMS) that will organize information and make it available to computers within a network.
*March 1986: Sybase enters into talks with Microsoft to license Data Server, a database product built to run on UNIX computers. Those talks lead to a product called Ashton-Tate/Microsoft SQL Server 1.0, shipping in May 1989.<ref></ref>
*1986: Sybase ships its first test programs.
*1987: Sybase formally releases the Sybase system, the first high-performance DBMS for online applications providing the Human Genome Project with licenses for the first generation of client-server relational databases. Rather than having a vast central bank of data stored in a large mainframe computer, the Sybase System provides for a Client–server model. Base calls the database server "Sybase SQL Server".
*1988: Sybase, Microsoft, and Ashton-Tate port the Sybase DBMS to the OS/2 platform. Microsoft markets the new product as SQL Server. The terms of the agreement give Microsoft a sole license to products on the Intel x86 platform. Ashton-Tate soon drops out.
*October 1989: Sybase releases additional products, introducing the Sybase Open Client-Server Interfaces — new software programs that provide generic client-server communication, allowing for greater connectivity within computer networks. Two phase commit protocols are included as part of Sybase SQL Server 3.0, as are stored procedures and triggers
*1989: Sybase achieves sales of $56 million.
* August 1991: Sybase goes public at a split adjusted price of $4.40. Sybase SQL server 4.0, and later 4.8 (the first smp server) and 4.9.1, all outperformed competitors by significant margins in standard benchmarks.
*1993: Sybase and Microsoft dissolve their partnership. Microsoft receives a copy of the SQL Server code base. In exchange Sybase is free to deploy on the x86 platform which has now become the chip of choice for Unix. Sybase SQL Server version 4.2 and Microsoft SQL Server are identical. Their Transact-SQL (T-SQL) procedural language is the same, as is the basic process architecture. From this point the products diverge as Microsoft includes more Windows features whilst Sybase adds Enterprise features (performance and scaling).
*April 1993: Sybase introduces the first component of System 10, called OmniSQL Gateway. This program connects the various parts of a computer network, enabling users to access data changes made within the network.
*June 1993: Sybase announces its latest generation of software, named the System 10 product family; this consists of the Database server, Replication Server for keeping replicate data up-to-date in near real time, and Navigation Server which had been developed in partnership with NCR to do shared nothing parallelisation across large numbers of databases. Backup Server is introduced to do high performance parallel backups and restores. SQL Monitor and SA Companion are provided to manage multiple servers.
*1994: Sybase acquires OASiS Group plc, a British management consulting firm of some 150 staff that implemented organisational change solutions as well as bespoke information systems. The acquisition was intended to position Sybase as a provider of enterprise business solutions but within 4 years the OASiS leadership team and most of its consultants had left.
*1994: Sybase acquires Powersoft, the leading maker of development tools for client-server computing, with 40 per cent of that market. Through the deal, Sybase acquires PowerBuilder, a rapid application development (RAD) tool and Powersoft's leading product. The acquisition also marks Sybase's entry into the enterprise mobility market with Watcom SQL, which Sybase renames SQL Anywhere. When Sybase launches its mobility subsidiary, Sybase iAnywhere, in 2000, SQL Anywhere becomes its flagship relational database management system (RDBMS) and helps the company to become the leader of the mobile database market. Sybase revenues are over $1bn.
*1994: Sybase acquires Micro Decisionware (MDI), a privately held middleware company based in Boulder, Colorado, USA. Its first product is PC/SQL-link, a tool that enables PC users to build SQL statements and send them to mainframe databases, with results returned to the PC. MDI's second product, the MDI Database Gateway, provided connectivity for PC-based applications (such as PowerBuilder) to execute SQL queries against mainframe databases. The MDI Database Gateway was in competition with the Sybase middleware product. After the acquisition, some MDI Database Gateway features were integrated into the Sybase product.
*1995: Sybase's flagship database product Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) V11.0 released. This was a major performance release giving massive scalability up to 16 processors. (100% for the first 15 and 25% for the 16th in a benchmark run for a UK government contract). This server outperformed all competitors in standard benchmarks. Sybase launches PowerDesigner, a modeling and metadata management product, following its acquisition of PowerAMC. Sybase share price peaks at $96.
*1996: Sybase renames the main product SQL Server to its current name Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) for version 11.5. Anywhere 5 is released. It includes SQL Remote, SQL Central, Transact SQL syntax, and support for the Sybase Replication Server.
*1996: Mitchell Kertzman, Powersoft CEO, was appointed CEO of Sybase. Sybase launched Sybase IQ, the first column-based analytics platform.
*January 1998: Sybase announced that it had found inconsistencies in profits reporting from its Japanese division, and would restate the financial results for the company for the last three quarters of 1997.<ref></ref> Five executives in Sybase's Japanese subsidiary were found to have used side letters to artificially inflate the profits from their operations. Following a class-action lawsuit,<ref></ref> the five executives involved were fired.
*November 1998: John S. Chen is appointed Chairman, CEO and President.<ref></ref>
*1998: SQL Anywhere 6 released, with new names Adaptive Server Anywhere as the engine and part of the SQL Anywhere Studio, which now includes SQL Modeler (later PowerDesigner), Java is introduced to the database.
*1999: Sybase's flagship database product Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) V12.0 released.
*2000: Sybase returns to profitability under the management of John S. Chen. iAnywhere Solutions, Inc. is founded as a subsidiary of Sybase.
