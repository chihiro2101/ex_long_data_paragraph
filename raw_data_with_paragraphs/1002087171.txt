Mayo Clinic

=== Contributions to medicine and science ===
In the early 20th century, Dr. Henry Plummer developed Mayo Clinic's multi-specialty group practice model and an integrated medical record system.<ref name="Snowbeck-09152017"></ref> Plummer's system allowed doctors to better share patient information with one another.<ref name="Snowbeck-09152017"/> Prior to Plummer's system, doctors worked in solo practice and shared patient information when necessary either verbally or by letter.<ref name="Snowbeck-09152017"/> Plummer also helped design and fabricate building systems innovations, such as steam sterilization rooms, metal surgical tools and equipment, pneumatic tube system, and knee operated sinks.<ref name="Campbell-082817"></ref><ref name="Grayson-042519"></ref> In 1905, Mayo Clinic advanced a technique of using frozen tissue during surgery to determine if a patient had cancer while the patient was still in the operating room.<ref name="Hansel-070514"></ref><ref name="Becker's-091214"></ref> Mayo Clinic offered the first graduate medical education program in 1915 and the first nonprofit practice aligned with medical education and research.<ref name="Becker's-091214"/> In the 1920s, Dr. Albert Compton Broders of the Mayo Clinic created the first index to grade tumors.<ref name="APLM-12"></ref> Mayo Clinic opened the first hospital-based blood bank in Rochester in 1935.<ref name="MayoHistory-091713"></ref> Early in Mayo Clinic's history, the hospital designed the one-legged mobile instrument stand known as the Mayo stand.<ref name="Meals2010"></ref>
In the 1930s, Mayo Clinic Drs. Walter M. Boothby, Randolph Lovelace, and Arthur Bulbulian developed a high-altitude mask for oxygen therapy that became known as the BLB flight mask.<ref name="Dill54"></ref>
During World War II, the U.S. Army tasked Mayo Clinic with finding a solution for pilots who were dying after suffering blackouts. Mayo Clinic hired a team of doctors to research and define the specific physiologic effects causing blackout and unconsciousness during high G forces.<ref name="Hansel-G-Suit"></ref> Physiologists Drs. Earl Wood, Edward Baldes, Charles Code, and Edward Lambert developed the G-suit with air bladders that prevented blood from pooling in pilots' legs.<ref name="Hansel-G-Suit"/> The suit was worn by U.S. pilots toward the end of World War II.<ref>WOOD EH, LAMBERT EH.

Two Mayo Clinic doctors were among three people awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1950 for the discovery of cortisone.<ref name="Hilchey080696"></ref> Professor Edward C. Kendall, PhD, and Dr. Philip S. Hench of Mayo Clinic were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine alongside Dr. Tadeus Reichstein, a Swiss chemist who conducted independent research, for the discovery.<ref name="Hilchey080696"/> They separated and identified compounds from the adrenal cortex that produced cortisone and hydrocortisone.<ref name="NYT-05051972"></ref> Later in the decade, Mayo Clinic began using and refining the Gibbon heart-lung machine in cardiac surgery. It is now known as the Mayo-Gibbon heart-lung machine.<ref name="NMAH-Mayo-Gibbon"></ref>
Mayo Clinic Drs. Edward Howard Lambert, Lealdes (Lee) McKendree Eaton, and Edward Douglas Rooke were the first physicians to substantially describe the clinic and electrophysiological findings of what is known as Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome in 1956.<ref></ref><ref></ref> In 1972, the clustering of LEMS with other autoimmune diseases led to the hypothesis that it was caused by autoimmunity.<ref></ref>
In 1969, Mayo Clinic doctors performed the first Food and Drug Administration-approved hip replacement in the United States.<ref name="Hansel-031007"></ref> In 1973, Mayo Clinic bought the first CT scanner in the U.S.<ref name="LAT-090708"></ref>

This research facility is designed to simulate real-world, non-hospital environments to allow Mayo Clinic researchers to study the interaction between indoor spaces and human health.<ref name="Stinson"></ref>
=== Architecture and art collection ===
As the practice grew in the 20th century, it required additional space. Saint Marys Hospital underwent frequent expansion. Rochester business leader John Kahler built innovative hotel-hospital facilities that served Mayo Clinic patients.<ref name="Clapesattle"/> In 1914, Mayo Clinic opened the world's first building expressly designed for multispecialty group practice, known as the 1914 "red brick" building.<ref name="Lens"></ref><ref name="Clapesattle"/> It facilitated ease of movement for patients and staff among specialty areas, brought research and education functions into proximity with clinical practice, and patient amenities.<ref name="Clapesattle"/><ref name="Fye"/> This approach was replicated and enhanced with the adjoining 1928 Mayo Clinic building, later named for Dr. Plummer,<ref name="Fye"/> its principal designer, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<ref name="Clapesattle"/><ref name="HistoricPlaces"></ref><ref name="Emporis-Plummer"></ref> The Plummer Building features bronze entry doors designed by artist Charles Brioschi. Each 16-foot high, 5.25-inch thick door weighs 4,000 pounds and features ornamental panels. The doors are closed to memorialize important historical events and influential people, such as the deaths of the Mayo brothers, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and the victims of September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.<ref name="PlummerDoors"></ref> The 1914 "red brick" building, a National Historic Landmark, was demolished by Mayo Clinic in the 1980s to make way for the Siebens Building (completed in 1989).<ref name="Lens"/><ref></ref> Mayo Clinic's campus has undergone expansion over the years.<ref name="Baier"></ref>
Other notable Mayo Clinic buildings include the Mayo Building (Rochester, Minnesota) (construction completed in 1955), Guggenheim Building (1974), Gonda Building (2001), Opus Imaging Research Building (2007) and recent addition in 2019 - Discovery Square building.

=== Educational programs ===
The first medical educational programs at Mayo Clinic were developed in 1915 with the assistance of the University of Minnesota.<ref name=kennedylab></ref><ref name=medicinehistory/> Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education and the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research were established in 1915.<ref name=boes></ref><ref></ref> MFMER was established as a department of the University of Minnesota with a $1.5 million donation to offer graduate programs at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester.<ref></ref> The Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education is now part of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, which is divided into five schools.<ref name=porter></ref><ref></ref> Those schools include Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine, Mayo Clinic School of Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development, and Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.<ref name="Burns"/>
In 2011, the foundation that oversees the Mayo Clinic went before the Supreme Court to argue that medical residents should remain exempt from Social Security deductions. In Mayo Foundation v. United States the court sided with the Social Security Administration and required FICA to be deducted going forward.<ref></ref>
In 2020, Mayo Clinic shut down a prominent lab working on federally funded research led by Dr. Jan van Deursen, who was accused of bullying trainees.<ref></ref>
=== Current practice ===
Mayo Clinic rules mandate that its CEOs must be physicians and come from within Mayo Clinic.<ref name="MayoCEOs"></ref> John H. Noseworthy, M.D., served as president and CEO from 2009 to 2019.<ref name="Newmarker"/> Under his leadership, Mayo Clinic was reorganized into a single operating company with a unified strategy and business plan, which helped the system expand.<ref name=Karnowski-081018/> This included the launch of the Destination Medical Center, a 20-year economic growth plan in Rochester.<ref name=Karnowski-081018/> During this time, annual revenue reached nearly $12 billion, and Mayo Clinic added 7,200 employees.<ref name=StarTribune-Snowbeck-200218/>
In 2018, Mayo Clinic announced that Gianrico Farrugia, M.D., a Mayo Clinic physician for more than 30 years, would replace Dr. Noseworthy as CEO.<ref name=ABC-NewCEO></ref> Dr. Farrugia had served as CEO of Mayo Clinic in Florida since 2015.<ref name=Karnowski-081018 /> The replacement adhered to Mayo Clinic's tradition of leadership changes, where a new president or CEO is named every seven to 10 years.<ref name="ModernHealthcare-Noseworthy"></ref> By 2018, Mayo Clinic doctors saw approximately 1.3 million patients annually.<ref name=ABC-NewCEO />
== Innovation ==
Mayo Clinic remains at the forefront of medical innovation leading hundreds of clinical trials and offering groundbreaking therapies, such as CAR-T and proton therapies. They are currently one of the leading research centers for the COVID-19 epidemic and were one of the first institutions offering plasma exchange for this patient population.
Mayo Clinic has adopted more than 15,000 mobile devices from Apple for patient care, including the iPad, iPad Mini, and iPhone. Mayo Clinic then created an app for these devices called Synthesis Mobile, which integrated hundreds of their health systems. For Mayo Clinic Care Network members, more apps were created to help patients see their medical records or ask clinicians for assistance.<ref></ref> In 2014, Mayo Clinic was developing an app for Apple's HealthKit to help users maintain healthy lifestyles and warn of certain health signs that need attention.<ref></ref>
Mayo Clinic, in collaboration with real estate firm Delos Living, launched the Well Living Lab in September 2015. This research facility is designed to simulate real-world, non-hospital environments to allow Mayo Clinic researchers to study the interaction between indoor spaces and human health.<ref name="Stinson"/>
The Mayo Clinic Center for Innovation, established in 2008, was one of the pioneers of innovation in healthcare. It has since worked on over 270 projects and is often looked to as a role model for using design in healthcare.<ref></ref>
In March 2018, Mayo Clinic and Mytonomy, a healthcare education system company, partnered to provide video content for cancer patients. The video content is used to address important questions and answers and designed to aid in the decision-making process between patient and doctor.<ref></ref>
In September 2019, Mayo Clinic entered into a strategic partnership with Google for health care innovation and cloud computing, and Google planned to open its facility in Rochester, Minnesota for Mayo Clinic.<ref></ref>
