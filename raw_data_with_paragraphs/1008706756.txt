Hazzan

== Sh'liaḥ tzibbur and the evolution of the hazzan ==
The person leading the congregation in public prayers is called the Shaliah tzibbur (Hebrew for "emissary of the congregation").<ref name="myjewishlearning.com"></ref> Halakha restricts this role to adult Jews; among Orthodox Jews, it is restricted to males. In theory, any lay person can be a sh'liaḥ tzibbur; many synagogue-attending Jews will serve in this role from time to time, especially on weekdays or when having a Yartzeit. Someone with good Hebrew pronunciation is preferred. In practice, in synagogues without an official Hazzan,<ref>or in the absence of the Hazzan, if there is no Hazzan Sheni</ref> those with the best voice and the most knowledge of the prayers serve most often.
As public worship was developed in the Geonim period and as the knowledge of the Hebrew language declined, singing gradually superseded the didactic and hortatory element in the worship in the synagogue. Thus, while the idea of a cantor as a paid professional does not exist in classical rabbinic sources, the office of the hazzan increased in importance with the centuries, evolving a specialized set of skills and becoming a career in itself.<ref></ref>
==Qualifications==
Even in the earliest times the chief qualifications demanded of the hazzan, in addition to knowledge of Biblical and liturgical literature as well as the prayer motifs (known as steiger), were a pleasant voice and an artistic delivery; for the sake of these, many faults were willingly overlooked. The hazzan was required to possess a pleasing appearance,<ref>U-FirKo NaEh, wording in the HiNeNi prayer recited by the Hazzan on the High Holidays</ref> to be married, and to have a flowing beard.<ref>The Jewish Encyclopedia,1906 (public domain), p.285, urltoken Sometimes, according to Isaac of Vienna (13th century), a young hazzan having only a slight growth of beard was tolerated. Maimonides decided that the hazzan who recited the prayers on an ordinary Shabbat and on weekdays need not possess an appearance pleasing to everybody; he might even have a reputation not wholly spotless, provided he was living a life morally free from reproach at the time of his appointment.
But all these moderations of the rule disappeared on holidays; then an especially worthy hazzan was demanded, one whose life was absolutely irreproachable, who was generally popular, and who was endowed with an expressive delivery. Even a person who had ever litigated in a non-Jewish court, instead of a Jewish court, could not act as hazzan on those days, unless he had previously done penance.<ref>Shulkhan Arukh, Orah Hayyim, 581</ref> However many authorities were lenient in this regard, and as long as a cantor was "merutzeh l'kehal," desired by the congregation, he was permitted to lead the prayers even on the holiest of days.
Today, a hazzan, particularly in more formal (usually not Orthodox) synagogues, is likely to have academic credentials—most often a degree in music or in sacred music, sometimes a degree in music education or in Jewish religious education or a related discipline. The doctor of music degree is sometimes awarded to honour a hazzan.
==Professional status==
The role of hazzanim as a respected full-time profession has become a reality in recent centuries. In the last two centuries Jews in a number of European communities, notably Germany and Britain, came to view professionally trained hazzanim as clergy<ref name="myjewishlearning.com"/> and the hazzan as the deputy rabbi. After the enlightenment, when European nations gave full citizenship and civil rights to Jews, professionally trained hazzanim were accepted by the secular governments as clergy just as rabbis were.
In a paradoxical turn of events, the United States government recognized cantors as the first Jewish clergy, even before rabbis were recognized: as a congregation could be organized and led by a committee of Jewish laypersons, who would not have the expertise in liturgy a hazzan would have, newly forming congregations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries sometimes hired a hazzan for a synagogue (and made sure that a kosher butcher was established in the neighborhood) for some time before setting about hiring a rabbi, seeing the hazzan (and the butcher) as a more immediate need. The hazzan therefore solemnized marriages and otherwise represented the congregation in the eyes of civil authorities.
In the United States, many hazzanim supplement their ministry by also earning certification as and working as mohels, for bris ceremonies.
In the United States there are three main organizations for professionally trained hazzanim, one from each of the major Jewish denominations:
*American Conference of Cantors—Reform Judaism<ref></ref>
*Cantors Assembly—Conservative Judaism<ref> urltoken Cantors Assembly</ref>
*Cantorial Council of America—Orthodox Judaism<ref> urltoken Belz School of Jewish Music</ref>
===Training===
Many members of the Cantors Assembly are trained at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America#Cantorial School at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. Many members of the American Conference of Cantors are trained at the Debbie Friedman School of Sacred Music at Hebrew Union College—Jewish Institute of Religion, School of Sacred Music (New York) Reform. Both of these programs offer a five-year training program. Members of the Cantorial Council can train at the Philip and Sarah Belz School of Jewish Music at Yeshiva University in New York City.
ALEPH, the movement for Jewish Renewal, includes a cantorial training program as part of its ordination program.
Full cantorial training is also offered by the Cantorial School of the Academy for Jewish Religion (California) in Los Angeles, the Cantorial Program at the similarly named Academy for Jewish Religion in New York, and the School of Jewish Music at Hebrew College. These institutions are unaffiliated with any particular Jewish denomination.
The curricula for students in these programs generally include, but are not limited to:
 
* Hebrew: modern, Biblical (Torah), and liturgical (siddur)
* Nusach (liturgical tradition)
* Laws and traditions pertaining to Jewish prayer service
* History and content of the siddur
* Music theory, sight-reading
* Playing an instrument, usually a piano or guitar
* Singing technique
* Cantillation—tropes for the liturgical chanting of biblical books
* Choral conducting
* Jewish history
* Tanakh (Hebrew Bible)
* Jewish music history
* Pastoral care and counseling
* Theology
===Non-Orthodox titles===
Until 2012, neither the Reform nor Conservative streams used the term "ordained" for trained cantors; use of the term "invested" precluded confusion with those they titled rabbi.<ref name=MyCant></ref> Conservative Judaism has retained that distinction.
==Female cantors in non-Orthodox Judaism==
Traditionally a hazzan was always a man. According to the Shulchan Aruch the code of Jewish law a Chazzan or cantor must be a male past the age of accepting the Mitzvos
Today most streams of non-Orthodox Judaism no longer maintain gender distinctions,<ref></ref> hence a woman can fill their cantorial needs.<ref name="myjewishlearning.com"/> Julie Rosewald, called “Cantor Soprano” by her congregation, was America's first female cantor (though she was born in Germany), serving San Francisco's Temple Emanu-El from 1884 until 1893.<ref name=JWA.Julie> urltoken Julie Rosewald: America's first woman cantor | Jewish Women's Archive</ref><ref> urltoken The Forgotten Woman Cantor: Julie Rosewald Now Getting Her Due | Jewish Week</ref> Barbara Ostfeld became the first female cantor to be ordained in Reform Judaism in 1975,<ref name=HUC.2011/><ref name="jwa.org"></ref> and Erica Lippitz and Marla Rosenfeld Barugel became the first female cantors in Conservative Judaism in 1987.<ref name="jwa.org"/> The Cantors Assembly, a professional organization of cantors associated with Conservative Judaism, did not allow women to join until 1990.<ref></ref> Sharon Hordes became the first cantor (female or otherwise) in Reconstructionist Judaism in 2002.<ref></ref> Avitall Gerstetter, who lived in Germany, became the first female cantor in Jewish Renewal (and the first female cantor in Germany) in 2002.

As of 2011, the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, the main seminary for Reform Judaism, has invested 208 women cantors.<ref name=HUC.2011></ref>
==Golden age==
The period between the two world wars is often referred to as the "golden age" of hazzanut (cantorial performance). The great figures of this era include Zavel Kwartin (1874–1953), Moritz Henle (1850–1925), Yossele Rosenblatt (1882–1933), Gershon Sirota (1874–1943), and Leib Glantz.
In the post–World War II period, prominent cantors were Moshe Koussevitzky, David Werdyger, Frank Birnbaum, Richard Tucker and Abraham Lopes Cardozo (1914–2006). Operatic tenor Jan Peerce, whose cantorial recordings were highly regarded, was never a cantor by profession but often served as one during the High Holidays.
Popular contemporary cantors include Shmuel Barzilai, Naftali Hershtik, Yitzchak Meir Helfgot, Chazzan Avraham Aharon Weingarten, Ari Klein, Yaakov Lemmer, Joseph Malovany, Benzion Miller, Jacob (Jack) Mendelson, Aaron Bensoussan, Aaron Aderet, Alberto Mizrahi, Yaakov Yoseph Stark, Jochen (Yaacov) Fahlenkamp, Meir Finkelstein, Daniel Gross,<ref></ref> Azi Schwartz, Netanel Hershtik and Eli Weinberg.
==Hazzan Sheni==
The title Hazzan Sheni<ref></ref><ref></ref> (Sheni means second) can refer to
* a Hazzan who plays that role when the main Hazzan does not officiate
* a Hazzan who fills a different spot, such as when the main Hazzan leads Musaf, and the Sheni leads Shacharit.
