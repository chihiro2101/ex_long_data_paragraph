==Transport==
===Air===
Copenhagen Airport is the largest airport in Scandinavia. The airport is located at Kastrup, 8&nbsp;km from central Copenhagen. It is connected by train to Copenhagen Central Station and beyond as well as to Malmö and other towns in Sweden.
For the west of the country, the major airport is Billund although both Aarhus, Aalborg, and Karup have smaller airports with regular connections to Copenhagen.
===Rail===
Denmark has a good national railway network. There are also frequent train services to Malmö and other parts of Sweden. Germany is connected both by rail services using the ferries from Puttgarden to Rødby and by services across the Flensburg-Padborg land border in the south of Jutland.
===Road===
Motorways are well developed across the country, the only tolls being on the major bridges (over the Great Belt and to Malmö).
===Bicycles===
Outside of the towns and cities there are often bicycle tracks parallel to, but separated from, the roads between towns. During the summer months, there are free "city bikes" stationed at various spots in the downtown area of Copenhagen and Aarhus. The idea is that anyone can take a bike from one of the spots, ride it to another spot and leave it there for the next person.
There are numerous national and regional bicycle routes throughout Denmark. They are all marked and include rest areas with benches and other necessities.
===Sea===
International overnight ferry services connect Oslo, Norway, to Copenhagen every day. Harwich, south-east England, used to be connected to Esbjerg, west Jutland three times a week.<ref> urltoken Routes and Timetable, DFDS Seaways.

Denmark has long stretches of sandy beaches, attracting many tourists in the summer, with Germany accounting for most foreign visitors. Swedish and Norwegian tourists often come to visit the relatively lively city of Copenhagen, while many young Scandinavians come for Denmark's comparably cheap and readily accessible beer, wines and spirits.
As Europe's oldest kingdom and the home of Hans Christian Andersen, Denmark is often marketed as a "fairytale country".

Denmark has a relatively large outbound tourism, with Spain as primary destination, accounting for 14% of all overnight stays abroad of four days or more in 2013. Turkey ranks as the primary destination outside of Europe at 7%.<ref name=EuroMonitor/><ref></ref>
