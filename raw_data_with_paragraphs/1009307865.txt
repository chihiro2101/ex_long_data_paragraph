Saint Lawrence

== Veneration ==
Due to his conspiring to hide and protect the written documents of the Church, Lawrence is known as the patron saint of archivists and librarians.<ref>Owens, B. (2003). "The safeguarding of memory: The divine function of the librarian and archivist" . Library & Archival Security, 18(1), 9–41</ref>
=== Roman Catholic Church ===
Lawrence is one of the most widely venerated saints of the Roman Catholic Church. Legendary details of his death were known to Damasus, Prudentius, Ambrose, and Augustine. Devotion to him was widespread by the fourth century. His liturgical celebration on 10 August has the rank of feast in the General Roman Calendar, consistent with the oldest of Christian calendars, e. g. the Almanac of Philocalus for the year 354, the inventory of which contains the principal feasts of the Roman martyrs of the middle of the fourth century. He remains one of the saints enumerated in the "Roman Canon" of the Holy Mass as celebrated in the Latin Church.
Lawrence is especially honoured in the city of Rome, of which he is considered the third patron after St. Peter and St. Paul.<ref>Parrocchia Santa Maria Assunta, Amaseno, "I Luoghi di San Lorenzo a Roma", urltoken accessed 13 March 2017.</ref> The church built over his tomb, the Papal Minor Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, became one of the seven principal churches of Rome and a favourite place of Roman pilgrimages.<ref name=foley> urltoken Foley, OFM, Leonard, "St. Lawrence", Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons, and Feast (Revised by Pat McCloskey, OFM), Franciscan Media </ref> The area proximate to the Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura is named the "Quartiere San Lorenzo".
Because the Perseids typically occurs annually in mid-August on or proximate to his feast day, some refer to the shower as the "Tears of St Lawrence".<ref name=slocc/>
His intercession to God is invoked by librarians, archivists, comedians, cooks and tanners as their patron. He is the patron saint of Ampleforth Abbey, whose Benedictine monks founded one of the world's leading public schools for Catholics, located in North Yorkshire (North East England).
On his feast the reliquary containing his burnt head is displayed in the St. Peter's Basilica for veneration.
=== Anglican Communion ===
Within Anglicanism Lawrence's name is traditionally spelled Laurence or Lawrence. His feast is on 10 August which is in the calendar of the Book of Common Prayer, the volume of prayers which, in its 1662 format, was the founding liturgical document of a majority of Anglican provinces. In the Book of Common Prayer the feast is titled "S Laurence, Archdeacon of Rome and Martyr". His feast on 10 August has been carried into the contemporary calendars of most Anglican provinces,<ref>See, for example, "An Anglican Prayer Book" (1989), the Province of Southern Africa, published by Collins Liturgical, , Calendar, page 24.</ref> including the Church of England,<ref>See "Common Worship" (2000) core edition, published by Church House Publishing, , Calendar, page 12.</ref> which designates it as a lesser festival under the title "Laurence, deacon, martyr, 258".
Anglo-Catholics venerate Lawrence, who is the patron of many Anglican parish churches, including 228 in England.<ref>The Oxford Dictionary of Saints, published by Oxford University Press, (paperback), cites 228 churches.</ref><ref>The Church of England official index ( urltoken ACNY) cites 224 spelt "Lawrence" and "Laurence".</ref> A major church in Sydney, Australia, in the former civil parish of St Laurence, is known as "Christ Church St Laurence". The Anglican charitable society, Brotherhood of St Laurence also bears his name.

According to Francesco Moraglia the role of deacon is distinguished by service of the poor. He is destined both to the service of the table (corporal works of mercy) and to the service of the word (spiritual works of mercy). "The beauty, power and the heroism of deacons such as Lawrence help to discover and come to a deeper meaning of the special nature of the diaconal ministry."<ref name=moraglia/>
Many churches, schools, parishes, towns, and geographic features throughout the world are named for Lawrence of Rome. Depending on locality they are named St. Lawrence, St. Laurence, San Lorenzo, St. Laurent, St. Lorenz or similarly in other languages. El Escorial, the monastery built by King Philip II of Spain, commemorates his victory at the Battle of St. Quentin (1557) on the Feast of St. Lawrence.<ref name="Fodor's Review 2008"></ref> The monastery and the attached palace, college, and library are laid out in a grid pattern that resembles the gridiron of Lawrence's martyrdom. The gridiron of Lawrence is also thought the basis of the design of the Certosa di Padula, which is a monastery in Padula, Salerno, Italy. Two universities bear his name: St. Lawrence University (non-Catholic) in Canton, St. Lawrence County, New York, United States, and St. Lawrence University in Kampala, Uganda.
On his second voyage, French explorer Jacques Cartier, arriving in the river estuary of the Great Lakes on the Feast of St. Lawrence in 1535, named it the Gulf of St. Lawrence.<ref>
</ref>
The river emptying into the gulf was named the St. Lawrence River. Many names in what are now Québec and the Maritime Provinces of Canada are references to this important seaway, e. g., the Laurentian mountains north of the city of Montreal, Saint-Laurent (borough), Saint Lawrence Boulevard which spans the width of the Island of Montreal, and St. Lawrence County, New York, United States near Lake Ontario. In Switzerland, Saint Lawrence is represented on the coat of arms of the city of Bülach.
The rescue operation for the miners trapped in the 2010 Copiapó mining accident in Chile was named Operacíon San Lorenzo after Lawrence, patron saint of miners.<ref> urltoken Oppman, Patrick. "Faith plays key role for trapped Chilean miners, families", CNN, September 9th, 2010</ref>
In Freemasonry the Order of St. Lawrence the Martyr is a masonic degree whose ritual is based upon the story of Lawrence. It is one of the constituent degrees of the Allied Masonic Degrees.

The mediaeval Church of St Mary Assumed (Chiesa di Santa Maria Assunta) in the small commune of Amaseno, Lazio, Italy houses the famous reliquary of the ampulla containing relics of Lawrence, namely a quantum of his blood, a fragment of his flesh, some fat and ashes. Tradition holds that annually, on the Feast of St. Lawrence, and sometimes on other occasions, the blood in the ampulla miraculously liquefies during the Feast and re-coagulates by the following day.<ref> urltoken Parrocchia Santa Maria Assunta in Amaseno, Lazio, Italy;</ref>
