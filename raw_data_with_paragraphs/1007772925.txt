As of 2014, Bush had received more than 2 million from his work for Tenet, a company that expected to receive 100 million in new earnings in 2014 because of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and that "aggressively encouraged Americans to sign up for insurance under the program."<ref name=Barbaro /> Bush has reportedly objected to the ACA at company meetings, but has kept his personal views separate from what is best for Tenet.<ref name=Barbaro />
Bush owns several international stocks.<ref></ref>
== 2016 presidential campaign ==
Bush had been considered a potential candidate in the 2016 presidential election since the end of the 2012 election.<ref name=NYT2016></ref>

On December 16, 2014, Bush announced via Facebook that he would be "actively exploring" a 2016 run to become President of the United States and at the end of the year resigned several corporate boards.<ref name="actively exploring"></ref><ref></ref>
In February 2015, Bush released several thousand emails from his time as governor online. Most of the emails are in the public record under Florida's Sunshine Laws. However, Bush created controversy by releasing some emails that included some personal details such as social security numbers, names, and addresses, as well as the contents of the messages.<ref name=Mendoza></ref><ref> urltoken Jeb Bush camp blames Florida for unredacted emails Kendall Breitman, Politico, February 10, 2015</ref> Bush's campaign team subsequently redacted the personal information.<ref></ref>
By extending the exploration mode of his potential candidacy to a six-month period (his scheduled announcement came one day short of six months into his exploratory phase), Bush used his time to get acquainted with the press, court donors, and prepare a strategy. In doing this, he navigated several campaign finance laws which limit donations and prohibit coordination with Super PACs.<ref>Frumin, Aliyah. urltoken "Jeb Bush exploits major loophole in campaign finance rule" , MSNBC (May 2, 2015).</ref> In May 2015, it was reported that Bush had been raising money since January 2015, estimated to be close to 100 million, for his super PAC, Right to Rise.<ref>Frumin, Aliyah.

After a series of poor results in Iowa and New Hampshire, Bush spent his remaining money and campaign effort on the South Carolina primary. He placed fourth with under 8% of the vote. That night, Bush suspended his campaign, ending his presidential bid, and subsequently endorsed Texas Senator Ted Cruz.<ref></ref><ref>Lee, M. J. urltoken "Donald Trump and Jeb Bush aren't on the same planet" CNN (October 9, 2015).</ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> In an analysis of what went wrong, POLITICO argues that: "His slow, awkward stumble from August through October encapsulates everything that caused the operation viewed as 'Jeb!, Inc.' to fail. Bush was on the wrong side of the most galvanizing issues for Republican primary voters, he himself was a rusty and maladroit campaigner and his campaign was riven by internal disagreements and a crippling fear that left them paralyzed and unable to react to Trump."<ref>Eli Stokols, urltoken "Inside Jeb Bush's $150 Million Failure His closest aides failed to predict Trump and never changed course, guiding a flawed candidate into a corner he couldn't escape."

He also argued that the invasion—though perhaps inspired by faulty intelligence—had been beneficial, saying the world was "significantly safer" without Saddam Hussein in power.<ref></ref>
