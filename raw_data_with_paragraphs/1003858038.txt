McDonaldland

==History==
===Early years (1970–1972)===
McDonaldland was created by DDB Worldwide in 1970–71 at the request of McDonald's for its restaurants. The first commercial aired in January 1971. The early commercials were built on an upbeat, bubblegum-style tune and feature a narrator; many have plots that involve various villains, like the Hamburglar, Evil Grimace, and Captain Crook trying to steal a corresponding food item but are constantly foiled by Ronald.<ref name=":0"></ref>
In 1976, Remco created a line of action figures to celebrate the characters.<ref name=":0" />
===Lawsuit (1973)===
In 1973, Sid and Marty Krofft sued McDonald's by claiming that the entire McDonaldland premise Plagiarism their television show. The Kroffts also claimed that the character Mayor McCheese was an infringement on their copyrighted character "H.R. Pufnstuf" (a mayor himself). At trial, a jury found in favor of the Kroffts and McDonald's was ordered to pay $50,000. The case was appealed by both parties to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The appeals court, in the 1977 decision of Sid & Marty Krofft Television Productions Inc. v. McDonald's Corp., reassessed damages in favor of the Kroffts to more than $1,000,000.<ref name=":0" /><ref></ref> As a result, McDonald's was ordered to stop producing many of the characters and to stop airing commercials featuring the characters.<ref name=":0" />
===Popularity (1980–1998)===
In the 1980s and 1990s, the McDonaldland commercials remained a popular marketing device. The characters that remained following the lawsuit were Ronald McDonald, Grimace, Hamburglar and the French Fry Gobblins (renamed the Fry Guys and later the Fry Kids with the addition of the Fry Girls) while Mayor McCheese, Officer Big Mac, Captain Crook and the Professor were used until 1985. (However, they did return for a Sears advertisement in 1987). Birdie the Early Bird would join the lineup soon after representing the restaurant's new breakfast line in the early 1980s. Some of the characters' physical appearances were revised in later commercials (notably Hamburglar, Grimace and Birdie). From then on the characters lived in reality and interacted with real-life people, but commercials still took place in "McDonaldland". Soon after the Happy Meal Gang and the McNugget Buddies were prominent features in the commercials (representing the restaurant's Happy Meals and Chicken McNuggets respectively, being the menu items that mainly appealed to kids) along with Ronald.
Merchandise featuring the McDonaldland characters included a kid-friendly magazine titled "McDonaldland Fun Times", which published six issues a year. A direct-to-video animated film titled The Adventures of Ronald McDonald: McDonaldland Treasure Island was released in 1989, featuring much of the McDonaldland characters from the 1980s. Video games featuring the characters were also released, such as M.C. Kids and McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure.
===Later years (1998–2003)===
From 1998 until 2003, Rugrats creators Klasky Csupo and McDonald's released an animated direct-to-video series exclusively on VHS titled The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald. The series depicted Ronald, Grimace, Birdie, the Hamburglar and a few new characters, like Ronald's pessimistic dog Sundae. These videos would begin in live-action in what resembled a futuristic McDonaldland. Whenever the characters would enter down a tube or other means of travel, they would become animated. In all six episodes, Ronald goes on adventures with his friends and they learn new things along the way.
In the early 2000s, McDonald's experimented with the possibility of animating the characters to improve ratings. Various spots featuring the Hamburglar and other characters alongside celebrities were planned but were canceled. A conflict emerged between agencies regarding whether to continue using the characters or to follow through the desire of ad agency Leo Burnett by elevating the "I'm lovin' it" campaign and phasing out the characters, resulting in McDonald's choosing the latter option and completely retiring the McDonaldland characters.
===Legacy===
In recent years, the McDonaldland premise has largely been dropped out of advertising campaigns and Happy Meal toys. Despite this, the characters continued to appear in McDonald's PlayPlaces, decorative seats for children's birthday parties and bibs, though only Ronald McDonald, Birdie, Grimace, Hamburglar and the Fry Kids appear in them. They also appeared on some soft drink cups until 2008 and still appear as cookies in pouches titled "McDonaldland Cookies".
Today, the characters also appear on the windows of some McDonald's restaurants. Modern commercials nowadays depict Ronald McDonald alone in real-world situations with children, whether he visits a local McDonald's restaurant or to visit sick children at a Ronald McDonald House. Grimace, however, had a non-speaking appearance in an advertisement for Monsters vs. Aliens Happy Meal toys while the Hamburglar appeared in an adult-oriented commercial advertising the Big Mac.
==Characters==
* Ronald McDonald – The primary cultural icon and official mascot of McDonald's. He is a clown with red hair and a big red smile who wears a yellow jumpsuit and red shoes. While his suit has gone through various changes over the years, it has basically remained the same.
* Hamburglar (performed by Frank Delfino from 1971-1992, Jerry Maren in some commercials, Tommy Vicini from 1992 to 2003,<ref name="The Los Angeles Times"></ref><ref name="San Jose Mercury News"></ref> voiced by Larry Storch from 1971 to 1986, Howard Morris from 1986 to 2003, Charlie Adler in some commercials during the mid 1980s and in The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald, and Carl W. Wolfe in some commercials during the 1990s<ref name="Voice Chasers"> urltoken McDonald's at Voice Chasers, vocal credits.</ref>) – A pint-sized burglar who was introduced in 1971 as one of the first antagonists of the commercials where he often attempts to steal burgers from Ronald. Originally, Hamburglar spoke in a gibberish language which had to be translated by Captain Crook. He was reintroduced in 1985 as one of the main protagonists where he spoke in normal sentences. In 2015, McDonald's brought back the Hamburglar as part of the promotion of a new sirloin burger.<ref>Katie Lobosco, " urltoken McDonald's has a new Hamburglar", CNNMoney (May 7, 2015).</ref>
* Grimace (performed by Patty Saunders, voiced by Lennie Weinrib from 1971 to 1986, Frank Welker and sometimes Larry Moran from 1986 to 2003,<ref name="Voice Chasers"/> Kevin Michael Richardson in The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald) – A large purple monster who was first introduced in November 1971 as the "Evil Grimace". In Grimace's first appearances, he was one of the original main antagonists and was depicted with two pairs of arms which were used to steal sodas and shakes. "Evil" was soon dropped from Grimace's name and he was reintroduced in 1972 as a protagonist where he only has one set of arms. He is then a rather clumsy but still amiable monster from then on.
* Mayor McCheese (performed by Billy Curtis from 1971–1979, Jerry Maren from 1980–1985, voiced by Howard Morris impersonating Ed Wynn in the commercials,<ref name="Voice Chasers"/> Bob Joles impersonating Wynn in The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald) – An enormous cheeseburger-headed character who first appeared in 1971 and was removed in 1985. He sported a top hat, a diplomat's sash and a pair of pince-nez spectacles and was portrayed as McDonaldland's bumbling and incompetent mayor. He was the subject of a lawsuit filed by Sid and Marty Krofft for similarities to H.R. Pufnstuf.
* Officer Big Mac (performed by Jerry Maren, voiced by Ted Cassidy<ref name="Voice Chasers"/>) – Introduced in 1971 and was dropped in 1985, he is similar to Mayor McCheese in appearance that he has a large burger for a head. In his case, his head is a Big Mac (minus the vegetables and special sauce) rather than a cheeseburger. Officer Big Mac is the chief of police and as such he wears a constable uniform with a disproportionately small custodian helmet resting atop his head bun. As the main source of law and order in McDonaldland, Officer Big Mac spends most of his time chasing Hamburglar and Captain Crook.

* The Professor (portrayed by Lou Wagner, voiced by John Stephenson in the 1970s, Andre Stojka in the 1980s<ref name="Voice Chasers"/>) – A scientist who is McDonaldland's inventor and researcher. He was introduced in 1971 and has invented different devices throughout McDonaldland like the Psychedelic Electronic Hamburger Machine (which made only pumpkins for some reason), the Dinner Gong, an invisible car that helped Ronald McDonald get to McDonald's to meet with the kids, a magnetic bat, and the Chicken McNugget Dip-O-Matic. In his first appearance, he was a bespectacled man with a short beard, neck-length hair, and a hat. In later appearances in the 70s, he was a bespectacled man with a long beard. In the 80s, he was a bespectacled man with a moustache, a long nose, and a helmet with a lightbulb on it. The character was dropped in 1985.
* Fry Kids (various voices in the commercials, Kath Soucie, Paul Greenberg and Nika Futterman in The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald) – Introduced in 1972 as "Gobblins", the Fry Kids are small, shaggy, ball-like creatures with legs and no arms who try to steal other characters' French fries.

* The McNugget Buddies (variously voiced by Hal Rayle, Frank Welker, Katie Leigh, Greg Berg, Pat Musick, Don Messick, and Pat Fraley in the commercials,<ref name="Voice Chasers"/> Pamela Adlon, Lisa Raggio and Charlie Adler in The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald) – A bunch of anthropomorphic regular-sized Chicken McNuggets who were introduced in 1984.

* Ronald McDonald appears during a child's birthday party at a McDonald's in one scene of the film Mac & Me. He is portrayed by Squire Fridell, who played Ronald in commercials during the latter half of the 1980s.
* Mayor McCheese makes appearances in three episodes of the Fox animated television series Family Guy: "Believe It or Not, Joe's Walking on Air", "Road to the Multiverse" and "Valentine's Day in Quahog"; in all three episodes, he is voiced by John Viener. In "Believe it or Not, Joe's Walking on Air," Mayor McCheese is told by Dr. Hartman why they can't perform a specific surgery on him. In "Road to the Multiverse," Stewie and Brian visit a post-apocalyptic alternate reality where Frank Sinatra wasn't born to influence Kennedy's election, and as a result, Richard Nixon won the 1960 election and botched the Cuban Missile Crisis, causing World War III. When Brian asks, due to the circumstances, if Lee Harvey Oswald never shot Kennedy, Stewie replies, "No, he shot Mayor McCheese" as a cutaway shows him getting shot in the head during a motorcade; as the crowd gasps and screams, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis begins eating the hamburger meat splattered over the car. After the gag, Brian questions Stewie as to whether the joke was or was not in bad taste, Stewie replies, "Who cares? He's a cheeseburger." In "Valentine's Day in Quahog," Mayor McCheese was revealed to be another mayor that had an affair with Carol Pewterschmidt after Mayor Adam West defeated the unnamed Mayor of Weekapaug.

McDonaldland is a fantasy world used in the marketing for McDonald's restaurants during the 1970s through the 1990s. McDonaldland is inhabited by Ronald McDonald and other characters. In addition to being used in advertising, the characters were used as the basis for equipment in the "PlayPlaces" attached to some McDonald's outlets. The McDonaldland commercials featuring the characters were dropped from McDonald's advertising in 2003, but Ronald McDonald is still seen in commercials and in Happy Meal toys.
