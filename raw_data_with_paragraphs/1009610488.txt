Tampere University of Technology

==History==
From the late 19th century, Tampere had been the most important industrial center in Finland.<ref> urltoken Koskivoimaa. 1918-40. University of Tampere. Retrieved 2008-11-20. </ref> The Technical Institute of Tampere had provided engineers for its industries since 1911,<ref> urltoken Koskivoimaa. Teollisuuskoulu. University of Tampere. Retrieved 2008-11-20. </ref> but all higher technological education in Finland took place in Helsinki University of Technology. In the 1950s, the city of Tampere started actively remedying the situation, first founding a municipal science library in 1955. This library formed the core for the libraries of the TUT and the medical faculty of the University of Tampere<ref> urltoken Virstanpylväät. TTY:n kirjasto. Retrieved 2008-11-20.</ref> In 1960, city succeeded in persuading the small private university Yhteiskunnallinen korkeakoulu to move to Tampere from Helsinki. A few years later, this university changed its name to University of Tampere.<ref> urltoken Yhteiskunnallinen korkeakoulu. Koskivoimaa. University of Tampere. Retrieved 2008-11-20. </ref>
The founding of the Tampere University of Technology was one of the steps of the city and the local business life in bringing higher education to the region. The university was founded in 1965 as a branch of Helsinki University of Technology and became an independent university status in 1972. The Student Union of Tampere University of Technology (Tampereen teknillisen yliopiston ylioppilaskunta, TTYY) was also established alongside the university.
In 2003, the university changed its Finnish name from TTKK (Tampereen teknillinen korkeakoulu) to TTY (Tampereen teknillinen yliopisto) so that the Finnish name would be closer to the English name and to distinguish itself from polytechnics that are not universities in the meaning of the Humboldtian university ideal or in the meaning of the Finnish law.
As a part of the Finnish university reform, Tampere University of Technology chose to become one of the two Finnish universities operating as foundations in the beginning of 2010. The university hopes that compared to the previous form of state agency, the foundation form gives it more operational freedom.<ref> urltoken TUT Foundation. TUT. 2009-12-17. Retrieved 2010-01-12.</ref>
A programme, called Tampere3, to merge the university with University of Tampere and Tampere University of Applied Sciences was started in the spring of 2014. The merger was approved by Parliament in December 2017 and came into effect on 1 January 2019. The new foundation-based interdisciplinary higher education institution is named Tampere University.<ref> urltoken Tampere3. 2017-12-13. Retrieved 2018-02-01.</ref> The new university will comprise 35,000 students and 5,000 employees, thus, being the second largest university in Finland.<ref> urltoken Tampere3 Retrieved 2018-02-01.</ref>

==Research==
Tampere University of Technology is primarily a research university, which specializes in technology and architecture. While all departments pursue scientific research and publish in international, peer-reviewed journals, the strongest areas of the university are signal processing, nanophotonics, biotechnology, and intelligent mobile hydraulic systems.<ref> urltoken About TUT. TUT. Retrieved 2008-11-20.</ref> The university has one Finnish Center of Excellence, the Signal Processing Laboratory. In addition, it participates in two other Finnish Centers of Excellence. Among other things, the university has been developing the world's first: biodegradable joint implant, communicator, yellow laser and walking harvester.
In 2014, the researchers of TUT published 1586 papers in peer-reviewed international publications, meaning an average of a more than one article per researcher. The university has 133 full professors, 193 tenured lecturers, and 754 researchers, of which 22% are international employees.<ref name="Annual Report 2014"> urltoken Annual Report 2014. TUT (Annual report 2014, TUT). Retrieved 2015-10-15.</ref>
Tampere University of Technology has been selected three times as one of the best universities under 50 years old by Times Higher Education and QS World University Rankings has ranked it twice among the best 50 young universities in the World.<ref> urltoken THE 100 under 50.</ref><ref> urltoken QS Top 50 Under 50 2015.</ref>
===Research assessment 2011===
An international independent team made an assessment of research quality in TUT in 2011.<ref name="tut.fi"> urltoken The Assessment Scale was: Outstanding International Level (5), Very Good International Level (4), Good International Level (3), Fair International Level (2), and Poor International Level (1). When comparing the results between different faculties, the results are not comparable as the assessment was done by different group of people for different faculties. Intra-faculty comparisons however can be done based on the results. Furthermore, the numerical evaluations were accompanied with the verbal assessments, which give better understanding than the plain integer numbers.<ref name="tut.fi"/> Overall, the results were mostly in the range of Very Good and Good International Level.
===HR excellence in research===
In recognition of development activities related to research careers and the position of researchers at the University, the European Commission awarded Tampere University of Technology the right to use the HR Excellence in Research logo in spring 2014.
The logo demonstrates that the working conditions and career opportunities of research staff at TUT comply with recommendations given by the European Commission in The European Charter for Researchers and The Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers. The Charter & Code aim to give equal rights and obligations to individual researchers throughout Europe, therefore improving mobility and working conditions as well as reinforcing research and development across Europe.<ref> urltoken Tampere University of Technology.

Student life at Tampere is especially vivid as three universities are located at the area. The students of technology (teekkarit) are especially noticeable, as they wear a distinctive hat with a tuft (teekkarilakki) on many occasions, both formal and informal. These student caps with a tuft are shared by every university in Finland that educates students of technology but the caps are slightly visually different in every university. Students of technology are also famous for student pranks (Finnish: jäynä), similar in principle to MIT hacks.
All undergraduate students are members of the Student Union of Tampere University of Technology. Post-graduate students are given the option of joining. In addition to the student union, students join numerous associations for studies, cultural activity, and sports. Each of the 14 guilds at TUT serve the students in their respective study program and has their uniquely coloured student boilersuit.<ref> urltoken Student Union of TUT – Guilds , ttyy.fi.

Tampere University of Technology (TUT) was Finland's second-largest university in engineering sciences. The university was located in Hervanta, a suburb of Tampere. It was merged with the University of Tampere to create the new Tampere University on 1 January 2019.
The university's statutory duty was to pursue research and give the highest education in its field. The research, conducted by some 1,800 staff and faculty members, mostly focused on applied science and often has close ties to many different companies (such as Nokia). Located next to the university campus is a Technology Centre Hermia, including a large Nokia research facility. TUT was one of the only two Finnish universities which operate as foundation.The yearly budget of the university was some 147 million euros. Close to 50% of its budget was external funding.<ref> urltoken According to Times Higher Education, it ranked 11th in the world, and 4th in Europe, for industry collaboration.<ref> urltoken Times Higher Education.
