Kip Thorne

===Wormholes and time travel===
Thorne and his co-workers at Caltech conducted scientific research on whether the laws of physics permit space and time to be multiply connected (can there exist classical, traversable wormholes and "time machines"?).<ref></ref> With Sung-Won Kim, Thorne identified a universal physical mechanism (the explosive growth of vacuum polarization of quantum fields), that may always prevent spacetime from developing closed timelike curves (i.e., prevent backward time travel).<ref></ref>
With Mike Morris and Ulvi Yurtsever, he showed that traversable wormholes can exist in the structure of spacetime only if they are threaded by quantum fields in quantum states that violate the averaged null energy condition (i.e. have negative renormalized energy spread over a sufficiently large region).<ref></ref> This has triggered research to explore the ability of quantum fields to possess such extended negative energy. Recent calculations by Thorne indicate that simple masses passing through traversable wormholes could never engender paradoxes – there are no initial conditions that lead to paradox once time travel is introduced. If his results can be generalized, they would suggest that none of the supposed paradoxes formulated in time travel stories can actually be formulated at a precise physical level: that is, that any situation in a time travel story turns out to permit many consistent solutions.
===Relativistic stars, multipole moments and other endeavors===
With Anna Żytkow, Thorne predicted the existence of Red giants with neutron star cores (Thorne–Żytkow objects).<ref name="tz77"></ref> He laid the foundations for the theory of pulsations of relativistic stars and the gravitational radiation they emit. With James Hartle, Thorne derived from general relativity the laws of motion and precession of black holes and other relativistic bodies, including the influence of the coupling of their multipole moments to the spacetime curvature of nearby objects,<ref></ref> as well as writing down the Hartle-Thorne metric, an approximate solution which describes the exterior of a slowly and rigidly rotating, stationary and axially symmetric body.
Thorne has also theoretically predicted the existence of universally antigravitating "exotic matter" – the element needed to accelerate the expansion rate of the universe, keep traversable wormhole "Star Gates" open and keep timelike geodesic free float "warp drives" working. With Clifford Will<ref></ref> and others of his students, he laid the foundations for the theoretical interpretation of experimental tests of general relativity – foundations on which Will and others then built. , Thorne was interested in the origin of classical space and time from the quantum foam of quantum gravity theory.
==Publications==
Thorne has written and edited books on topics in gravitational theory and High-energy astronomy. In 1973, he co-authored the textbook Gravitation with Charles Misner and John Wheeler;<ref></ref> that according to John C. Baez and Chris Hillman, is one of the great scientific books of all time and has inspired two generations of students.<ref></ref> In 1994, he published Black Holes and Time Warps, a book for non-scientists for which he received numerous awards. This book has been published in six languages, and editions in Chinese, Italian, Czech, and Polish are in press. In 2014, Thorne published The Science of Interstellar in which he explains the science behind Christopher Nolan's film Interstellar; Nolan wrote the foreword to the book. In September 2017, Thorne and Roger D. Blandford published Modern Classical Physics: Optics, Fluids, Plasmas, Elasticity, Relativity, and Statistical Physics, a graduate-level textbook covering the six major areas of physics listed in the title.<ref name="Thorne2017"></ref>

==Adaptation in media==
*Thorne contributed ideas on wormhole travel to Carl Sagan for use in his novel Contact.<ref name="Tech"></ref>
*Thorne and his friend, producer Lynda Obst, also developed the concept for the Christopher Nolan film Interstellar.<ref></ref> He also wrote a tie-in book, The Science of Interstellar. Thorne later advised Nolan on the physics of his movie Tenet.<ref name="Maddox-Aug2020"></ref>
*In Larry Niven's novel Rainbow Mars, the time travel technology used in the novel is based on the wormhole theories of Thorne, which in the context of the novel was when time travel first became possible, rather than just fantasy. As a result, any attempts to travel in time prior to Thorne's development of wormhole theory results in the time traveller entering a fantastic version of reality, rather than the actual past.<ref>Larry Niven. Rainbow Mars. New York: Tor Books, 1999, pp. 45, 366.</ref>
*In the film The Theory of Everything, Thorne was portrayed by actor Enzo Cilenti.<ref></ref>

As a tool to be used in both enterprises, astrophysics and theoretical physics, Thorne and his students have developed an unusual approach, called the "membrane paradigm", to the theory of black holes and used it to clarify the "Blandford-Znajek" mechanism by which black holes may power some quasars and active galactic nuclei.<ref name="Thorne1994" />
Thorne has investigated the quantum statistical mechanics origin of the entropy of a black hole. With his postdoc Wojciech Zurek, he showed that the entropy of a black hole is the logarithm of the number of ways that the hole could have been made.<ref name="Thorne1994" />
With Igor Novikov and Don Page, he developed the general relativistic theory of thin accretion disks around black holes, and using this theory he deduced that with a doubling of its mass by such accretion a black hole will be spun up to 0.998 of the maximum spin allowed by general relativity, but not any farther. This is probably the maximum black-hole spin allowed in nature.<ref name="its.caltech.edu" />
