Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont

==Early life==
Emma was born a princess of Waldeck and Pyrmont on 2 August 1858 in Arolsen Castle in Arolsen, the capital of the small German principality of Waldeck (state). She was the fourth daughter of Georg Viktor, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont, and Princess Helena of Nassau. Her brother, Friedrich, was the last reigning prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont. Her sister, Helena, was the wife of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, a son of Queen Victoria.
Her maternal grandfather was William, Duke of Nassau, a grandson of Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau, through which she inherited a place in the line of succession to the Dutch Crown until 1887. 
Emma had a religious education from a very liberal minded pastor. With her English governess, Emma studied crafts, drawing, and French literature. Her upbringing has been described as fairly informal, though with a focuse on a sense of duty.<ref name="Redactie"/> She was given an interest for social work early on due to the charity work she became involved in already as young, and an interest for medical work due to the illness of her eldest sister, who suffered from tuberculosis. <ref name="Redactie">Redactie, Emma Wilhelmine Therese van Waldeck-Pyrmont, in: Digitaal Vrouwenlexicon van Nederland. URL: urltoken 24/03/2014 </ref> Emma was described as tactful, sensible and engaging.<ref name="Redactie"/> 
==Queen==
Princess Emma married the elderly King William III in Arolsen on 7 January 1879, two years after the death of his first wife, Sophie of Württemberg.<ref name=EdmundsonP421>George Edmundson, History of Holland (2013), p. 421</ref><ref>David Williamson, Debrett's Kings and Queens of Europe (1988), p. 101</ref>
The marriage was suggested during William's visit to Pyrmont in 1878. It was an arranged dynastic marriage and Emma agreed because of the sense of religious duty she had been raised to, in order to benefit the dynastic marriage policy of her parents.<ref name="Redactie"/> During the engagement, she wad given lessons in the Dutch language and politics.<ref name="Redactie"/> 
The king had three sons from his first marriage, William, Maurice, and Alexander, all of whom died without any legitimate offspring.<ref name=EdmundsonP421/> With William, Emma had her only child, the future Queen Wilhelmina, on 31 August 1880. When her last surviving stepson Alexander, Prince of Orange died in 1884, her daughter became heir to the throne. This changed Emma's own position, since it was likely that her daughter would succeed her spouse as a minor, in which case Emma herself would be regent during her minority. 
During these years, the king retired from public life duue to his health condition, and Emma was given the task to act as his nurse.<ref name="Redactie"/> 
==Regency==
Three days before William died on 23 November 1890, Emma became regent for her incapacitated husband. She continued her regency into the reign of his successor, their underage daughter, Wilhelmina, until Wilhelmina's eighteenth birthday on 31 August 1898. The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the crown of which according to the House-Treaty should not be inherited by a woman, passed to Adolf, Duke of Nassau, who happened to be Queen Emma's maternal uncle.
Emma was the first woman to rule The Netherlands since Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau a century before, and the first woman to rule the Kingdom of the Netherlands. She took her position of regent seriously. Her task was not simple, since William had antagonized many politicians with his autocratic ways. She managed to establish better relations between the royal house and the political world fairly quickly with good advisors, particularly Jhr J. Röell and Jhr GCJ van Reenen.<ref name="Redactie"/> She met personally with every government minister at least once every two weeks to keep herself informed of all political issues, and strictly adhered to the rules of the constitutional monarchy. She used the trust she gained by respecting the constitutional forms by using her influence within political issues she did care about, which resulted in compromises in which she often managed to get her will.<ref name="Redactie"/> One stateman commented that Emma was efficient because she combined a strong will with soft forms, something they had not been used to.<ref name="Redactie"/> 
As regent Emma presided over three cabinets. In 1891, Emma refused to appoint the suggested minister Johannes Tak van Poortvliet, with whom she had a tense relationship, in favor of G. van Tienhoven.<ref name="Redactie"/> In 1894 she was convinced by Tak van Poortvliet to dissolve Parliament.<ref name="Redactie"/> When a new cabinet was to be sworn in, she refused until she had read and aproved of their political program.<ref name="Redactie"/> In 1897, she demanded that both the Liberal parties was to be included in the new cabinet and the Aceh war was to continue, before she agreed to have the new government sworn in.<ref name="Redactie"/> She wrote and held her speeches in Dutch, and engaged herself in the Dutch Colonial Empire, attending the military parades and celebrations associated with Imperial achievments.<ref name="Redactie"/>
In addition to her administrative duties, Emma paid great attention to the education of her daughter. When Wilhelmina reached the age of 16, Emma considered her childhood over and Wilhelmina spent the next two years being prepared for her job as a reigning queen. During her government, she took Wilhelmina on tours through the provinces to visit local charities, hospitals, curches and factories and aquaint Wilhelmina with her future duties. 
==Queen mother==
On 6 September 1898 her daughter queen Wilhelmina reached legal majority and queen Emma thereby retired from regency. In her farewell speech as regent, she expressed her wish that The Netherlands should continue to be great in the way small nations could show greatness.<ref name="Redactie"/> 
Emma continued to live with her daughter until Wilhelmina's marriage to Henry of Mecklenburg in 1901, after which she moved to her own residence Lange Voorhout in The Hague. When her granddaughter Juliana was born in 1909, it was declared than in case Juliana succeeded to the throne as a minor, her grandmother Emma should be regent rather than her father.<ref name="Redactie"/>
As queen mother Emma continued to attend to public royal representational duties, supporting her daughter and son-in-law, and was a well known figure in her black widow lace. She was called "queen of charity" and expecially engaged in improvement of the conditions for those suffering from tuberculosis. 
She retired from public life when her granddaughter Juliana was declared adult and started to participate in public duties in 1927.<ref name="Redactie"/>
The queen mother died in The Hague on 20 March 1934, of complications from bronchitis at the age of 75, and was buried in Delft.
