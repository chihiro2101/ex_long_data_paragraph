White stork

=== Feeding ===
White storks consume a wide variety of animal prey. They prefer to forage in meadows that are within roughly 5&nbsp;km (3&nbsp;mi) of their nest and sites where the vegetation is shorter so that their prey is more accessible.<ref name="Johst" /> Their diet varies according to season, locality and prey availability. Common food items include insects (primarily beetles, grasshoppers, locusts and crickets), earthworms, reptiles, amphibians, particularly frog species such as the edible frog (Pelophylax kl. esculentus) and common frog (Rana temporaria) and small mammals such as voles, moles and shrews. Less commonly, they also eat bird eggs and young birds, fish, molluscs, crustaceans and scorpions. They hunt mainly during the day, swallowing small prey whole, but killing and breaking apart larger prey before swallowing. Rubber bands are mistaken for earthworms and consumed, occasionally resulting in fatal blockage of the digestive tract.<ref></ref>
Birds returning to Latvia during spring have been shown to locate their prey, moor frogs (Rana arvalis), by homing in on the mating calls produced by aggregations of male frogs.<ref></ref>
The diet of non-breeding birds is similar to that of breeding birds, but food items are more often taken from dry areas.<ref></ref> White storks wintering in western India have been observed to follow blackbuck to capture insects disturbed by them.<ref></ref> Wintering white storks in India sometimes forage along with the woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus).<ref name="Pande"></ref> Food piracy has been recorded in India with a rodent captured by a western marsh harrier appropriated by a white stork, while Montagu's harrier is known to harass white storks foraging for voles in some parts of Poland.<ref></ref><ref></ref> White storks can exploit landfill sites for food during the breeding season, migration period and winter.<ref></ref>
== Parasites and diseases ==
White stork nests are habitats for an array of small arthropods, particularly over the warmer months after the birds arrive to breed. Nesting over successive years, the storks bring more material to line their nests and layers of organic material accumulate within them. Not only do their bodies tend to regulate temperatures within the nest, but excrement, food remains and feather and skin fragments provide nourishment for a large and diverse population of free-living mesostigmata mites. A survey of twelve nests found 13,352 individuals of 34 species, the most common being Macrocheles merdarius, M.&nbsp;robustulus, Uroobovella pyriformis and Trichouropoda orbicularis, which together represented almost 85% of all the specimens collected. These feed on the eggs and larvae of insects and on nematodes, which are abundant in the nest litter. These mites are dispersed by coprophagia beetles, often of the family Scarabaeidae, or on dung brought by the storks during nest construction. Parasitic mites do not occur, perhaps being controlled by the predatory species. The overall effect of the mite population is unclear, the mites may have a role in suppressing harmful organisms (and hence be beneficial), or they may themselves have an adverse effect on nestlings.<ref name="bloszyk2005"></ref><ref name="Bajerlein"></ref>
The birds themselves host species belonging to more than four genera of feather mites.<ref name="Rothschild"></ref> These mites, including Freyanopterolichus pelargicus<ref name="TrouessartMegnin1885"></ref><ref name="MuseumCentralAfrica"></ref> The fungi found on the plumage may feed on the keratin of the outer feathers or on feather oil.<ref name="fungi"></ref> Chewing lice such as Colpocephalum zebra tend to be found on the wings, and Neophilopterus incompletus elsewhere on the body.<ref></ref>
The white stork also carries several types of internal parasites, including Toxoplasma gondii<ref></ref> and intestinal parasites of the genus Giardia.<ref></ref> A study of 120 white stork carcasses from Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg in Germany yielded eight species of trematoda (fluke), four cestoda (tapeworm) species, and at least three species of nematoda.<ref></ref> One species of fluke, Chaunocephalus ferox, caused lesions in the wall of the small intestine in a number of birds admitted to two rehabilitation centres in central Spain, and was associated with reduced weight. It is a recognised pathogen and cause of morbidity in the Asian openbill (Anastomus oscitans).<ref></ref> More recently, the thorough study performed by J. Sitko and P. Heneberg in the Czech Republic in 1962–2013 suggested that the central European white storks host 11 helminth species. Chaunocephalus ferox, Tylodelphys excavata and Dictymetra discoidea were reported to be the dominant ones. The other species found included Cathaemasia hians, Echinochasmus spinulosus, Echinostoma revolutum, Echinostoma sudanense, Duboisia syriaca, Apharyngostrigea cornu, Capillaria sp. and Dictymetra discoidea. Juvenile white storks were shown to host less species, but the intensity of infection was higher in the juveniles than in the adult storks.<ref name="Sitko & Heneberg 2015"></ref>
West Nile virus (WNV) is mainly a bird infection that is transmitted between birds by mosquitos.<ref></ref> Migrating birds appear to be important in spread of the virus,<ref></ref> the ecology of which remains poorly known.<ref name="Zeller2004"></ref> On 26 August 1998, a flock of about 1,200 migrating white storks that had been blown off course on their southward journey landed in Eilat, in southern Israel. The flock was stressed as it had resorted to flapping flight to return to its migratory route, and a number of birds died. A virulent strain of West Nile virus was isolated from the brains of eleven dead juveniles. Other white storks subsequently tested in Israel have shown anti-WNV antibody.<ref></ref> In 2008 three juvenile white storks from a Polish wildlife refuge yielded Serostatus results indicating exposure to the virus, but the context or existence of the virus in Poland is unclear.<ref></ref>
== Conservation ==
s in Africa, and largely illegal hunting on migration routes and wintering grounds.
A large population of white storks breeds in central (Poland, Ukraine and Germany) and southern Europe (Spain and Turkey). In a 2004/05 census, there were 52,500 pairs in Poland, 30,000 pairs in Ukraine, 20,000 pairs in Belarus, 13,000 pairs in Lithuania (the highest known density of this species in the world), 10,700 pairs in Latvia, and 10,200 in Russia. There were around 5,500 pairs in Romania, 5,300 in Hungary and an estimated 4,956 breeding pairs in Bulgaria.<ref name="nabu"></ref> In Germany, the majority of the total 4,482 pairs were in the eastern region, especially in the states of Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (1296 and 863 pairs in 2008 respectively).<ref></ref> Apart from Spain and Portugal (33,217 and 7,684 pairs in 2004/05 respectively), populations are generally much less stable. The Danish population declined to just three pairs in 2005. In the eastern Mediterranean region Turkey has a sizeable population of 6,195 pairs, and Greece 2,139 pairs. In Western Europe the white stork remains a rare bird despite conservation efforts. In 2004 France had only 973 pairs, and the Netherlands 528 pairs.<ref name="nabu" /> In Armenia the population of the white stork slightly increased in the period between 2005 and 2015, and by last data reached 652 pairs.<ref>Aghababyan K. 2011.

In the early 1980s, the population had fallen to fewer than nine pairs in the entire upper Rhine River valley, an area closely identified with the white stork for centuries. Conservation efforts successfully increased the population of birds there to 270 pairs (in 2008), largely due to the actions of the Association for the Protection and Reintroduction of Storks in Alsace and Lorraine.<ref></ref> The reintroduction of zoo-reared birds has halted further declines in Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. There were 601 pairs breeding in Armenia and around 700 pairs in the Netherlands in 2008,<ref name="Vogelbescherming"></ref> and few pairs also breed in South Africa, typically recent colonists from within the normal wintering population. In Poland, electric poles have been modified with a platform at the top to prevent the white stork's large nest from disrupting the electricity supply, and sometimes nests are moved from an electric pole to a man-made platform.<ref name="AZ-2009"></ref> Introductions of zoo-reared birds in the Netherlands has been followed up by feeding and nest-building programs by volunteers.<ref name="Vogelbescherming" /> Similar reintroduction programs are taking place in Sweden,<ref></ref> and Switzerland,<ref name="Moritzi"></ref> where 175 pairs were recorded breeding in 2000.<ref></ref> Long-term viability of the population in Switzerland is unclear as breeding success rates are low, and supplementary feeding does not appear to be of benefit.<ref name="Moritzi" /> However, as of 2017, 470 adults and 757 young ones were recorded in Switzerland.<ref></ref>
In August 2019, 24 juveniles were released at the Knepp Estate in West Sussex, and others at a site near Tunbridge Wells and at the Wintershall Estate, near Godalming, as part of a project to reintroduce the white stork as a breeding species in South East England,<ref name="BG-2019"></ref> for the first time since 1416.<ref></ref> In 2020, the program was successful with the birth of five baby storks.<ref name="CNN2020" />
== Cultural associations ==
Due to its large size, predation on vermin, and nesting behaviour close to human settlements and on rooftops, the white stork has an imposing presence that has influenced human culture and folklore.<ref name="Cocker" /> The Hebrew word for the white stork is chasidah (חסידה), meaning "merciful" or "kind".<ref name="Margolis72"></ref> Greek and Roman mythology portray storks as models of parental devotion. The 3rd century Roman writer Aelian citing the authority of Alexander of Myndus noted in his De natura animalium (book 3, chapter 23) that aged storks flew away to oceanic islands where they were transformed into humans as a reward for their piety towards their parents.<ref></ref> The bird is featured in at least three of Aesop's Fables: The Fox and the Stork, The Farmer and the Stork, and The Frogs Who Desired a King. Storks were also thought to care for their aged parents, feeding them and even transporting them, and children's books depicted them as a model of filial values. A Greek law called Pelargonia, from the Ancient Greek word pelargos for stork, required citizens to take care of their aged parents. The Greeks also held that killing a stork could be punished with death.<ref></ref> Storks were allegedly protected in Ancient Thessaly as they hunted snakes, and widely held to be Virgil's "white bird".<ref name="Royds14"></ref> Roman writers noted the white stork's arrival in spring, which alerted farmers to plant their vines.<ref></ref>
Followers of Islam revered storks because they made an annual pilgrimage to Mecca on their migration.<ref name="sax" /> Some of the earliest understanding on bird migration were initiated by an interest in white storks; Pfeilstorch ("arrow storks") were found in Europe with African arrows embedded in their bodies. A well-known example of such a stork found in the summer of 1822 in the German town of Klütz in Mecklenburg was made into a mounted taxidermy specimen, complete with the ornate African arrow, that is now in the University of Rostock.<ref name="arrow"></ref>
Storks have little fear of humans if not disturbed, and often nest on buildings in Europe. In Germany, the presence of a nest on a house was believed to protect against fires. They were also protected because of the belief that their souls were human.<ref></ref> German, Dutch and Polish households would encourage storks to nest on houses, sometimes by constructing purpose-built high platforms, to bring good luck.<ref name="Margolis72" /> Across much of Central and Eastern Europe it is believed that storks bring harmony to a family on whose property they nest.<ref name="Encyclopaedia of Ukraine"></ref>
The white stork is a popular motif on postage stamps, and it is featured on more than 120 stamps issued by more than 60 stamp-issuing entities.<ref name="Birdtheme"></ref> It is the national bird of Lithuania, Belarus<ref name="Lithuania"></ref> and Poland, and it was a Polish mascot at the Expo 2000 Fair in Hanover.<ref name="paiiz"></ref> Storks nesting in Polish villages such as Żywkowo have made them tourist attractions, drawing 2000–5000 visitors a year in 2014.<ref></ref> In the 19th century, storks were also thought to only live in countries having a republican form of government.<ref></ref> Polish poet Cyprian Kamil Norwid mentioned storks in his poem Moja piosnka (II) ("My Song (II)"):<ref></ref>
In 1942 Heinrich Himmler sought to use storks to carry Nazi propaganda leaflets so as to win support from the Boers in South Africa. The idea for this "Storchbein-Propaganda" plan was a secret that was transmitted by Walter Schellenberg to be examined by the German ornithologist Ernst Schüz at the Rossiten bird observatory, who pointed out that the probability of finding marked storks in Africa was less than one percent, requiring a 1000 birds to transmit 10 leaflets successfully. The plan was then dropped.<ref></ref>
=== Storks and delivery of babies===
According to European folklore, the stork is responsible for bringing babies to new parents. The legend is very ancient, but was popularised by a 19th-century Hans Christian Andersen story called "The Storks".<ref name="sax"></ref> German folklore held that storks found babies in caves or marshes and brought them to households in a basket on their backs or held in their beaks. These caves contained adebarsteine or "stork stones". The babies would then be given to the mother or dropped down the chimney. Households would notify when they wanted children by placing sweets for the stork on the window sill.<ref name="Margolis72" /> From there the folklore has spread around the world to the Philippines and countries in South America.<ref name="Margolis72" /> Birthmarks on the back of the head of newborn baby, nevus flammeus nuchae, are sometimes referred to as stork-bite.<ref></ref>
In Slavic mythology, storks were thought to carry unborn souls from Vyraj to Earth in spring and summer.<ref></ref> This belief still persists in the modern folk culture of many Slavic countries, in the simplified child story that "storks bring children into the world".<ref></ref> Storks were seen by Early Slavs as bringing luck, and killing one would bring misfortune.<ref name="autonazwa1"></ref> A long-term study that showed a spurious correlation between the numbers of stork nests and human births is widely used in the teaching of basic statistics as an example to highlight that correlation does not necessarily indicate Causality.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The child-bringing myth has appeared in different forms in history. Children of African American slaves were sometimes told that white babies were brought by storks, while black babies were born from buzzard eggs.<ref></ref>
Psychoanalyst Marvin Margolis suggests the enduring nature of the stork fable of the newborn is linked to its addressing a psychological need, in that it allays the discomfort of discussing sex and procreation with children. Birds have long been associated with the maternal symbols from pagan goddesses such as Juno to the Holy Ghost, and the stork may have been chosen for its white plumage (depicting purity), size (in that it is big enough to carry an infant), and flight at high altitude (likened to flying between Earth and Heaven).<ref name="Margolis72" /> The fable and its relation to the internal world of the child have been discussed by Sigmund Freud<ref name="Margolis72" /> and Carl Jung.<ref name="Jung10"></ref> In fact, Jung recalled being told the story himself upon the birth of his own sister.<ref name="Pickles11"></ref> The traditional link with the newborn continues with their use in advertising for such products as diaper and baby announcements.<ref name="Margolis72" />
There were negative aspects to stork folklore as well; a Polish folk tale relates how God made the stork's plumage white, while the Devil gave it black wings, imbuing it with both good and evil impulses. They were also associated with handicapped or stillborn babies in Germany, explained as the stork having dropped the baby en route to the household, or as revenge or punishment for past wrongdoing. A mother who was confined to bed around the time of childbirth was said to have been "bitten" by the stork.<ref name="Margolis72" /> In Denmark, storks were said to toss a nestling off the nest and then an egg in successive years.<ref name="Margolis72" /> In medieval England, storks were also associated with adultery, possibly inspired by their courtship rituals. Their preening and posture saw them linked with the attribute of self-conceit.<ref name="deVries76"></ref>

== Notes ==

</ref> Paired birds greet by engaging in up-down and head-shaking crouch displays, and clattering the beak while throwing back the head. Pairs copulate frequently throughout the month before eggs are laid. High-frequency pair copulation is usually associated with sperm competition and high frequency of extra-pair copulation; however, extra-pair copulation is infrequent in white storks.<ref></ref>
A white stork pair raises a single brood a year. The female typically lays four eggs, though clutches of one to seven have been recorded. The eggs are white, but often look dirty or yellowish due to a glutinous covering. They typically measure ,<ref name="Oologia neerlandica" /> and weigh , of which about is shell.<ref name="Oologia neerlandica"></ref> Incubation begins as soon as the first egg is laid, so the brood hatches asynchronously, beginning 33 to 34&nbsp;days later. The first hatchling typically has a competitive edge over the others. While stronger chicks are not aggressive towards weaker siblings, as is the case in some species, weak or small chicks are sometimes killed by their parents.<ref name="Zielinski"></ref><ref></ref> This behaviour occurs in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. White stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. Despite this, this behaviour has not commonly been observed.<ref name="Zielinski" />
The temperature and weather around the time of hatching in spring is important; cool temperatures and wet weather increase chick mortality and reduce breeding success rates.<ref name="Carrascal1993" /> Somewhat unexpectedly, studies have found that later-hatching chicks which successfully reach adulthood produce more chicks than do their earlier-hatching nestmates.<ref></ref> The body weight of the chicks increases rapidly in the first few weeks and reaches a plateau of about in 45&nbsp;days. The length of the beak increases linearly for about 50&nbsp;days.<ref></ref> Young birds are fed with earthworms and insects, which are regurgitated by the parents onto the floor of the nest. Older chicks reach into the mouths of parents to obtain food.<ref></ref> Chicks fledge 58 to 64&nbsp;days after hatching.
White storks generally begin breeding when about four years old, although the age of first breeding has been recorded as early as two years and as late as seven years. The oldest known wild white stork lived for 39 years after being ringed in Switzerland,<ref></ref> while captive birds have lived for more than 35 years.
