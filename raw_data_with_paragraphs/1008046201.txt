Optical telegraph

==Etymology and terminology==
The word semaphore was coined in 1801 by the French inventor of the semaphore line itself, Claude Chappe.<ref>Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions & Discoveries of the 18th Century, Jonathan Shectman, p. 172</ref> He composed it from the Greek elements σῆμα (sêma, "sign"); and from φορός (phorós, "carrying"),<ref>Oxford English Dictionary.</ref> or φορά (phorá, "a carrying") from φέρειν (phérein, "to bear").<ref>Webster's Unabridged Dictionary.</ref> Chappe also coined the word tachygraph, meaning "fast writer".<ref>Beyer, Rick, The Greatest Stories Never Told, A&E Television Networks / The History Channel, , p. 60</ref> However, the French Army preferred to call Chappe's semaphore system the telegraph, meaning "far writer", which was coined by French statesman André François Miot de Mélito.<ref>Le Robert historique de la langue française, 1992, 1998</ref> The word semaphoric was first printed in English in 1808: "The newly constructed Semaphoric telegraphs", referring to the destruction of telegraphs in France.<ref>500 Years of New Words, Bill Sherk</ref> The first use of the word semaphore in reference to English use was in 1816: "The improved Semaphore has been erected on the top of the Admiralty", referring to the installation of a simpler telegraph invented by Sir Home Popham. Semaphore telegraphs are also called, "Chappe telegraphs" or "Napoleonic semaphore".
==Early designs==
Optical telegraphy dates from ancient times, in the form of hydraulic telegraphs, torches (as used by ancient cultures since the discovery of fire) and smoke signals. Modern design of semaphores was first foreseen by the British polymath Robert Hooke, who gave a vivid and comprehensive outline of visual telegraphy to the Royal Society in a 1684 submission in which he outlined many practical details. The system (which was motivated by military concerns, following the Battle of Vienna in 1683) was never put into practice.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
One of the first experiments of optical signalling was carried out by the Anglo-Irish landowner and inventor, Sir Richard Lovell Edgeworth in 1767.<ref></ref> He placed a bet with his friend, the horse racing gambler Lord March, that he could transmit knowledge of the outcome of the race in just one hour. Using a network of signalling sections erected on high ground, the signal would be observed from one station to the next by means of a telescope. The signal itself consisted of a large pointer that could be placed into eight possible positions in 45 degree increments. A series of two such signals gave a total 64 code elements and a third signal took it up to 512. He returned to his idea in 1795, after hearing of Chappe's system.
==France==
Credit for the first successful optical telegraph goes to the French engineer Claude Chappe and his brothers in 1792, who succeeded in covering France with a network of 556 stations stretching a total distance of . Le système Chappe was used for military and national communications until the 1850s.
===Development in France===
During 1790–1795, at the height of the French Revolution, France needed a swift and reliable military communications system to thwart the war efforts of its enemies. France was surrounded by the forces of Britain, the Netherlands, Prussia, Austria, and Spain, the cities of Marseille and Lyon were in revolt, and the British Fleet held Toulon. The only advantage France held was the lack of cooperation between the allied forces due to their inadequate lines of communication. In mid-1790, the Chappe brothers set about devising a system of communication that would allow the central government to receive intelligence and to transmit orders in the shortest possible time. Chappe considered many possible methods including audio and smoke. He even considered using electricity, but could not find insulation for the conductors that would withstand the high-voltage electrostatic sources available at the time.<ref>Patrice Flichy, Dynamics of Modern Communication, p. 33, SAGE, 1995 </ref><ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 53</ref>
Chappe settled on an optical system and the first public demonstration occurred on 2 March 1791 between Brûlon and Parcé, a distance of . The system consisted of a modified pendulum clock at each end with dials marked with ten numerals. The hands of the clocks almost certainly moved much faster than a normal clock. The hands of both clocks were set in motion at the same time with a synchronisation signal. Further signals indicated the time at which the dial should be read. The numbers sent were then looked up in a codebook. In their preliminary experiments over a shorter distance, the Chappes had banged a pan for synchronisation. In the demonstration, they used black and white panels observed with a telescope. The message to be sent was chosen by town officials at Brûlon and sent by René Chappe to Claude Chappe at Parcé who had no pre-knowledge of the message. The message read "si vous réussissez, vous serez bientôt couverts de gloire" (If you succeed, you will soon bask in glory). It was only later that Chappe realised that he could dispense with the clocks and the synchronisation system itself could be used to pass messages.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, pp. 53–55</ref>
The Chappes carried out experiments during the next two years, and on two occasions their apparatus at Place de l'Étoile, Paris was destroyed by mobs who thought they were communicating with royalist forces. Their cause was assisted by Ignace Chappe being elected to the Legislative Assembly. In the summer of 1792 Claude was appointed Ingénieur-Télégraphiste and charged with establishing a line of stations between Paris and Lille, a distance of 230 kilometres (about 143 miles). It was used to carry dispatches for the war between France and Austria. In 1794, it brought news of a French capture of Condé-sur-l'Escaut from the Austrians less than an hour after it occurred.<ref> urltoken How Napoleon's semaphore telegraph changed the world, BBC News, Hugh Schofield, 16 June 2013</ref> The first symbol of a message to Lille would pass through 15 stations in only nine minutes. The speed of the line varied with the weather, but the line to Lille typically transferred 36 symbols, a complete message, in about 32 minutes. Another line of 50 stations was completed in 1798, covering 488&nbsp;km between Paris and Strasbourg.<ref> urltoken From 1803 on, the French also used the 3-arm Depillon semaphore at coastal locations to provide warning of British incursions.<ref name="Burns2004"/>
===Chappe system technical operation===
The Chappe brothers determined by experiment that it was easier to see the angle of a rod than to see the presence or absence of a panel. Their semaphore was composed of two black movable wooden arms, connected by a cross bar; the positions of all three of these components together indicated an alphabetic letter. With counterweights (named forks) on the arms, the Chappe system was controlled by only two handles and was mechanically simple and reasonably robust. Each of the two 2-metre-long arms could display seven positions, and the 4.6-metre-long cross bar connecting the two arms could display four different angles, for a total of 196 symbols (7×7×4). Night operation with lamps on the arms was unsuccessful.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 213</ref> To speed up transmission and to provide some semblance of security, a code book was developed for use with semaphore lines. The Chappes' corporation used a code that took 92 of the basic symbols two at a time to yield 8,464 coded words and phrases.
The revised Chappe system of 1795 provided not only a set of codes but also an operational protocol intended to maximize line throughput. Symbols were transmitted in cycles of "2 steps and 3 movements."
* Step 1, movement 1 (setup): The operator turned the indicator arms to align with the cross bar, forming a non-symbol, and then turned the cross bar into position for the next symbol.
* Step 1, movement 2 (transmission): The operator positioned the indicator arms for current symbol and waited for the downline station to copy it.
* Step 2, movement 3 (completion): The operator turned the cross bar to a vertical or horizontal position, indicating the end of a cycle.
In this manner, each symbol could propagate down the line as quickly as operators could successfully copy it, with acknowledgement and flow control built into the protocol. A symbol sent from Paris took 2 minutes to reach Lille through 22 stations and 9 minutes to reach Lyon through 50 stations. A rate of 2–3 symbols per minute was typical, with the higher figure being prone to errors. This corresponds to only 0.4–0.6 wpm, but with messages limited to those contained in the code book, this could be dramatically increased.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson</ref><ref> urltoken 
===History===
After Chappe's initial line (between Paris and Lille), the Paris to Strasbourg with 50 stations followed soon after (1798). Napoleon Bonaparte made full use of the telegraph by obtaining speedy information on enemy movements. In 1801 he had Abraham Chappe build an extra-large station to transmit across the English Channel in preparation for an invasion of Britain. A pair of such stations were built on a test line over a comparable distance. The line to Calais was extended to Boulogne in anticipation and a new design station was briefly in operation at Boulogne, but the invasion never happened. In 1812, Napoleon took up another design of Abraham Chappe for a mobile telegraph that could be taken with him on campaign. This was still in use in 1853 during the Crimean War.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, pp. 71–73</ref>
The invention of the telegraph was followed by an enthusiasm concerning its potential to support direct democracy. For instance, based on Rousseau's argument that direct democracy was improbable in large constituencies, the French Intellectual Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde commented:

In Ireland, Richard Lovell Edgeworth returned to his earlier work in 1794, and proposed a telegraph there to warn against an anticipated French invasion; however, the proposal was not implemented. Lord George Murray, stimulated by reports of the Chappe semaphore, proposed a system of visual telegraphy to the British Admiralty in 1795.<ref name="EdEnc1832"/> He employed rectangular framework towers with six five-foot-high octagonal shutters on horizontal axes that flipped between horizontal and vertical positions to signal.<ref name="Mech1828"> urltoken Lieutenant Watson's Telegraph Mechanics' magazine, Volume 8 No. 222, Knight and Lacey, 1828, pages 294-299</ref> The Rev. Mr Gamble also proposed two distinct five-element systems in 1795: one using five shutters, and one using five ten-foot poles.<ref name="EdEnc1832"/> The British Admiralty accepted Murray's system in September 1795, and the first system was the 15 site chain from London to Deal.<ref name="Wrixon2005">F.B. Wrixon (2005), Codes, Ciphers, Secrets and Cryptic Communication pp. 444-445 cover Murray's shutter telegraph in the U.K., with codes.</ref> Messages passed from London to Deal in about sixty seconds, and sixty-five sites were in use by 1808.<ref name="Wrixon2005"/>
Chains of Murray's shutter telegraph stations were built along the following routes: London–Deal and Sheerness, London–Great Yarmouth, and London–Portsmouth and Plymouth.<ref name=OT/> The line to Plymouth was not completed until 4 July 1806, and so could not be used to relay the news of Trafalgar. The shutter stations were temporary wooden huts, and at the conclusion of the Napoleonic wars they were no longer necessary, and were closed down by the Admiralty in March 1816.<ref name="MSSC">Military Signals from the South Coast, John Goodwin, 2000</ref>
Following the Battle of Trafalgar, the news was transmitted to London by frigate to Falmouth, from where the captain took the dispatches to London by coach along what became known as the Trafalgar Way; the journey took 38 hours. This delay prompted the Admiralty to investigate further.
A replacement semaphore system was sought, and of the many ideas and devices put forward the Admiralty chose the simpler semaphore system invented by Sir Home Popham.<ref name="EncyBrit1824"/><ref name="EdEnc1832"/> A Popham semaphore was a single fixed vertical 30 foot pole, with two movable 8 foot arms attached to the pole by horizontal pivots at their ends, one arm at the top of the pole, and the other arm at the middle of the pole.<ref name="Burns2004"/><ref name="EncyBrit1824"/> The signals of the Popham semaphore were found to be much more visible than those of the Murray shutter telegraph.<ref name="Burns2004"/> Popham's 2-arm semaphore was modeled after the 3-arm Depillon French semaphore.<ref name="Burns2004"/> An experimental semaphore line between the Admiralty and Chatham was installed in July 1816, and its success helped to confirm the choice.<ref name="MSSC"/>
Subsequently, the Admiralty decided to establish a permanent link to Portsmouth and built a chain of semaphore stations. Work started in December 1820<ref name="MSSC"/> with Popham's equipment replaced with another two-arm system invented by Charles Pasley. Each of the arms of Pasley's system could take on one of eight positions and it thus had more codepoints than Popham's.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 196</ref> In good conditions messages were sent from London to Portsmouth in less than eight minutes.<ref>C. I. Hamilton, The Making of the Modern Admiralty: British Naval Policy-Making, 1805–1927, p. 92, Cambridge University Press, 2011 .</ref> The line was operational from 1822 until 1847, when the railway and electric telegraph provided a better means of communication. The semaphore line did not use the same locations as the shutter chain, but followed almost the same route with 15 stations: Admiralty (London), Chelsea Royal Hospital, Putney Heath, Coombe Warren, Claygate, Chatley Heath, Pewley Hill, Witley, Haste Hill (Haslemere), Woolbeding, Harting, Compton Down, Camp Down, Lumps Fort (Southsea), and HMNB Portsmouth. The semaphore tower at Chatley Heath, which replaced the Netley Heath station of the shutter telegraph, is currently being restored by the Landmark Trust as self-catering holiday accommodation.<ref></ref> There will be public access on certain days when the restoration is complete.<ref></ref>
The Board of the Port of Liverpool obtained a Private Act of Parliament to construct a chain of Popham optical semaphore stations from Liverpool to Holyhead in 1825.<ref>Faster Than The Wind, The Liverpool to Holyhead Telegraph, Frank Large, an avid publication </ref> The system was designed and part-owned by Barnard L. Watson, a reserve marine officer, and came into service in 1827. The line is possibly the only example of an optical telegraph built entirely for commercial purposes. It was used so that observers at Holyhead could report incoming ships to the Port of Liverpool and trading could begin in the cargo being carried before the ship docked. The line was kept in operation until 1860 when a railway line and associated electrical telegraph made it redundant.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 197</ref><ref>Seija-Riitta Laakso, Across the Oceans: Development of Overseas Business Information Transmission 1815-1875, BoD - Books on Demand, 2018 </ref> Many of the prominences on which the towers were built ('telegraph hills') are known as Telegraph Hill to this day.

In Ireland R.L. Edgeworth was to develop an optical telegraph based on a triangle pointer, measuring up to 16 feet in height. Following several years promoting his system, he was to get admiralty approval and engaged in its construction during 1803–1804. The completed system ran from Dublin to Galway and was to act as a rapid warning system in case of French invasion of the west coast of Ireland. Despite its success in operation, the receding threat of French invasion was to see the system disestablished in 1804.<ref>Adrian James Kirwan, 'R.L. Edgeworth and Optical Telegraphy in Ireland, c. 1790-1805' in Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy (2017). urltoken 
In Canada, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent established the first semaphore line in North America. In operation by 1800, it ran between the city of Halifax and the town of Annapolis in Nova Scotia, and across the Bay of Fundy to Saint John and Fredericton in New Brunswick. In addition to providing information on approaching ships, the Duke used the system to relay military commands, especially as they related to troop discipline. The Duke had envisioned the line reaching as far as the British garrison at Quebec City, but the many hills and coastal fog meant the towers needed to be placed relatively close together to ensure visibility. The labour needed to build and continually man so many stations taxed the already stretched-thin British military and there is doubt the New Brunswick line was ever in operation. With the exception of the towers around Halifax harbour, the system was abandoned shortly after the Duke's departure in August 1800.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
The British military authorities began to consider installing a semaphore line in Malta in the early 1840s. Initially, it was planned that semaphore stations be established on the bell towers and domes of the island's churches, but the religious authorities rejected the proposal. Due to this, in 1848 new semaphore towers were constructed at Għargħur and Għaxaq on the main island, and another was built at Ta' Kenuna on Gozo. Further stations were established at the Governor's Palace, Selmun Palace and the Giordan Lighthouse. Each station was manned by the Royal Engineers.<ref></ref>
In India, semaphore towers were introduced in 1810. A series of towers were built between Fort William, Kolkata to Chunar Fort near Varanasi.The towers in the plains were tall and those in the hills were tall, and were built at an interval of about .<ref></ref>

In Portugal, the British forces fighting Peninsular War soon found that the Portuguese Army had already a very capable semaphore terrestrial system working since 1806, giving the Duke of Wellington a decisive advantage in intelligence. The innovative Portuguese telegraphs, designed by Francisco Ciera, a mathematician, were of 3 types: 3 shutters, 3 balls and 1 pointer/moveable arm (the first for longer distances, the other two for short) and with the advantage of all having only 6 significant positions. He also wrote the code book "Táboas Telegráphicas", with 1554 entries from 1 to 6666 (1 to 6, 11 to 16,. 61 to 66, 111 to 116,. etc.), the same for the 3 systems. Since early 1810 the network was operated by "Corpo Telegráfico", the first Portuguese military Signal Corps.
In Spain, the engineer Agustín de Betancourt developed his own system which was adopted by that state; in 1798 he received a Royal Appointment,<ref></ref> and the first stretch of line connecting Madrid and Aranjuez was in operation as of August 1800.<ref></ref> Spain was spanned by an extensive semaphore telegraph network in the 1840s and 1850s.<ref name="Roig"></ref> The three main semaphore lines radiated from Madrid.<ref name="Roig" /><ref name="Telegrafos2014"></ref> The first ran north to Irun on the Atlantic coast at the French border.

The rugged topography of the Iberian peninsula that facilitated the design of semaphore lines conveying information from hilltop to hilltop, made it difficult to implement wire telegraph lines when that technology was introduced in the mid 19th century. The Madrid-Cadiz line was the first to be dismantled in 1855, but other segments of the optical system continued to function until the end of the Carlist Wars in 1876.<ref>Aguilar Pérez, Antonio; y Martínez Lorente, Gaspar, La telegrafía óptica en Cataluña, Scripta Nova, revista electrónica de Geografía y Ciencias Sociales.Vol. VII, núm. 137, 15 de marzo de 2003.

Once it had proved its success in France, the optical telegraph was imitated in many other countries, especially after it was used by Napoleon to coordinate his empire and army. In most of these countries, the post office operated the semaphore lines. Many national services adopted signalling systems different from the Chappe system. For example, the UK and Sweden adopted systems of shuttered panels (in contradiction to the Chappe brothers' contention that angled rods are more visible). In some cases, new systems were adopted because they were thought to be improvements. But many countries pursued their own, often inferior, designs for reasons of national pride or not wanting to copy from rivals and enemies.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, pp. 179–180</ref>
In 1801, the Danish post office installed a semaphore line across the Great Belt strait, Storebæltstelegrafen, between islands Funen and Zealand with stations at Nyborg on Funen, on the small island Sprogø in the middle of the strait, and at Korsør on Zealand. It was in use until 1865.<ref> urltoken The Age of Invention 1849–1920 , Post & Tele Museum Danmark, website visited on May 8, 2010.</ref>
In the Kingdom of Prussia, Frederick William III ordered the construction of an experimental line in 1819, but due to the procrastination of defence minister Karl von Hake, nothing happened until 1830 when a short three-station line between Berlin and Potsdam was built. The design was based on the Swedish telegraph with the number of shutters increased to twelve.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, pp. 184–185</ref> Postrat Carl Pistor proposed instead a semaphore system based on Watson's design in England. An operational line of this design running Berlin-Magdeburg-Dortmund-Köln-Bonn-Koblenz was completed in 1833. The line employed about 200 people, comparable to Sweden, but no network ever developed and no more official lines were built. The line was decommissioned in 1849 in favour of an electrical line.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, pp. 185–187</ref>
Although there were no more government sponsored official lines, there was some private enterprise. Johann Ludwig Schmidt opened a commercial line from Hamburg to Cuxhaven in 1837. In 1847, Schmidt opened a second line from Bremen to Bremerhaven. These lines were used for reporting the arrival of commercial ships. The two lines were later linked with three additional stations to create possibly the only private telegraph network in the optical telegraph era.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 186</ref> The telegraph inspector for this network was Friedrich Clemens Gerke, who would later move to the Hamburg-Cuxhaven electrical telegraph line and develop what became the International Morse Code.<ref>Huurdeman, p. 76</ref> The Hamburg line went out of use in 1850, and the Bremen line in 1852.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 187</ref>
In Russia, Tsar Nicolas I inaugurated a line between Moscow and Warsaw of length in 1833; it needed 220 stations manned by 1,320 operators. The stations were noted to be unused and decaying in 1859, so the line was probably abandoned long before this.<ref name="Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 180"/>
In the United States, the first optical telegraph was built by Jonathan Grout in 1804 but ceased operation in 1807. This line between Martha's Vineyard with Boston transmitted shipping news. An optical telegraph system linking Philadelphia and the mouth of the Delaware Bay was in place by 1809 and had a similar purpose; a second line to New York City was operational by 1834, when its Philadelphia terminus was moved to the tower of the Merchants Exchange. One of the principal hills in San Francisco, California is also named "Telegraph Hill", after the semaphore telegraph which was established there in 1849 to signal the arrival of ships into San Francisco Bay.
==First data networks==
The optical telegraphs put in place at the turn of the 18th/19th centuries were the first examples of data networks.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 214</ref> Chappe and Edelcrantz independently invented many features that are now commonplace in modern networks, but were then revolutionary and essential to the smooth running of the systems. These features included control characters, routing, error control, flow control, message priority and symbol rate. Edelcrantz documented the meaning and usage of all his control codes from the start in 1794. The details of the early Chappe system are not known precisely; the first operating instructions to survive date to 1809 and the French system is not as fully explained as the Swedish.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, pp. 210–216</ref>
Some of the features of these systems are considered advanced in modern practice and have been recently reinvented. An example of this is the error control codepoint 707 in the Edelcrantz code. This was used to request the repeat of a specified recent symbol. The 707 was followed by two symbols identifying the row and column in the current page of the logbook that it was required to repeat. This is an example of a selective repeat and is more efficient than the simple go back n strategy used on many modern networks.<ref name="Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 216">Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 216</ref> This was a later addition; both Edelcrantz (codepoint 272), and Chappe (codepoint 2H6)<ref group=note>The notation here follows that given in Holzmann & Pehrson (p. 211). The two digits represent, respectively the angle of the left and right indicators. Vertical pointing up is "1" and each successive 45° from this position increments this number. "H" means the regulator is in the horizontal position and "V" the vertical.</ref> initially used only a simple "erase last character" for error control, taken directly from Hooke's 1684 proposal.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, pp. 214–215</ref>
Routing in the French system was almost permanently fixed; only Paris and the station at the remote end of a line were allowed to initiate a message. The early Swedish system was more flexible, having the ability to set up message connections between arbitrary stations. Similar to modern networks, the initialisation request contained the identification of the requesting and target station. The request was acknowledged by the target station by sending the complement of the code received. This protocol is unique with no modern equivalent.<ref name="Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 216"/> This facility was removed from the codebook in the revision of 1808. After this, only Stockholm would normally initiate messages with other stations waiting to be polled.<ref name="Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 216"/>
The Prussian system required the Coblenz station (at the end of the line) to send a "no news" message (or a real message if there was one pending) back to Berlin on the hour, every hour. Intermediate stations could only pass messages by replacing the "no news" message with their traffic. On arrival in Berlin, the "no news" message was returned to Coblenz with the same procedure. This can be considered an early example of a token passing system. This arrangement required accurate clock synchronisation at all the stations. A synchronisation signal was sent out from Berlin for this purpose every three days.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 188</ref>
 
Another feature that would be considered advanced in a modern electronic system is the dynamic changing of transmission rates. Edelcrantz had codepoints for faster (770) and slower (077). Chappe also had this feature.
==In popular culture==
By the mid-19th century, the optical telegraph was well known enough to be referenced in popular works without special explanation. The Chappe telegraph appeared in contemporary fiction and comic strips. In "Mister Pencil" (1831), comic strip by Rodolphe Töpffer, a dog fallen on a Chappe telegraph's arm—and its master attempting to help get it down—provoke an international crisis by inadvertently transmitting disturbing messages. In "Lucien Leuwen" (1834), Stendhal pictures a power struggle between Lucien Leuwen and the prefect M. de Séranville with the telegraph's director M. Lamorte. In Chapter 60 ("The Telegraph") of Alexandre Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo (1844), the title character describes with fascination the semaphore line's moving arms: "I had at times seen rise at the end of a road, on a hillock and in the bright light of the sun, these black folding arms looking like the legs of an immense beetle."<ref> urltoken Page 84 in LE COMTE DE MONTE-CRISTO Tome III</ref> He later bribes a semaphore operator to relay a false message in order to manipulate the French financial market. Dumas also describes in details the functioning of a Chappe telegraph line. In Hector Malot's novel Romain Kalbris (1869), one of the characters, a girl named Dielette, describes her home in Paris as ".next to a church near which there was a clock tower. On top of the tower there were two large black arms, moving all day this way and that. I was told later that this was Saint-Eustache church and that these large black arms were a telegraph."<ref> urltoken See second paragraph in</ref>
A fictional optical telegraph network forms a key part of the plot of the Terry Pratchett novels The Fifth Elephant, and especially Going Postal, where a telegraph system, known as "the Clacks" and operated by the "Grand Trunk Company", stretches across the Discworld. Brief appearances are made in many of Pratchett's later novels. The "Clacks" are described as being similar to real-life Murray six-shutter telegraphs, although they are referred to as semaphore towers, and Pratchett's novels, in particular Night Watch, also describe manual semaphore being in use within the city Watch, with the watch interacting with the semaphore towers. Pratchett uses the Clacks to introduce a number of jokes and references to the Internet, including referring to letters sent via Clacks as "c-mail" and describing groups of saboteurs as "crackers".

An optical telegraph is a semaphore system using a line of stations, typically towers, for the purpose of conveying textual information by means of visual signals. There are two main types of such systems; the semaphore telegraph which uses pivoted indicator arms and conveys information according to the direction the indicators point, and the shutter telegraph which uses panels that can be rotated to block or pass the light from the sky behind to convey information.
The most widely used system was invented in 1792 in France by Claude Chappe, and was popular in the late eighteenth to early nineteenth centuries.<ref name="Burns2004"></ref><ref name="EncyBrit1824"></ref><ref name="EdEnc1832"></ref> This system is often referred to as semaphore without qualification. Lines of relay towers with a semaphore rig at the top were built within line of sight of each other, at separations of . Operators at each tower would watch the neighboring tower through a telescope, and when the semaphore arms began to move spelling out a message, they would pass the message on to the next tower. This system was much faster than post riders for conveying a message over long distances, and also had cheaper long-term operating costs, once constructed. Half a century later, semaphore lines were replaced by the electrical telegraph, which was cheaper, faster, and more private. The line-of-sight distance between relay stations was limited by geography and weather, and prevented the optical telegraph from crossing wide expanses of water, unless a convenient island could be used for a relay station. A modern derivative of the semaphore system is flag semaphore, signalling with hand-held flags.
