Venusaur

==Concept and characteristics==
Venusaur was one of 151 different designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by Ken Sugimori for the first generation of the Pokémon games Red and Green, which were localized outside Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Despite its English name and resemblance to the extinct Pareiasaur, its design was confirmed by Ken Sugimori to be based on a frog.<ref></ref> Venusaur was originally named "Fushigibana" in Japanese, which is a combination of the words fushigi and hana, which mean mystery and flower, respectively. Unlike its pre-evolutions, there is a difference between male and female Venusaur. The female has a seed in the center of its flower, while the male lacks it. Nintendo decided to give the various Pokémon species "clever and descriptive names" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children.<ref name="Time"></ref> As a result, it was renamed Venusaur, which the gaming website IGN wrote was a combination of "venus" from the plant venus flytrap and "saur" from dinosaur.<ref> urltoken Pokemon Blue Guide & Walkthrough - Game Boy - IGN </ref>
Known as the Seed Pokémon, Venusaur is the final stage of the Bulbasaur evolution tree. The seed on the back of Bulbasaur bloomed into a huge flower, vaguely resembling a Rafflesia. The flower constantly draws in sunlight for nutrition, characterized by vivid colors and a soothing aroma, and power, which is much more substantial in the summer.<ref name="dexvenusaur1">Pokédex: It is able to convert sunlight into energy. As a result, it is more powerful in the summertime. </ref><ref name="dexvenusaur2">Pokédex: There is a large flower on VENUSAUR's back. The flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight. The flower's aroma soothes the emotions of people. </ref> They are always on the move to absorb more sunlight, though they usually remain quiet and still while absorbing it.<ref name="dexvenusaur3">Pokédex: A common sight in forests and woods. It flaps its wings and ground level to kick up blinding sand. </ref> After rain, the aroma is much stronger, which attracts other Pokémon.
Venusaur was given a Mega Evolution about one and a half years into the development of Pokémon X and Y. Bulbasaur, along with Charmander and Squirtle, were added to the game in a significant role in order to allow players to experience its Mega Evolution.<ref></ref>

Venusaur first appeared in the video games Pokémon Red and Blue. It served as the mascot for both Pokémon LeafGreen and the Japanese exclusive version of Red and Blue titled Pocket Monsters Green.

Venusaur is one of the several Pokémon in Pokémon X and Y that are able to use the Mega Evolution mechanic, becoming Mega Venusaur.<ref></ref>
