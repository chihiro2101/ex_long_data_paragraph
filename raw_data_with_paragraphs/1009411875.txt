==Religious and secular music==
Some Ethiopian religious music has an ancient Christian element, traced to Yared, who lived during the reign of Emperor Gebre Meskel who ruled for 14 years during Zagwe dynasty. In northeastern Ethiopia, in Wollo, a Muslim musical form called manzuma developed. Sung in Amharic, manzuma has spread to Harar and Jimma, where it is now sung in the Oromo language. In the Ethiopian Highlands, traditional secular music is played by mostly itinerant musicians called azmaris, who are regarded with respect in Ethiopian society.
==Popular music==
Ethiopia is a musically traditional country. Popular music is played, recorded and listened to, but most musicians also sing traditional songs, and most audiences choose to listen to both popular and traditional styles. A long-standing popular musical tradition in Ethiopia was that of brass bands, imported from Jerusalem in the form of forty Armenian orphans (Arba Lijoch) during the reign of Haile Selassie. This band, which arrived in Addis Ababa on September 6, 1924, became the first official orchestra of Ethiopia. By the end of World War II, large orchestras accompanied singers; the most prominent orchestras were the Army Band, Police Band, and Kebur Zabagna.
From the 1950s to the 1970s, Ethiopian popular musicians included Mahmoud Ahmed, Alemayehu Eshete, Hirut Bekele, Ali Birra, Ayalew Mesfin, Kiros Alemayehu, Muluken Melesse and Tilahun Gessesse, while popular folk musicians included Alemu Aga, Kassa Tessema, Ketema Makonnen, Asnaketch Worku, and Mary Armede. Perhaps the most influential musician of the period, however, was Ethio-jazz innovator Mulatu Astatke. Amha Records, Kaifa Records, and Philips were prominent Ethiopian record labels during this era. Since 1997, Buda Musique's Éthiopiques series has compiled many of these singles and albums on compact disc.
During the 1980s, the Derg controlled Ethiopia, and emigration became almost impossible. Musicians during this period included Ethio Stars, Walias Band and Roha Band, though the singer Neway Debebe was most popular. He helped to popularize the use of seminna-werq (wax and gold, a poetic form of double entendre) in music (previously only used in qiné, or poetry) that often enabled singers to criticize the government without upsetting the censors.
===Contemporary scene===
The most prominent internationally acclaimed singers are Gigi, Munit Mesfin, and Meklit Hadero and those who hold Ethiopian-American dual citizenship. Through her performing with prominent Western jazz musicians such as Bill Laswell (who is also her husband) and Herbie Hancock, Gigi has brought Ethiopian music to popular attention, especially in the United States, where she now lives.
Another noteworthy singer is Neway Debebe, who was very popular among the youth of the 1980s and early 1990s with such songs as "Yetekemt Abeba," "Metekatun Ateye," "Safsaf," and "Gedam" - among others. Abatte Barihun has exemplified all four main qenets on his 2005 album Ras Deshen.<ref name=Barihun />
Éthiopiques producer Francis Falceto criticizes contemporary Ethiopian music for eschewing traditional instruments and ensemble playing in favor of one-man bands using synthesizers.<ref name="afropop-francis"></ref> Harvard University professor Kay Kaufman Shelemay, on the other hand, maintains that there is genuine creativity in the contemporary music scene.<ref name="afropop-kay"></ref> She further points out that Ethiopian music is not alone in shifting to electronically produced music, a point that Falceto acknowledges.<ref name="afropop-francis"/><ref name="afropop-kay"/>
In the West, several bands were also created in recent years to play music inspired by the Éthiopiques series and other examples of Ethiopian music of the '60s and '70s. They include Boston's Either/Orchestra,<ref name=Levessque></ref> Imperial Tiger Orchestra (Switzerland),<ref></ref> and Le Tigre des platanes (France).<ref name=Queille></ref>
New genres of music, popular in western countries, such as EDM, rock and hip hop have been introduced in recent years. Musical acts like Jano Band play a new style of music progressive rock, with mix of Ethiopian music.<ref name=":1"></ref> Hip hop music started influencing Ethiopian music in the early to mid 2000s and culminated with the creation of Ethiopian hip hop, rhymed in the native Amharic language. The earliest and most influential rappers of the hip hop were Teddy Yo and Lij Michael, with the latter being more commercially successful.<ref></ref> The success of both Jano Band and Lij Michael led to their inclusion in the 2017 edition of Coke Studio Africa<ref name=":1" />
The electronic dance music in Ethiopia was not fully developed until mid-2010, although some electronic music employment with hip hop element began in 2000s. 
In 2018, a DJ and recording artist named Rophnan introduced the country to his own version of electronic dance music, winning the album of the year award and changing the mainstream music scene further.<ref> urltoken 
===Record labels===
Since 2016, the most used record label is Hop Music Entertainment by several artists, while Minew Shewa Entertainment and Admas Music used as secondary labels. Hop Music Entertainment, Minew Shewa Entertainment and Dire Tube become the country's online streaming media in recent years.<ref></ref> Dire Tube typically recovers older recordings and music videos. The most notable records throughout 2000s is Nahom Records, which is still in use.

Ethiopian music is a term that can mean any music of Ethiopian origin, however, often it is applied to a genre, a distinct Musical mode that is pentatonic, with characteristically long intervals between some notes.
The music of the Ethiopian Highlands uses a fundamental modal system called qenet, of which there are four main modes: tezeta, bati, ambassel, and anchihoy.<ref name=Grove356></ref> Three additional modes are variations on the above: tezeta minor, bati major, and bati minor.<ref name=":0"></ref><ref name="Barihun">Abatte Barihun, liner notes of the album Ras Deshen, 200.</ref><ref></ref> Some songs take the name of their qenet, such as tizita, a song of reminiscence.<ref name=Grove356 /> When played on traditional instruments, these modes are generally not tempered (that is, the pitches may deviate slightly from the Western-tempered tuning system), but when played on Western instruments such as pianos and guitars, they are played using the Western-tempered tuning system.
Music in the Ethiopian highlands is generally Monophony or heterophony.<ref name=Grove356 /> In certain southern areas, some music is Polyphony. Dorze polyphonic singing (edho) may employ up to five parts; Majangir, four parts.<ref name=Grove356 />
