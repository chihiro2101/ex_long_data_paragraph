Mercyful Fate is a Danish heavy metal band from Copenhagen, formed in 1981 by vocalist King Diamond and guitarist Hank Shermann. Influenced by progressive rock and hard rock, and with lyrics dealing with Satan and the occult, Mercyful Fate were part of the Black metal#First wave in the early to mid-1980s, along with Venom and Bathory.<ref></ref> Many of the bands from this movement went on to influence later black metal musicians in the 1990s, particularly in Norway. Mercyful Fate is also considered to be an important influence to the thrash metal and death metal genres, including bands like Metallica,<ref></ref> Slayer,<ref></ref> Testament,<ref></ref> Death<ref></ref> and Morbid Angel.<ref></ref>
Since its inception in 1981, Mercyful Fate has released seven studio albums, two extended plays, and four compilations. After several line-up changes and self-made demos, they released their self-titled EP in 1982, with the line-up of King Diamond (vocals), Hank Shermann (lead and rhythm guitars), Michael Denner (rhythm and lead guitars), Timi Hansen (bass) and Kim Ruzz (drums). With this line-up the group recorded their first two studio albums (1983's Melissa and 1984's Don't Break the Oath), until 1985 when the band broke up due to musical differences. In 1992, four out of the five members of Mercyful Fate reunited to record the album In the Shadows, which was released the following year. During the 1990s, the band released four more studio albums and went through several line-up changes. Mercyful Fate went on hiatus in 1999, but had reunited on occasion during the 2000s.
On August 1, 2019, it was announced that Mercyful Fate were reuniting on a full-time basis, with plans to tour<ref></ref> and release a new album, which will be their first since 9 in 1999.<ref name="Blabbermouth album"></ref>
