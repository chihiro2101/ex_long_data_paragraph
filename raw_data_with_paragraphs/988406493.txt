* Improve and harmonise contents presentation within family articles
== Assessment ==
To assess articles, use the WikiProject Genealogy banner on the article's talk page.
*Under class, give the article a quality rating: FA, FL, A, GA, B, C, Start, Stub, List, or NA
*Under priority, give the article a priority/importance rating: Top, High, Mid, Low
For example, a good article of high importance will use this code:
<pre></pre>
*Genealogy articles by quality
*Genealogy articles by importance
=== Importance scale ===
Priority must be regarded as a relative term. If priority values are applied within this project, these only reflect the perceived importance to this project. An article judged to be "Top-Class" in one context may be only "Mid-Class" in another project. The criteria used for rating article priority are not meant to be an absolute or canonical view of how significant the topic is. Rather, they attempt to gauge the probability of the average reader of Wikipedia needing to look up the topic (and thus the immediate need to have a suitably well-written article on it).

== Article Alerts ==
* Wikipedia:WikiProject Genealogy/Article alerts
== Templates ==
The most common template used for displaying ancestry trees is (for what the German word Ahnentafel means see the Wikipedia article "Ahnentafel"). For help on how to use and other templates and methods that are available for displaying family/ancestory trees see Help:Family trees and the documentation within the templates.
=== Current template discussions ===
Place below any templates that are potentially useful for members of this project and that are currently the subject of a discussion (most recent first):
* These should automatically appear in Article Alerts.
=== Wikidata equivalent ===
A Wikidata ancestry equivalent similar to WikiTree, for a language independent encyclopedically relevant database, likely containing mostly monarchs and such. Thus, each generation where ancestry is deemed relevant in biographical articles would not need a complete reformatting, while access and implementation over the language board would be facilitated. Naturally, if applied, a new template rendering from this wikidata family tree would be needed. Also, precaution of personal integrity would be a main issue.

* I'm with Another Believer. To restrict this project to Wikipedia in the Eglish language is not a very good idea. What about a domain Wikitree, Wikigenea or something similar? &nbsp;Klaas&nbsp;`Z4&#x241f;`&nbsp;V 08:41, 7 February 2017 (UTC)

The WikiProject for Genealogy aims to improve genealogy-related articles and to standardize and verify genealogical information on Wikipedia. While Wikipedia is not and never was intended as a genealogy software, this area may still be further improved. Nearly all royalty articles include a section of brief ancestry, as well as a list of spouse(s) and issue. This practice may possibly be extended outside the bounds of royalty and aristocracy where encyclopedically relevant, while keeping within Wikipedia's WP:N and WP:V standards.
This project covers all Wikipedia articles related to the subject of genealogy, including businesses, individuals, websites, software, etc. that are involved in the genealogical field. It also covers any genealogical information on notable families, usually formatted as family tree charts, Template:Ahnentafel charts, or lists. Templates to create family trees and ahnentafels are also in the scope of this WikiProject.
