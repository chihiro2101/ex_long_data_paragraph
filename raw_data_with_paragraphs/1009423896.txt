E-government

==Terminology==
E-government is also known as e-gov, electronic government, Internet governance, digital government, online government, connected government. As of 2014 the OECD still uses the term digital government, and distinguishes it from e-government in the recommendation produced there for the Network on E-Government of the Public Governance Committee.<ref>
</ref> Several governments have started to use the term digital government to a wide range of services involving contemporary technology, such as big data, automation or predictive analytics.<ref></ref>
E-gov strategies (or digital government) is defined as "The employment of the Internet and the world-wide-web for delivering government information and services to the citizens." (United Nations, 2006; AOEMA, 2005).<ref name="UNEGovSurvey2014">
</ref> Electronic government (or e-government) essentially refers to "utilization of Information Technology (IT), Information and Communication Technologies (ICT s), and other web-based telecommunication technologies to improve and/or enhance on the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery in the public sector".<ref name="JeongChunHai"/> E-government promotes and improves broad stakeholders contribution to national and community development, as well as deepen the governance process.<ref name="Egov"></ref>
In electronic government systems, government operations are supported by web-based services. It involves the use of information technology, specifically the Internet, to facilitate the communication between the government and its citizens.<ref></ref>
===Transformational government<span id="Transformational Government"></span>===
Transformational government or also transformational e-government is the use of computer-based information and communications technologies (ICT) to change the way governments work.<ref></ref> The term is commonly used to describe a government reform strategy which attempts to radically change the way people understand government, especially those working within government. For example, it is often associated with a whole-of-government viewpoint, which tries to foster cross-department collaboration and provide one-stop-shop convenience in the delivery of services to citizens.
The term transformational government is usually used aspirationally, as denoting the highest level of what e-government can achieve: 
# presence, where ICT, and usually websites, are used to provide information; 
# interaction, where government interacts with citizens, and departments interact with each other, online especially by email;
# transaction, where such things as paying taxes or licenses are carried out online;
# transformation, which involves a reinvention of government functions and how they operate.<ref name=Gartner></ref> In relation to developing countries, it is often associated with hopes of reducing corruption, and in relation to developed countries, with attempts to increase the involvement of the private and voluntary sectors in government activity.
===Government 2.0===
Government 2.0 or Gov 2.0 refers to government policies that aim to harness collaborative technologies and interactive Internet tools to create an open-source computing platform in which government, citizens, and innovative companies can improve transparency and efficiency.<ref></ref> Put simply, Gov 2.0 is about "putting government in the hands of citizens".<ref name=harper></ref> Gov 2.0 combines interactive Web 2.0 fundamentals with e-government and increases citizen participation by using open-source platforms, which allow development of innovative apps, websites, and widgets. The government's role is to provide open data, web services, and platforms as an infrastructure.<ref name=howard></ref>
===E-governance===
E-government should enable anyone visiting a city website to communicate and interact with city employees via the Internet with graphical user interfaces (GUI), instant-messaging (IM), learn about government issues through audio/video presentations, and in any way more sophisticated than a simple email letter to the address provided at the site"<ref>Kaylor, C., Deshazo, R. and Van Eck, D.</ref>
The essence of e-governance is "The enhanced value for stakeholders through transformation"<ref></ref> and "the use of technology to enhance the access to and delivery of government services to benefit citizens, business partners and employees".<ref>Deloitte Research – Public Sector Institute urltoken At the Dawn of e-Government: The Citizen as Customer , 2000</ref> The focus should be on:
* The use of information and communication technologies, and particularly the Internet, as a tool to achieve better government.<ref>OECD. urltoken The e-government imperative: main findings, Policy Brief, Public Affairs Division, Public Affairs and Communications Directorate, OECD, 2003</ref>
* The use of information and communication technologies in all facets of the operations of a government organization.<ref>Grima-Izquierdo, C. (2010). urltoken A generic architecture for e-Government and e-Democracy: requirements, design and security risk analysis. Ed. LAP Publishing.</ref><ref></ref>
* The continuous optimization of service delivery, constituency participation, and governance by transforming internal and external relationships through technology, the Internet and new media.<ref>Gartner Group, "Key Issues in E-Government Strategy and Management," Research Notes, Key Issues, 23 May 2000</ref>
Whilst e-government has traditionally been understood as being centered around the operations of government, e-governance is understood to extend the scope by including citizen engagement and participation in governance. As such, following in line with the OECD definition of e-government, e-governance can be defined as the use of ICTs as a tool to achieve better governance.
===Non-internet e-government===
While e-government is often thought of as "online government" or "Internet-based government," many non-Internet "electronic government" technologies can be used in this context. Some non-Internet forms include telephone, fax, PDA, SMS text messaging, MMS, wireless networks and services, Bluetooth, CCTV, tracking systems, RFID, biometric identification, road traffic management and regulatory enforcement, identity cards, smart cards and other near field communication applications; polling station technology (where non-online e-voting is being considered), TV and radio-based delivery of government services (e.g., CSMW), email, online community facilities, newsgroups and electronic mailing lists, online chat, and instant messenger technologies.
==History==
During the last two decades, governments around the world have invested in ICT with the aim of increasing the quality and decreasing the cost of public services. But over that time, as even the least developed countries have moved to websites, e-services and e-government strategies, it has become increasingly clear that e-government has not delivered all the benefits that were hoped for it.<ref>‘The failure of e-government in developing countries: a literature review’. The Electronic Journal on Information System in Developing Countries. Dada, D. (2006)</ref> One study found that 35% of e-government projects in developing countries resulted in total failures; and that 50% were partial failures.<ref></ref>
In reaction to these poor outcomes, there has been a shift of perspective to transformational government, aiming beyond purely technical aspects of better enabling e-government processes towards addressing the cultural and organisational barriers which have hindered public service benefits realisation. Researchers have defined the rationale for transformational government as "the exploitation of e-government such that benefits can be realized".<ref>Electronic transformation of government in the UK: A
research agenda. European Journal of Information Systems 16, 327-335 Irani, Z., Elliman, T. and Jackson, P. (2007)</ref>
In 2010 the OASIS (organization) (OASIS) published a report<ref name="oasis-egov.org"></ref> which identified a wide range of common pitfalls which have hampered many governments in achieving significant impacts through their technology investments. However, OASIS also noted that:
:"… an increasing number of governments are now getting to grips with the much broader and complex set of cultural and organizational changes which are needed for ICT to deliver significant benefits to the public sector. This new approach is generally referred to as Transformational Government."
OASIS cites <ref name="oasis-egov.org"/> the UK and Australia as two of the leaders in this area:
: "Transformational Government…. encompasses a new "virtual" business layer within government which allows an integrated, government-wide, citizen-focused service to be presented to citizens across all channels, but at no extra cost and without having to restructure government to do so. Two very good examples of this new approach are South Australia’s "Ask Just Once" portal and the UK Government’s DirectGov portal, and the approach is explained in very good detail in the CS Transform’s white paper entitled "Citizen Service Transformation – a manifesto for change in the delivery of public services".
==UN e-Government Development Index==
The Division of a Public Administration and Development Management (DPAPM) of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN-DESA) conducts a bi-annual e-government survey which includes a section titled e-Government Development Index (EGDI). It is a comparative ranking of 193 countries of the world according to three primary indicators: i) the OSI - Online Service Index that measures the online presence of the government in terms of service delivery; ii) the TII - Telecommunication Infrastructure Index iii) HCI -Human Capital Index. Constructing a model for the measurement of digitized services, the Survey assesses the 193 member states of the UN according to a quantitative composite index of e-government readiness based on website assessment; telecommunication infrastructure and human resource endowment.<ref name="egovsurvey16" />
A diverse group of 100 researchers online volunteers from across the globe engaged with the United Nations Department of Economic Affairs (UN DESA) to process 386 research surveys carried out across 193 UN Member States for the 2016 UN E-Government Survey.<ref name="egovsurvey16"></ref> The diversity of nationalities and languages of the online volunteers<ref> urltoken Online Volunteering service, Experiences</ref>—more than 65 languages, 15 nationalities, of which half are from developing countries—mirrors perfectly the mission of the survey.
The survey has been criticized not including an index of digital inclusion levels.<ref></ref>
==Delivery models and activities of e-government==
The primary delivery models of e-government can be divided into:
* G2C or government-to-consumer (G2C) approaches such as setting up websites where citizens can download forms, government information, etc.
** In this model, the G2C model applies the strategy of customer relationship management (CRM) with business concept.
** By managing their "customer" (citizen) relationship, the business (government) can provide the needed products and services fulfill the needs of the customer (citizen).
** In United States, the NPR (National Partnership for Reinventing Government) has been implemented from 1993.<ref>Larsen, B., & Milakovich, M. (January 1, 2005). Citizen Relationship Management and E-Government. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3591, 57–68</ref>
* Government-to-business (G2B)
* Government-to-government (G2G)
* Government-to-employees (G2E)
Within each of these interaction domains, four kinds of activities take place:<ref>Mary Maureen Brown. "Electronic Government" Jack Rabin (ed.). Encyclopedia of Public Administration and Public Policy, Marcel Dekker, 2003, pp. 427–432 .</ref><ref></ref>
* pushing information over the Internet, e.g.: regulatory services, general holidays, public hearing schedules, issue briefs, notifications, etc.
* two-way communications between the agency and the citizen, a business, or another government agency. In this model, users can engage in dialogue with agencies and post problems, comments, or requests to the agency.
* conducting transactions, e.g.: lodging tax returns, applying for services and grants.
* governance, e.g.: To enable the citizen transition from passive information access to active citizen participation by:
# Informing the citizen
# Representing the citizen
# Encouraging the citizen to vote
# Consulting the citizen
# Involving the citizen
Examples of online transactional services, employed in e-governments include:<ref> urltoken E-government survey 2020, table 1.10</ref>
* Applying for a birth certificate
* Applying for a building permit
* Applying for a business license
* Applying for a death certificate
* Applying for a driver's license
* Applying for environmental permits
* Applying for E-procurement
* Applying for land title registration
* Applying for a marriage certificate
* Applying for a personal identity card
* Applying for social protection programs
* Applying for a visa
* Declaring to police
* Paying fines
* Paying for utilities (water, gas electricity)
* Registering a business
* Registering a motor vehicle
* Looking up land registration info
* Looking up address and telephone number info in online telephone directory
* Submitting a change of address
* Submitting income taxes
* Submitting Value Added Tax
== Controversies ==
===Disadvantages===
The main disadvantages concerning e-government are the lack of equality in public access to computers and the internet (the "digital divide", a reference to the fact that people who have low incomes, who are homeless and/or who live in remote regions may have little or no access to the Internet), reliability of information on the web, and issues that could influence and bias public opinions. There are many considerations and potential implications of implementing and designing e-government, including disintermediation of the government and its citizens, impacts on economic, social, and political factors, vulnerability to cyber attacks, and disturbances to the status quo in these areas.<ref name="information137"></ref> See also Electronic leviathan.
The political nature of public sector forms are also cited as disadvantages to e-government systems.<ref></ref>
=== Trust ===
Trust in e-governance is very highly dependent on its performance and execution, which can be measured through the effectiveness of current actions. This is much riskier and prone to fluctuation than a system of trust that is based on reputation because performance does not consider past actions.<ref></ref>
=== Development ===
Because E-government is in the early stages of development in many countries and jurisdictions, it is hard to be applied to forms of government that have been institutionalized. Age-old bureaucratic practices being delivered in new mediums or using new technologies can lead to problems of miscommunication<ref></ref>
====Hyper-surveillance====
Increased electronic contact and data exchange between government and its citizens goes both ways. Once e-government technologies become more sophisticated, citizens will be likely be encouraged to interact electronically with the government for more transactions, as e-services are much less costly than brick and mortar service offices (physical buildings) staffed by civil servants. This could potentially lead to a decrease in privacy for civilians as the government obtains more and more information about their activities. Without safeguards, government agencies might share information on citizens. In a worst-case scenario, with so much information being passed electronically between government and civilians, a totalitarian-like system could develop. When the government has easy access to countless information on its citizens, personal privacy is lost.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
====Cost====
Although "a prodigious amount of money has been spent"<ref>The good, the bad and the inevitable | The Economist urltoken on the development and implementation of e-government, some say it has yielded only a mediocre result. The outcomes and effects of trial Internet-based government services are often difficult to gauge or users seem them unsatisfactory.<ref></ref>
According to Gartner, Worldwide IT spending is estimated to total $3.6 trillion in 2011 which is 5.1% increase from the year 2010 ($3.4 trillion).<ref></ref>
====Inaccessibility====
An e-government website that provides government services often does not offer the "potential to reach many users including those who live in remote areas without Internet access, are homebound, have low literacy levels, exist on poverty line incomes."<ref></ref> Homeless people, people in poverty and elderly people may not have access.
====False sense of transparency and accountability====
Opponents of e-government argue that online governmental transparency is dubious because it is maintained by the governments themselves. Information can be added or removed from the public eye. To this day, very few organizations monitor and provide accountability for these modifications. Those that do so, like the United States’ OMBWatch<ref></ref> and Government Accountability Project, are often nonprofit volunteers. Even the governments themselves do not always keep track of the information they insert and delete.<ref></ref>
===Advantages===
The ultimate goal of the e-government is to be able to offer an increased portfolio of public services to citizens in an efficient and cost-effective manner. E-government allows for government transparency. Government transparency is important because it allows the public to be informed about what the government is working on as well as the policies they are trying to implement.
Simple tasks may be easier to perform through electronic government access. Many changes, such as marital status or address changes can be a long process and take a lot of paperwork for citizens. E-government allows these tasks to be performed efficiently with more convenience to individuals.
E-government is an easy way for the public to be more involved in political campaigns. It could increase voter awareness, which could lead to an increase in citizen participation in elections.
It is convenient and cost-effective for businesses, and the public benefits by getting easy access to the most current information available without having to spend time, energy and money to get it.
E-government helps simplify processes and makes government information more easily accessible for public sector agencies and citizens. For example, the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles simplified the process of certifying driver records to be admitted in county court proceedings.<ref> urltoken Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. In.gov (2009-06-16). Retrieved on 2012-06-25.</ref> Indiana became the first state to allow government records to be digitally signed, legally certified and delivered electronically by using Electronic Postmark technology. In addition to its simplicity, e-democracy services can reduce costs. Alabama Department of Conservation & Natural Resources, Wal-Mart and NIC<ref></ref> developed an online hunting and fishing license service utilizing an existing computer to automate the licensing process. More than 140,000 licenses were purchased at Wal-Mart stores during the first hunting season and the agency estimates it will save $200,000 annually from service.<ref></ref>
The anticipated benefits of e-government include efficiency, improved services, better accessibility of public services, sustainable community development and more transparency and accountability.<ref name="information137"/>
====Democratization====
One goal of some e-government initiatives is greater citizen participation. Through the Internet's Web 2.0 interactive features, people from all over the country can provide input to politicians or public servants and make their voices heard. Blogging and interactive surveys allow politicians or public servants to see the views of the people on any issue. Chat rooms can place citizens in real-time contact with elected officials or their office staff or provide them with the means to interact directly with public servants, allowing voters to have a direct impact and influence in their government. These technologies can create a more transparent government, allowing voters to immediately see how and why their representatives in the capital are voting the way they are. This helps voters decide whom to vote for in the future or how to help the public servants become more productive.
A government could theoretically move more towards a true democracy with the proper application of e-government. Open government will give insight to the public on how decisions are made and hold elected officials or public servants accountable for their actions. The public could become a direct and prominent influence in government legislature to some degree.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
====Environmental bonuses====
Proponents of e-government argue that online government services would lessen the need for hard copy paper forms.<ref></ref> Due to recent pressures from Environmentalism groups, the media, and the public, some governments and organizations have turned to the Internet to reduce paper use. The United States government utilizes the website urltoken to provide "internal government forms for federal employees" and thus "produce significant savings in paper.<ref></ref> As well, if citizens can apply for government services or permits online, they may not need to drive into a government office, which could lead to less air pollution from gas and diesel-fuelled vehicles.
====Speed, efficiency, and convenience====
E-government allows citizens to interact with computers to achieve objectives at any time and any location and eliminates the necessity for physical travel to government agents sitting behind desks and windows. Many e-government services are available to citizens with computers and Internet access 24 hours a day and seven days a week, in contrast to brick and mortar government offices, which tend to be only open during business hours (notable exceptions are police stations and hospitals, which are usually open 24 hours a day so that staff can deal with emergencies).
Improved accounting and record keeping can be noted through computerization, and information and forms can be easily accessed by citizens with computers and Internet access, which may enable quicker processing time for applications and find information. On the administrative side, access to help find or retrieve files and linked information can now be stored in electronic databases versus hard copies (paper copies) stored in various locations. Individuals with disabilities or conditions that affect their mobility no longer have to be mobile to be active in government and can access public services in the comfort of their own homes<ref>Satyanarayana, J. E-Government: The Science of the Possible. India: Prentice Hall, 2004.</ref><ref></ref> (as long as they have a computer and Internet and any accessibility equipment they may need).
====Public approval====
Recent trials of e-government have been met with acceptance and eagerness from the public.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Citizens participate in online discussions of political issues with increasing frequency, and young people, who traditionally display minimal interest in government affairs, are drawn to electronic voting procedures.
Although Internet-based governmental programs have been criticized for lack of reliable privacy policies, studies have shown that people value prosecution of offenders over personal confidentiality. Ninety percent of United States adults approve of Internet tracking systems of criminals, and 57% are willing to forgo some of their personal internet privacy if it leads to the prosecution of criminals or terrorists.<ref></ref>
==Technology-specific e-government==
There are also some technology-specific sub-categories of e-government, such as m-government (mobile government), ubiquitous government), and g-government (GIS/GPS applications for e-government).
The previous concern about developments in E-government concerning technology are due to the limited use of online platforms for political reasons by citizens in local political participations.<ref></ref>
The primary delivery models of e-government are classified depending on who benefits. In the development of the public sector or private sector portals and platforms, a system is created that benefits all constituents. Citizens needing to renew their vehicle registration have a convenient way to accomplish it while already engaged in meeting the regulatory inspection requirement. On behalf of a government partner, the business provides what has traditionally, and solely, managed by the government and can use this service to generate profit or attract new customers. Government agencies are relieved of the cost and complexity of having to process the transactions.<ref>Government Technology’s Public CIO Thought Leadership Profile urltoken "Expanding eGovernment, Every Day" open-access online paper 2006.</ref>
To develop these public sector portals or platforms, governments have the choice to internally develop and manage, outsource, or sign a self-funding contract. The self-funding model creates portals that pay for themselves through convenience fees for certain e-government transactions, known as self-funding portals.
=== Social Media Usage ===
Social networking services and websites are an emerging area for e-democracy. The social networking entry point is within the citizens’ environment and the engagement is on the citizens’ terms. Proponents of e-government perceive the government's use of social networking as a medium to help the government act more like the public it serves. Examples can be found at almost every state government portal through Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube widgets.
Government and its agents also have the opportunity to follow citizens to monitor satisfaction with services they receive. Through ListServs, RSS feeds, mobile messaging, micro-blogging services and blogs, government and its agencies can share information to citizens who share common interests and concerns. Government is also beginning to Twitter. In the state of Rhode Island, Treasurer Frank T. Caprio is offering daily tweets of the state's cash flow.<ref> urltoken RI Treasury (@RITreasury) op Twitter. Twitter.com. Retrieved on 2012-06-25.</ref> For a full list of state agencies with Twitter feeds, visit NIC.<ref></ref> For more information, visit transparent-gov.com.<ref></ref>
=== E-Signature ===
Several local governments in the United States have allowed online e-signatures for candidate nominating petitions and Ballot measure. In 2012 Arizona launched a prototype system called E-qual, which allowed statewide candidates running for office to collect signatures online and share the link on other forms on social media.<ref></ref> E-qual was expanded in 2016 to cover candidates in local elections within the state,<ref></ref> but it was not used at the local level before the 2020 state election.<ref></ref>
====UK====
Transformational Government: Enabled by Technology, 2005:<ref></ref> "The future of public services has to use technology to give citizens choice, with personalised services designed around their needs not the needs of the provider"
===North America===
====Canada====
The current Clerk of the Privy Council – the head of the federal public service has made workplace renewal a pillar of overall public service renewal. The key to workplace renewal is the adoption of collaborative networked tools. An example of such a tool is GCPEDIA – a wiki platform for federal public servants. Other tools include GCconnex, a social networking tool, and GCforums, a discussion board system.
Report of the Auditor General of Canada: Chapter 1 Information Technology: Government On-Line 2003:<ref> urltoken Canada - Report of the Auditor General of Canada, 2003 </ref> "One of the key principles of Government On-Line is that programs and services will be transformed to reflect the needs and expectations of clients and citizens. From the government’s perspective, the overall objective of the GOL initiative is full service transformation – to fundamentally change the way the government operates and to deliver better services to Canadians."
====United States====
The election of Barack Obama as President of the United States became associated with the effective use of Internet technologies during his campaign and in the implementation of his new administration in 2009.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> On January 21, 2009, the President signed one of his first memorandums – the Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies on Transparency and Open Government.<ref name="Transparency and Open Government"> urltoken Transparency and Open Government. Whitehouse.gov. Retrieved on 2012-06-25.</ref> The memo called for an unprecedented level of openness in government, asking agencies to "ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration."<ref name="Transparency and Open Government"/> The memo further "directs the Chief Technology Officer, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Administrator of General Services (GSA), to coordinate the development by appropriate executive departments and agencies and to take specific actions implementing the principles set forth in the memorandum."<ref name="Transparency and Open Government"/>
President Obama's memorandum centered around the idea of increasing transparency throughout various different federal departments and agencies. By enabling public websites like recovery.gov and data.gov to distribute more information to the American population, the administration believes that it will gain greater citizen participation.<ref></ref>
In 2009 the U.S. federal government launched Data.gov to make more government data available to the public. With data from Data.Gov, the public can build apps, websites, and mashups. Although "Gov 2.0", as a concept and as a term, had been in existence since the mid-2000s, it was the launch of Data.gov that made it "go viral".<ref name=harper />
In August 2009 the City of San Francisco launched urltoken DataSF.org with more than a hundred datasets.<ref></ref> Just weeks after the DataSF.org launch, new apps and websites were developed. Using data feeds available on DataSF.org, civic-minded developers built programs to display public transportation arrival and departure times,<ref></ref> where to recycle hazardous materials,<ref></ref> and crime patterns.<ref></ref> Since the launch of DataSF.org there have been more than seventy apps created with San Francisco's data.
In March 2009, former San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom was at Twitter headquarters for a conversation about technology in government.<ref> urltoken "A Conversation with Twitter about the Future of Technology in Government" (video), Gavin Newsom and Evan Williams, Mayor's Press Conference (YouTube), 10 March 2009, 47 minutes.</ref> During the town hall, Newsom received a tweet about a pothole.<ref name=mitch></ref> He turned to Twitter co-founders Biz Stone and Evan Williams and said let's find a way for people to tweet their service requests directly to San Francisco's 311 customer service center. Three months later, San Francisco launched the first Twitter 311 service, called @SF311, allowing residents to tweet, text, and send photos of potholes and other requests directly to the city.<ref></ref> Working with Twitter and using the open-source platform, CoTweet turned @SF311 into reality. The software procurement process for something like this would normally have taken months, but in this case, it took less than three months.<ref></ref> The @SF311 is saving the city money in call center costs.<ref></ref> In 2011, The United States Government Accountability Office passed the Electronic Government Act in 2002 to promote better use of internet and information technology. Besides, to improve government services for citizens, internal government operations, and opportunities for citizen participation in government.<ref></ref>
Presidential Innovation Fellows program where "teams of government experts and private-sector doers take a user-centric approach to issues at the intersection of people, processes, products, and policy to achieve lasting impact"<ref></ref> launched in 2012.<ref></ref> 18F a new digital government delivery service, was formed in early 2014<ref></ref> and United States Digital Service (USDS) was launched later in 2014.<ref></ref>
===South America===
====Brazil====
The goal defined in the Digital Government Strategy is to reach the total digitization of services by the end of 2022.<ref name=":1"></ref>
"The main objective of the digital government is to bring citizens closer to the State. Technologies allow us to see each Brazilian better, including those who feel excluded, to direct public policies in a much more agile and efficient way and to reach mainly those who need it most ", emphasizes the Digital Government secretary of the Ministry of Economy, Luís Felipe Monteiro .<ref name=":1" />
===International initiatives===
The early pioneering work by some governments is now being picked up by a range of global organizations which offer support to governments in moving to a transformational government approach. For example:
*The World Bank has set up an eTransform Initiative (ETI) with support from global IT partners such as Gemalto, IBM, L-1 Identity Solutions, Microsoft and Pfizer. "The eTransform Initiative is about tapping information technology, expertise and experiences", said Mohsen Khalil, Director of the World Bank Group's Global Information and Communication Technologies Department. "Government transformation is about change management facilitated by technology. This initiative will facilitate the exchange of lessons and experiences among various governments and industry players, to maximize impact and lower risks of ICT-enabled government transformation."
*A number of private sector organizations working in this area have published white papers which pull together global best practices on government transformation.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
*OASIS launched (September 2010) a new Technical Committee tasked with producing a new global best practice standard for a transformational government Framework. The Framework is expressed as a number of "Pattern Languages", each providing a detailed set of guidance notes and conformance clauses on how to deliver the required changes in practice.

E-government (short for electronic government) is the use of technological communications devices, such as computers and the Internet, to provide public services to citizens and other persons in a country or region. E-government offers new opportunities for more direct and convenient citizen access to government, and for government provision of services directly to citizens.<ref></ref>
The term consists of the digital interactions between a citizen and their government (C2G), between governments and other government agencies (G2G), between government and citizens (G2C), between government and employees (G2E), and between government and businesses/commerces (G2B). E-government delivery models can be broken down into the following categories:<ref name="JeongChunHai">Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim. (2007). Fundamental of Development Administration.
