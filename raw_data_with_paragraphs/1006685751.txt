The World Is Not Enough

==Release and reception==
The World Is Not Enough premiered on 19 November 1999 in the United States and on 26 November 1999 in the United Kingdom. Its world premiere was 8 November 1999 at the Fox Bruin Theater, Los Angeles, USA.<ref></ref> At that time MGM signed a marketing partnership with MTV, primarily for American youths, who were assumed to have considered Bond as "an old-fashioned secret service agent". As a result, MTV broadcast more than 100 hours of Bond-related programmes immediately after the film was released, most being presented by Denise Richards.<ref></ref>
===Box office===
The film opened at the top of the North American box office with $35.5 million. Its final worldwide gross was $361.8 million worldwide,<ref name="boxoffice" /> with $126 million in the United States alone.<ref name="boxoffice"></ref> It became the highest grossing James Bond film of all time until the release of Die Another Day.<ref></ref> The film was also selected for the first round of nominations for the Academy Award but failed.<ref></ref> The film was nominated for a Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film Saturn Award, Pierce Brosnan won both the Empire Award and the Blockbuster Inc. as Best Actor, and David Arnold won a BMI Film Music Award for his score. The film became the first in the Bond series to win a Golden Raspberry when Denise Richards was chosen as "Worst Supporting Actress" at the 1999 Razzie Awards. Richards and Brosnan were also nominated for "Worst Screen Couple" (lost to Will Smith and Kevin Kline for Wild Wild West).<ref></ref> 
The initial release of the DVD includes the featurette "Secrets of 007", which cuts into "making of" material during the film; the documentary "The Making of The World Is Not Enough"; two Audio commentary—one by director Michael Apted, and the other by production designer Peter Lamont, second unit director Vic Armstrong, and composer David Arnold; a trailer for the PlayStation video game, and the Garbage music video.<ref></ref> The Ultimate Edition released in 2006 had as additional extras a 2000 documentary named "Bond Cocktail", a featurette on shooting the Q Boat scenes, Pierce Brosnan in a press conference in Hong Kong, deleted scenes, and a tribute to Desmond Llewelyn.<ref></ref>
===Critical reception===
Reception was mixed. Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert said the film was a "splendid comic thriller, exciting and graceful, endlessly inventive", and gave it three-and-a-half stars out of four.<ref name="ebert-review"></ref> On the other hand, Eleanor Ringel Gillespie of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution disliked the film, calling it "dated and confused".<ref></ref> Rotten Tomatoes gave The World Is Not Enough a 52% rating, the lowest of the Brosnan Bond films. The site's consensus states: "Plagued by mediocre writing, uneven acting, and a fairly by-the-numbers plot, The World Is Not Enough is partially saved by some entertaining and truly Bond-worthy action sequences."<ref name="rt"></ref> Metacritic gives the film a score of 59 out of 100.<ref></ref> Nathan Rabin from The A.V. Club opined that "enough fun moments are scattered throughout to make it a decent Bond entry. But the series still needs a massive shot of fresh ideas if it wishes to become anything more than a nostalgia-fueled commercial sure thing".<ref name=AVC></ref> Antonia Quirke from The Independent said that the film "is certainly less definitively feeble than other recent Bond offerings, with an at least two-dimensional female character in the bold and oval Marceau. But my reaction is much the same as to a new Rolling Stones album: I'm just grateful that it's not embarrassing".<ref></ref> Negative criticism was focused on the execution of the plot, and the action scenes were considered excessive.<ref></ref>
Richards was widely criticized for not being credible in the role of a nuclear scientist, with Variety calling her "the least plausible nuclear physicist in the history of movies, who makes even the electrochemist Elisabeth Shue played in 1997’s The Saint sound like a Nobel laureate"; Nathan Rabin panned her performance and called it "so laughably awful that the film comes to a dead stop whenever she's on screen".<ref></ref><ref>Howe, Desson, 19 November 1999, urltoken 'World': Bond without end, Washington Post.</ref><ref name="Variety"></ref><ref name=AVC/> She was ranked as one of the worst Bond girls of all time by Entertainment Weekly in 2008.<ref></ref>
==== Retrospective ====
Pete Debruge of Variety wrote in 2012 that "The World Is Not Enough presents a conflicted persona torn between the corny antics of the Roger Moore era and the grim seriousness of where things would eventually go under Daniel Craig’s tenure. It also contains a dose of Timothy Dalton-esque toughness . Much of what made Brosnan such a great Bond is thrust into the backseat by lame jokes and a premature attempt to mix up the formula", concluding that it was "nothing but a reversion to the franchise’s most adolescent tendencies".<ref name="Variety" /> Entertainment Weekly picked it as the worst Bond film of all time in 2006, saying it had a plot "so convoluted even Pierce Brosnan has admitted to being mystified".<ref></ref> Norman Wilner of MSN chose it as the third worst film, above A View to a Kill and Licence to Kill,<ref></ref> while IGN chose it as the fifth worst, both in 2007<ref></ref>
==Adaptations==
Bond novelist Raymond Benson wrote his adaptation of The World Is Not Enough from the film's screenplay. It was Benson's fourth Bond novel and followed the story closely, but with some details changed. For instance, Elektra sings quietly before her death and Bond still carries his Walther PPK instead of the newer P99. The novel also gave the cigar girl/assassin the name Giulietta da Vinci and retained a scene between her and Renard that was cut from the film.
In 2000, the film was adapted by Electronic Arts to create two first-person shooters of the same name for the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation. The Nintendo 64 version was developed by Eurocom and the PlayStation version was developed by Black Ops.<ref>Black Ops had previously adapted Tomorrow Never Dies for the PlayStation and would go on to develop Nightfire in 2002.</ref> Versions of The World Is Not Enough for the PC and the PlayStation 2 were planned for release in 2000, but both were cancelled.<ref></ref> These versions would have used the id Tech 3 game engine from Quake III Arena. Although this game marks Pierce Brosnan's fifth appearance in a Bond video game, the game includes only his likeness; the character is voiced by Adam Blackwood.<ref></ref>

</ref> Arnold broke tradition by not ending the film with a reprise of the opening theme or, as with the previous three films, a new song. Originally, Arnold intended to use the song "Only Myself to Blame" at the end of the film; however, Apted discarded this and the song was replaced by a remix of the "James Bond Theme".<ref name="arnold" /> "Only Myself to Blame", written by Arnold and Don Black and sung by Scott Walker, is the 19th and final track on the album and its melody is Elektra King's theme. The theme is heard in "Casino", "Elektra's Theme" and "I Never Miss".<ref name="arnold"></ref> Arnold added two new themes to the final score, both of which are reused in the following film, Die Another Day.
The title song, "The World Is Not Enough", was written by David Arnold with Don Black and performed by Garbage. It is the fifth Bond theme co-written by Black, preceded by "Thunderball",<ref></ref> "Diamonds Are Forever",<ref></ref> "The Man with the Golden Gun",<ref></ref> and "Tomorrow Never Dies".<ref name="tnd1"></ref> IGN chose "The World Is Not Enough" as the ninth-best James Bond theme of all time.<ref></ref> In 2012 Grantland ranked the song as the second-best Bond song of all-time, behind only "Goldfinger."<ref> urltoken What’s the Greatest Bond Song of All Time? « </ref> The song also appeared in two "best of 1999" polls: #87 in 89X's "Top 89 Songs of 1999"<ref></ref> and No. 100 in Q101's "Top 101 of 1999".<ref></ref>
