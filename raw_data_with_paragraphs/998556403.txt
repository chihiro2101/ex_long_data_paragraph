== History ==
The Penobscot people long inhabited the area between present-day Old Town and Bangor, and still occupy tribal land on the nearby Penobscot Indian Island Reservation. The first European to visit the site was probably the Portugal Esteban Gómez in 1524, who was working for Spain. He was followed by the French explorer Samuel de Champlain in 1605.<ref>
</ref> Champlain was looking for the mythical city of Norumbega, thought to be where Bangor now lies. French missionary priests settled among the Penobscot. This valley was contested between France and Britain into the 1750s; after Britain defeated France in the Seven Years' War, the territory became dominated by England. It was one of the last northern regions to become part of New England. One of the most important Penobscot chiefs was Madockawando.

There were tensions on the border between New England and Acadia, which New France defined as reaching the Kennebec River in southern Maine.<ref>William Williamson. The History of the State of Maine.

To secure New France's claim to present-day Maine, New France established Catholic missions among the three largest native villages in the region: one on the Kennebec River (Norridgewock); one farther north on the Penobscot River (Penobscot) and one on the Saint John River (Medoctec).<ref></ref><ref>John Grenier, The Far Reaches of Empire.

On Abbé Petit's advice, Father Louis-Pierre Thury settled at Pentagouet (Castine, Maine) in 1690, near Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin, where he remained eight years. He acquired great influence over the Abenaki and took part in their expeditions. In 1689 he accompanied Saint-Castin on the raid that resulted in the destruction of Pemaquid (1689); he left a detailed account of events. In 1692 Thury accompanied a war party against York (Maine) in what became known as the Candlemas Massacre.
==== Raid on Penobscot (1692) ====
Benjamin Church's third expedition to Acadia during the war was in 1692 when he conducted a retaliatory raid with 450 men against the Penobscot village.<ref>The History of the Great Indian War of 1675 and 1676, commonly called Philip . by Benjamin Church, Thomas Church, Samuel Gardner Drake, p.212</ref>
Two years later, Thury worked to thwart the actions of Phips, who wanted to keep the Abenaki neutral; Thury played an important role in retaining them under French influence. He took part in the Raid on Oyster River in New Hampshire, and was present with Robinau de Villebon and a party of Abenaki at the capture of Pemaquid by Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville in 1696. The bishop of Quebec made him his vicar general in 1698 and appointed him to be the superior of the missions in Acadia.<ref> urltoken THURY, LOUIS-PIERRE, Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online</ref>
Madockawando and others from Penobscot fought alongside Hertel Portneuf and St. Castin at the Battle of Fort Loyal (May 1690). They were also involved in Raid on Wells (1692). Finally they accompanied Villie in the Raid on Oyster River in 1694. He died during the war in 1697.<ref>Wheeler, p. 14</ref>
=== Father Rale's War ===
==== Raid on Thomaston (1722) ====
On 15 July 1722, Father Lauverjat from Penobscot led 500-600 natives from Penobscot and Medunic (Maliseet) to lay siege to Fort St. Georges in Colonel Thomas Westbrook's home town of Thomaston for twelve days. They burned the sawmill, a large sloop, and sundry houses, and killed many of their cattle. Five New Englanders were killed and seven were taken prisoner, while the New Englanders killed twenty Maliseet and Penobscot warriors.<ref>Grenier, p. 59; William Williamson, p. 115; Also see History of Thomaston, Rockland, and South Thomaston, Maine: from ., Volume 1, by Cyrus Eaton, p. 30, and Grenier, 2008, p. 56</ref>
==== Raid on Penobscot (1723) ====
During Father Rale's War, Father Lauverjat was established at the mission.<ref>Wheeler, p. 13</ref> On March 9, 1723, Colonel Thomas Westbrook from Thomaston led 230 men to the Penobscot River and traveled approximately upstream to the Penobscot village. They found a large Penobscot fort— by , with walls surrounding 23 wigwams. There was also a large chapel . The village was vacant of people, and the soldiers burned it to the ground.<ref>(William Williamson, p. 120)</ref>
Starting in 1775, Condeskeag became the site of treaty negotiations by which the Penobscot people were made to give up almost all their ancestral lands, a process complete by about 1820, when Maine became a state. The tribe was eventually left with only their main village on an island upriver from Bangor, called "Indian Old Town" by the settlers. Eventually a white settlement taking the name Old Town was planted on the river bank opposite the Penobscot village, which began to be called "Indian Island." It continues as the base of the federally recognized Penobscot people.<ref> urltoken "The Ancient Penobscot, or Panawanskek", John E. Godfrey, Retrieved June 20, 2008</ref>
