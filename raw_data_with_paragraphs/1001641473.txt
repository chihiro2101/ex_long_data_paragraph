O'Neill was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Gaynald Elsie (Irvin) and John Paul O'Neill, an army sergeant.<ref></ref> His father claimed that he was from Scotland and that he didn't know where his family was anymore. A long time after his death, however, Paul discovered that he was actually from Netherlands and was originally named Piet Kalfsterman, though it isn't known why he lied to his family about his background.<ref name=WSJ20200420/>
Due to his father's transfers, the family had to change residences often. They lived in Illinois, Hawaii, New Mexico and Alaska. As a teenager, Paul worked part-time jobs including as a paperboy and as a clerk at a convenience store.<ref name=WSJ20200420/> He graduated from Anchorage High School in Anchorage, Alaska in 1954.

O'Neill was chairman and CEO of the Pittsburgh industrial giant Alcoa from 1987 to 1999 and retired as chairman at the end of 2000.

In December 1997, O'Neill together with Karen Wolk Feinstein, President of the Jewish Healthcare Foundation, founded the Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative (PRHI).<ref></ref> They assembled a wide-ranging coalition of healthcare interests to begin to address the problems of healthcare, as a region. PRHI adapted the principles of the Toyota Production System into the "Perfecting Patient Care" system.<ref></ref> O'Neill became a leader locally and nationally in addressing issues of patient safety and quality in healthcare.<ref></ref>
O'Neill was a co-founder of Pittsburgh's Riverlife Task Force, established in 1999.

O'Neill became a trustee of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in February 2003, but left in September 2004 due to it not joining a programme to make hospitals eliminate medical errors.

==Bush Administration==
O'Neill was appointed as the Secretary of the Treasury by the newly elected president George W. Bush in January 2001. He believed in fiscal prudence, increasing productivity and also encouraging workers with safeguards for their jobs. As the secretary he strongly disagreed with the strong dollar policy, ceremonial speeches and large bailouts, while favoring personally touring American factories and reducing the length of written statements by the finance ministers belonging to the Group of Seven. O'Neill saw the United States through the 2001 recession and 9/11 attacks. He initially helped pass the first tax cuts under the Bush administration but stringently opposed the second. He also clashed with Bush on his steel tariffs as well as actions against Cuba.<ref name="Bloo-20180420"></ref>
O'Neill also helped Turkey, Argentina and Brazil in receiving loans from International Monetary Fund but opposed more financial assistance. His cavalcade was once attacked with eggs during a visit to Argentina because of him stating the country had “no industry to speak of.” He however also encouraged governments to increase grants by World Bank and cracking down on monetary support of terrorism. In May 2002, he visited Africa with Bono to draw attention to the continent's poor. During his tenure, he was known for his outspokenness which would eventually cost him his job in December 2002.<ref name="Bloo-20180420"/>
Ron Suskind interviewed O'Neill extensively about his tenure in the Bush Administration. He was also given access to a large amount of documentation. In 2004 he produced the book The Price of Loyalty, detailing O'Neill's tenure in the Bush Administration.<ref>The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill 2004</ref> The book describes many of the conflicts that O'Neill had with the Bush administration. The book also details O'Neill's criticisms of some of Bush's economic policies. O'Neill claims that Bush appeared somewhat unquestioning and incurious, and that the war in Iraq was planned from the first National Security Council meeting, soon after the administration took office. At the first cabinet meeting of the new Bush administration, O'Neill observed that the debate was not "should we attack Iraq?" but rather "how do we go about attacking Iraq?" <ref> urltoken Ron Suskind, George W.

===Comments and views===
In an October 16, 2007, opinion piece published in the New York Times, he wrote of the reluctance among politicians to address comprehensive reform in the U.S. health care system. In the opinion, he suggested that doctors and hospitals should be required to report medical errors within 24 hours, as well as moving malpractice suits out of the civil courts and into a new, independent body. He also felt that health care reform had to acknowledge all aspects of the problem, such as insurance coverage, medical costs, quality of care, and information technology.<ref></ref>
In April 2016, he was one of eight former Treasury secretaries who called on the United Kingdom to remain a member of the European Union ahead of the June 2016 Referendum.<ref></ref>
