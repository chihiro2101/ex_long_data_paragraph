HMS Invincible (R05)

==Design==
As built, Invincible was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of at the waterline and at flight deck level, and a draught of at full load. Displacement was standard and full load.<ref name="conways47p501"></ref> The ship was powered by four Rolls-Royce Olympus TBM3 gas turbines, with a maximum total continuous power of . These drove two propeller shafts via reversible gearboxes, giving a maximum speed of . The ship had a range of at .<ref name="hobbscomp125"/>
Invincibles flight deck was long and wide. It was connected to the ship's hangar by two lifts, with dimensions of &nbsp;× and rated to carry aircraft with a weight of . The hangar itself was long, with width varying between and a height of .<ref name="hobbscomp125"/> An upward-curved Ski-jump ramp at an angle of 6.5 degrees was fitted at the forward end of the ship's flight deck, this allowed the carrier's Sea Harriers to take off with a higher disposal payload, while shortening the take-off run, leaving more space for helicopter operations.<ref name="brownp69-0"></ref> The ship had a design air wing of 10 Westland Sea King anti-submarine helicopters and 8 British Aerospace Sea Harrier STOVL jet fighters.<ref name="jfs79p594"/>
As built, defensive armament consisted of a twin Sea Dart Surface to air missile launcher in the ship's bows.<ref name="conways47p501"/> 22 Sea Dart missiles were carried.<ref name="brownp68"></ref><ref name="cf86p180"></ref> A Type 1022 long-range air-search radar was mounted above the ship's bridge, with Type 909 fire control directors for the Sea Dart system mounted at the fore and aft end of the ship's superstructure. A Type 992 air-surface search radar was mounted on the ship's mainmast, while a Type 1006 navigation radar was also fitted. Type 184 medium range sonar was also fitted.<ref name="conways47p501"/><ref name="cf86p180-1"></ref>
===Modifications===
In September 1982, after returning from the Falklands War, Invincible had her close-in armament supplemented by two Phalanx CIWS and two Oerlikon 20 mm anti-aircraft autocannons.<ref name="hobbscompp126"></ref><ref name="jfs85p620"></ref> She underwent a major refit in 1986–1989, with several changes to increase the ship's efficiency in operating aircraft. The angle of the ship's ski-jump was increased to 12 degrees, with her hangar modified to allow more aircraft (nine Sea Harriers and twelve Sea Kings) to be accommodated below.<ref name="hobbscompp126"/><ref name="cf90p696"></ref>
The ship's overall length increased to . Additional command facilities were fitted and accommodation for another 120 people (aircrew and command staff) was added.<ref name="jfs02p770"></ref> The ship's magazines were enlarged, allowing Sea Eagle anti-ship missiles for the carrier's Sea Harriers to be carried, while also increasing the number of torpedoes carried for the ship's helicopters. Three Thales 30&nbsp;mm Goalkeeper CIWS replaced the Phalanxes. Type 996 air-sea search radar replaced the Type 992 radar, with Type 2016 sonar replaced the Type 184.<ref name="hobbscompp126"/><ref name="cf90p696"/> In 2000, Invincible was subject to further modifications to allow her to operate Harrier GR.7s in the ground-attack role. The Sea Dart launcher was removed, while the ship's flight deck was enlarged.<ref name="jfs02p770"/>
== History ==
Invincible was ordered from Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering on 17 April 1973, and was laid down at Vickers' Barrow-in-Furness on 17 April 1973. The ship's construction was delayed by design changes and industrial action, and Invincible was not launched until 3 May 1977.<ref name="jfs79p594"></ref> She was accepted into Royal Navy service on 19 March 1980 and after trials, formally commissioned on 11 July 1980. More trials and work-up followed for the ship and her air wing followed before she was declared operational on 19 June 1981,<ref name="hobbscomp125"></ref> joining the fleet's other carrier Hermes in service.
Invincibles initial air wing consisted of 801 Naval Air Squadron, equipped with five Sea Harriers and 820 Naval Air Squadron, equipped with Sea King anti-submarine helicopters.<ref name="faap130,98,393"></ref> In August–September 1981, Invicible took part in the NATO naval exercises "Ocean Venture" and "Ocean Safari".<ref name="hobbscomp125"/><ref></ref>
===Proposed sale and Falklands War===
On 25 February 1982, after several months of negotiations, the Australian government announced that it had agreed to buy Invincible for £175 million (285 million A$) as a replacement, under the name HMAS Australia, for the Royal Australian Navy's . Australia planned to make minimal changes to the carrier, adding more fuel and replacing some of the ship's computers. Initially at least, it was planned to operate helicopters only.<ref></ref><ref name="fi81528"></ref> The sale was confirmed by the Ministry of Defence.<ref></ref>
On 2 April 1982, however, Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. Three days later, a naval task force headed by Invincible and Hermes left HMNB Portsmouth bound for the South Atlantic. On 20 April, the UK government formally ordered its defence forces to bring the islands back under British control. Along with eight Sea Harriers, the Invincibles airgroup included twelve Sea King helicopters that were slightly larger than the ship had originally been designed to accommodate. Small machine guns were added around the flight deck and island for close-in defence.
On 23 April, while en route from Ascension Island to the Falklands, Invincible mistakenly locked her Sea Dart missile on a Varig DC-10 rather than on the Argentine Air Force Boeing 707 that had been monitoring the fleet's movements.<ref name="Freedman">Lawrence Freedman, Official History of the Falklands Campaign, Volume 2 , p.&nbsp;223–224.</ref> The previous day, Task Group Commander Sandy Woodward had sought permission from Commander-in-Chief Admiral Sir John Fieldhouse to shoot down the 707<ref name="Woodward">Sandy Woodward, One Hundred Days , p.&nbsp;143–145. The aircraft had been nicknamed "the Burglar". Woodward believed he had been given permission to shoot it down if came within a certain distance of the task force and could be positively identified, although this course of action had not been confirmed.</ref> as he believed its activity indicated a raid would be launched from the Argentine aircraft carrier ARA Veinticinco de Mayo. As the 707 would be no direct threat to the fleet, Woodward ordered Weapons Tight<ref name="Woodward"/> and the continued tracking of the aircraft's course while a Sea Harrier was dispatched to investigate. The Harrier pilot reported that "it was a Brazilian airliner, with all the normal navigation and running lights on." Details of the Harrier interception appeared in the Brazilian press along with the claim that the DC-10's passengers were "alleged to have been frightened" and Woodward's comment that "inconvenience to passengers' underwear regretted unless any of them were Argentinian".<ref name="Freedman"/>
On 30 May, two Super Étendards, one carrying Argentina's last remaining air-launched Exocet, escorted by four A-4C Skyhawks each with two 500lb bombs, took off to attack Invincible.<ref name="FreedmanUK)2005"></ref> Argentine intelligence had sought to determine the position of the carriers from analysis of aircraft flight routes from the task force to the islands.<ref name="FreedmanUK)2005"/> However, the British had a standing order that all aircraft conduct a low level transit when leaving or returning to the carriers to disguise their position.<ref name="Pook2008"></ref> This tactic compromised the Argentine attack, which focused on a group of escorts 40 miles south of the main body of ships.<ref name="Morgan2007"></ref> Two of the attacking Skyhawks<ref name="Morgan2007"/> were shot down by Sea Darts fired by ,<ref name="FreedmanUK)2005"/> with HMS Avenger claiming to have shot down the missile with her 4.5" gun (although this claim is disputed).<ref name="Southby-Tailyour2014"></ref> No damage was caused to any British vessels.<ref name="FreedmanUK)2005"/> During the war Argentina claimed to have damaged the ship and continues to do so to this day,<ref></ref> although no evidence of any such damage has been produced or uncovered.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
On 1 June, the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, advised the British government that the sale of Invincible to Australia could be cancelled if desired. In July 1983, a year after the end of the Falklands conflict,<ref>The UK formally declared an end to hostilities on 20 June 1982 .</ref> the Ministry of Defence announced that it had withdrawn its offer to sell Invincible so it could maintain a three-carrier force.<ref></ref>
===1983–2005===
In December 1983, 
Between 1993 and 1995, Invincible was deployed in the Adriatic for Operation Deny Flight and then Operation Deliberate Force during the Yugoslav Wars. In 1997, flying the flag of Rear-Admiral Alan West, Commander UK Task Group, Invincible led 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines. During the following two years, Invincible contributed to Operation "Bolton" (part of Operation Southern Watch) in southern Iraq before she was redeployed to the Balkans to support the NATO action against Yugoslavia over Kosovo.<ref></ref> There, while her helicopters aided refugees, her Harriers were involved in military strikes.
In 2003, Invincible featured in a skit of the BBC show Top Gear involving The Stig racing a white Jaguar XJS known as "The Top Gear Jag" on the deck in an attempt to reach 100&nbsp;mph and stop before the end of the runway. The attempt failed, resulting in The Stig and the Jaguar ending up in the sea. Jeremy Clarkson ended the show holding one of The Stig's gloves, claiming that it was all the salvage crew found of The Stig. The car was driven up to the ramp on the flight deck then on the following day the car was propelled off the ramp using a high pressure air rig. The vehicle was never recovered.
===2005–2011===
On 6 June 2005, the British Ministry of Defence announced that Invincible would be inactive until 2010 but available for reactivation at eighteen months' notice. She was decommissioned on 3 August 2005, twenty months after an extensive refit that had been intended to give her ten more years of service.<ref></ref> succeeded her as the service's flagship. The Royal Navy maintained that Invincible could have been deployed had the need arisen and that Navy policy assumed she was still an active aircraft carrier. According to Jane's, however, Invincible had been stripped of some parts for her sister ships, so operational readiness would require not only eighteen months but also the replacement or removal of systems from those other ships.
In March 2010, Invincible was tied up and minimally maintained with other decommissioned ships up-river of HMNB Portsmouth. On 10 September 2010, she was struck off the Naval Reserve List<ref name="reserve"> urltoken North West Evening Mail Barrow-built Invincible thrown out of the Navy</ref> and, in December, offered for sale by the Disposal Services Authority (DSA) with tenders due by 5 January 2011.<ref name="sale"></ref><ref></ref> The DSA tender documents confirmed that the ship's engines had been removed and that its generators and pumps were "generally unserviceable or not working".<ref name="sale"/> On 8 January 2011, the British press relayed an earlier report in the South China Morning Post that a £5-million bid had been made for the ship by the UK-based Chinese businessman Lam Kin-bong with plans to moor her at Zhuhai or Liverpool as a floating international school. In light, however, of China's re-arming of the Varyagbought under a similar pretextand the EU arms embargo on China, doubts were raised as to whether such a sale would go ahead.<ref></ref>
A month later, in February 2011, BBC News reported that the Ministry of Defence had announced the sale of Invincible to Leyal Ship Recycling in Turkey. She was towed out of Portsmouth on 24 March<ref></ref> and arrived at Leyal's Aliağa yard on 12 April 2011 for scrapping.<ref></ref>
== Weapons and aircraft ==
Invincible initially lacked any close-in weapon systems. As one of the lessons from the Falklands War Invincible had two 20&nbsp;mm Raytheon Phalanx CIWS fitted but these were later replaced by three Thales 30&nbsp;mm Goalkeeper CIWS; there are also two Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. Countermeasures were provided by a Thales jamming system and ECM system, Seagnat launchers provide for chaff or flare decoys. Initially the carriers were armed with a Sea Dart SAM missile system, but this was removed to enlarge the flight deck and to allow magazine storage and deck space for Royal Air Force Harrier GR7s.
After the various refits, the carrier's air group grew from the original planned 5 Sea Harriers and 9 Sea Kings to nine Sea Harrier or Harrier GR7/9s and twelve helicopters (usually all Sea Kings, either Anti-submarine warfare or Airborne Early Warning variants). Alternative airgroups were occasionally tested with 16 Harriers and 3 helicopters being embarked. The carrier was equipped with flagship facilities and could provide an operational headquarters for Royal Navy task forces. The runway was long and included the ship's characteristic ski jump (initially at an angle of 7°, but later increased to 12°).

HMS Invincible was the Royal Navy's lead ship of her class of three light aircraft carriers. She was launched on 3 May 1977 as the seventh ship to carry the name. She was originally designated as an anti-submarine warfare carrier, but was used as an aircraft carrier during the Falklands War, when she was deployed with . She took over as flagship of the British fleet when Hermes was sold to India. Invincible was also deployed in the Yugoslav Wars and the Iraq War. In 2005, she was decommissioned, and was eventually sold for scrap in February 2011.<ref name=BBC_HMS_Invincible_sold></ref>
