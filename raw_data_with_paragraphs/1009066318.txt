Dennis Prager

==Political views==
In 1994 the Anti-Defamation League published a report on antisemitism in the Christian right movement; Prager, who aligned with the social and political conservatism of the Christian right, attacked the ADL and its report.<ref></ref> In 1995 he urged conservative Jews to be open to working with conservative Christians, like the Christian Coalition.<ref></ref> In 1995 he named Jacob Petuchowski, Eliezer Berkovits, Harold Kushner, C.S. Lewis, Richard John Neuhaus, Michael Novak, and George Gilder as the people who had influenced his theology the most.<ref></ref>
In 1995 Prager criticized the Illinois Supreme Court decision in the Baby Richard case that removed a child from his adoptive parents.<ref></ref> With KABC he held a "Rally for Baby Richard",<ref></ref> where he got support from actors Priscilla Presley, Tom Selleck, and John McCook.<ref name=larg></ref>
In 1996 Prager testified in Congress in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act. Prager testified that "the acceptance of homosexuality as the equal of heterosexual marital love signifies the decline of Western civilization."<ref></ref> Prager worked with Bob Dole's campaign in the 1996 presidential election; when polls prior to the election showed that the Dole campaign did not have much Jewish support, Prager said this was because "American Jews are ignorant regarding the anti Israel aspects of the current Democrat Party."<ref></ref>
Since 1999, he has hosted a nationally syndicated talk show on the socially and politically conservative Christian radio station KRLA in Los Angeles.<ref name="KareshHurvitz2006" /> KRLA is part of the Salem Media Group that carries other conservative hosts, including James Dobson, Randall Terry, Janet Parshall, Sebastian Gorka and Larry Elder; it is a key voice of the Christian right that seeks to change American politics as well as the way that individual people live.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
In 2003, he considered running for the US Senate against Barbara Boxer in the 2004 election.<ref></ref>
In 2006, Prager criticized Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, for announcing that he would Quran oath controversy of the 110th United States Congress.<ref name="MNmonitorVsPrager"></ref> Prager wrote: "Insofar as a member of Congress taking an oath to serve America and uphold its values is concerned, America is interested in only one book, the Bible. If you are incapable of taking an oath on that book, don't serve in Congress." In response, former New York City Mayor Ed Koch called for Prager to end his service on the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Council.<ref></ref>
In 2009 Prager joined other Salem Radio Network hosts to oppose the Affordable Care Act.<ref></ref> In 2014, while same-sex marriage in the United States was in process of being legalized, he wrote that if that were to happen, then "there is no plausible argument for denying polygamous relationships, or brothers and sisters, or parents and adult children, the right to marry."<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3" /> In 2014, he also said that the "heterosexual AIDS" crisis was something "entirely manufactured by the Left".<ref name=":3"></ref>
Prager endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, but said that Trump was his "17th choice out of 17 candidates". He clarified that he "was not a Trump supporter, when there was a choice" but added, "There is no choice now."<ref name=":5"></ref> Prager had previously said that Trump was "unfit to be a presidential candidate, let alone president".<ref name=buzzfeed></ref> Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic described how Trump's adultery, character assassination of others, embrace of torture, bad behavior, whining, and use of profanity violate values and principles that Prager has upheld as essential to civil life and noted that Prager had said that endorsing Trump was in line with his principles because "we hold that defeating Hillary Clinton, the Democrats, and the Left is also a principle. And that it is the greater principle". Friedersdorf wrote, "If that's all principle means now, we haven't much need for public moralists to write weekly columns with appeals to Judeo-Christian ethics and the importance of good character. Just pick the political party you like best and let the ends justify the means on its behalf."<ref name=":2"></ref>
In 2017, Prager was invited to be a guest conductor for the volunteer orchestra of Santa Monica, California, as part of a fundraising concert at the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Some of the orchestra members protested the invitation, which they considered promoting bigotry. The orchestra leader had invited Prager because he admired him, as Prager often discussed and promoted classical music on his shows and had guest-conducted a few times in the past, and because he thought Prager's presence might help raise more money.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":1"></ref> Guido Lamell, music director of the Santa Monica Symphony, in spite of the controversy surrounding Prager's presence, called Prager "a great man, leader and friend".<ref></ref>
In February 2020, he told a caller: "Of course you should never call anybody the n-word, that's despicable," but complained about the word itself being considered unacceptable.<ref></ref><ref></ref> In April 2020, Prager said of social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, "The lockdown is the greatest mistake in the Human history."<ref></ref><ref></ref> He was subsequently criticized in the media for misrepresenting the seriousness of the pandemic.<ref></ref>
== PragerU ==
In 2009, Prager and his producer Allen Estrin started a website called PragerU, which creates five-minute videos on various topics from a conservative perspective.<ref></ref><ref></ref> According to Prager, he created the site to challenge the "unhealthy effect intellectually and morally" of the American higher education system.<ref></ref> BuzzFeed described PragerU as "one of the biggest, most influential and yet least understood forces in online media." it spent around 40% of its annual $10 million budget on marketing; each video is produced according to a consistent style. Videos cover topics such as "racism, sexism, income inequality, gun ownership, Islam, immigration, Israel, police brutality" and speech on college campuses. BuzzFeed wrote that "the biggest reason PragerU has escaped national attention is that it mostly doesn't do Trump," or engage with the political news cycle.<ref name=buzzfeed/> Some of its videos had restricted viewer access by YouTube in 2017.<ref></ref>
