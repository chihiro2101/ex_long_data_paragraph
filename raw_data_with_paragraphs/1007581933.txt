Aortic stenosis

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms related to aortic stenosis depend on the degree of stenosis. Most people with mild to moderate aortic stenosis do not have symptoms. Symptoms usually present in individuals with severe aortic stenosis, though they may also occur in those with mild to moderate aortic stenosis. The three main symptoms of aortic stenosis are Syncope (medicine), anginal chest pain and exertional dyspnea or other symptoms of heart failure such as orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or pedal edema.<ref name="Asymptomatic"/><ref name="Thoughts"/> It may also be accompanied by the characteristic "Dresden china" appearance of pallor with a light flush.<ref></ref>
===Angina===
Angina in setting of heart failure also increases the risk of death. In people with angina, the 5-year mortality rate is 50% if the aortic valve is not replaced.
Angina in the setting of AS occurs due to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) that is caused by the constant production of increased pressure required to overcome the pressure gradient caused by the AS. While the myocardium of the left ventricle thickens, the arteries that supply the muscle do not get significantly longer or bigger, so the muscle may not receive enough blood supply to meet its oxygen requirement. This ischemia may first be evident during exercise when the heart muscle requires increased blood supply to compensate for the increased workload. The individual may complain of anginal chest pain with exertion. At this stage, a cardiac stress test with imaging may be suggestive of ischemia.
Eventually, however, the heart muscle will require more blood supply at rest than can be supplied by the coronary artery branches. At this point there may be signs of ventricular strain pattern (ST segment depression and T wave inversion) on the EKG, suggesting subendocardial ischemia. The subendocardium is the region that is most susceptible to ischemia because it is the most distant from the epicardial coronary arteries.
===Syncope===
Syncope (fainting spells) from aortic valve stenosis is usually exertional.<ref name="Asymptomatic"/><ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1>Chapter 1: Diseases of the Cardiovascular system > Section: Valvular Heart Disease in: </ref> In the setting of heart failure it increases the risk of death. In people with syncope, the three-year mortality rate is 50% if the aortic valve is not replaced.<ref></ref>
It is unclear why aortic stenosis causes syncope. One theory is that severe AS produces a nearly fixed cardiac output.<ref></ref> When a person with aortic stenosis exercises, their peripheral vascular resistance will decrease as the blood vessels of the skeletal muscles dilate to allow the muscles to receive more blood to allow them to do more work. This decrease in peripheral vascular resistance is normally compensated for by an increase in the cardiac output. Since people with severe AS cannot increase their cardiac output, the blood pressure falls and the person will faint due to decreased blood perfusion to the brain.
A second theory is that during exercise the high pressures generated in the hypertrophied left ventricle cause a vasodepressor response, which causes a secondary peripheral vasodilation that, in turn, causes decreased blood flow to the brain resulting in loss of consciousness. Indeed, in aortic stenosis, because of the fixed obstruction to blood flow out from the heart, it may be impossible for the heart to increase its output to offset peripheral vasodilation.
A third mechanism may sometimes be operative. Due to the hypertrophy of the left ventricle in aortic stenosis, including the consequent inability of the coronary arteries to adequately supply blood to the myocardium (see "Angina" below), arrhythmias may develop. These can lead to syncope.
Finally, in calcific aortic stenosis<ref name=":0" /><ref></ref> at least, the calcification in and around the aortic valve can progress and extend to involve the electrical conduction system of the heart. If that occurs, the result may be heart block, a potentially lethal condition of which syncope may be a symptom.
===Congestive heart failure===
Congestive heart failure (CHF) carries a grave prognosis in people with AS. People with CHF attributable to AS have a 2-year mortality rate of 50% if the aortic valve is not replaced. CHF in the setting of AS is due to a combination of left ventricular hypertrophy with fibrosis, systolic dysfunction (a decrease in the ejection fraction) and diastolic dysfunction (elevated filling pressure of the LV).<ref name="Asymptomatic"/>
===Associated symptoms===
In Heyde's syndrome, aortic stenosis is associated with gastrointestinal bleeding due to angiodysplasia of the colon.<ref name="Heyde's"></ref> Recent research has shown that the stenosis causes a form of von Willebrand disease by breaking down its associated coagulation factor (factor VIII-associated antigen, also called von Willebrand factor),<ref></ref> due to increased turbulence around the stenotic valve.
===Complications===
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the American Heart Association has recently changed its recommendations regarding antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis. Specifically, as of 2007 it is recommended that such prophylaxis should be limited only to those with prosthetic heart valves, those with previous episode(s) of endocarditis, and those with certain types of congenital heart disease.
Since the stenosed aortic valve may limit the heart's output, people with aortic stenosis are at risk of syncope and dangerously low blood pressure should they use any of a number of medications for cardiovascular diseases that often coexist with aortic stenosis. Examples include nitroglycerin, nitrates, ACE inhibitors, terazosin (Hytrin), and hydralazine. Note that all of these substances lead to peripheral vasodilation. Under normal circumstances, in the absence of aortic stenosis, the heart is able to increase its output and thereby offset the effect of the dilated blood vessels. In some cases of aortic stenosis, however, due to the obstruction of blood flow out of the heart caused by the stenosed aortic valve, cardiac output cannot be increased. Low blood pressure or syncope may ensue.
==Causes==
Aortic stenosis is most commonly caused by age-related progressive calcification (>50% of cases), with a mean age of 65 to 70 years. Another major cause of aortic stenosis is the calcification of a congenital bicuspid aortic valve or, more rarely, congenital unicuspid aortic valve. Those with unicuspid aortic valve typically need intervention when very young, often as a newborn. While those with congenital bicuspid aortic valve make up 30-40% of those presenting during adulthood and <ref> urltoken Ricardo Zalaquett, Cristóbal Camplá, et al. (2005). "Cirugía reparadora de la válvula aórtica bicúspide insuficiente". Rev Méd Chile, 133(3): pp. 279-86. ISSN 0034-9887.</ref> typically presenting earlier (ages 40+ to 50+) than those with tricuspid aortic valves (65+).<ref name="Thoughts"/>
Acute rheumatic fever post-inflammatory is the cause of less than 10% of cases.<ref name=uas>VOC=VITIUM ORGANICUM CORDIS, a compendium of the Department of Cardiology at Uppsala Academic Hospital. By Per Kvidal September 1999, with revision by Erik Björklund May 2008</ref> Rare causes of aortic stenosis include Fabry disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, Paget disease, hyperuricemia, and infection.<ref name="Rare"></ref>
==Pathophysiology==
The human aortic valve normally consists of three cusps or leaflets and has an opening of 3.0-4.0 square centimeters.<ref name="Cellular"/><ref name="Rare"/> When the left ventricle contracts, it forces blood through the valve into the aorta and subsequently to the rest of the body. When the left ventricle expands again, the aortic valve closes and prevents the blood in the aorta from flowing backward (regurgitation) into the left ventricle. In aortic stenosis, the opening of the aortic valve becomes narrowed or constricted (stenosis) (e.g., due to calcification). Degenerative (the most common variety), and bicuspid aortic stenosis both begin with damage to endothelial cells from increased mechanical stress.<ref name="Thoughts"></ref><ref name="Rare"/> Inflammation is thought to be involved in the earlier stages of the pathogenesis of AS and its associated risk factors are known to promote the deposition of LDL cholesterol and lipoprotein(a), a highly damaging substance, into the aortic valve, causing significant damage and stenosis over time.<ref name="Thoughts"/><ref name="Rare"/>
As a consequence of this stenosis, the left ventricle must generate a higher pressure with each contraction to effectively move blood forward into the aorta.<ref name="Asymptomatic"/><ref name=Lilly></ref> Initially, the LV generates this increased pressure by thickening its muscular walls (myocardial hypertrophy). The type of hypertrophy most commonly seen in AS is known as concentric hypertrophy,<ref name="Asymptomatic"/> in which the walls of the LV are (approximately) equally thickened.
In the later stages, the left ventricle dilates, the wall thins, and the systolic function deteriorates (resulting in impaired ability to pump blood forward). Morris and Innasimuthu et al. showed that different coronary anatomy is associated with different valve diseases. Research was in progress in 2010 to see if different coronary anatomy might lead to turbulent flow at the level of valves leading to inflammation and degeneration.<ref>G.

==Diagnosis==

Aortic stenosis is most often diagnosed when it is asymptomatic and can sometimes be detected during routine examination of the heart and circulatory system. Good evidence exists to demonstrate that certain characteristics of the peripheral pulse can rule in the diagnosis.<ref name=Etchells/> In particular, there may be a slow and/or sustained upstroke of the arterial pulse, and the pulse may be of low volume. This is sometimes referred to as pulsus parvus et tardus.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/><ref name=uas/> There may also be a noticeable delay between the heart sounds (on auscultation) and the corresponding pulse in the carotid artery (so-called 'apical-carotid delay'). In a similar manner, there may be a delay between the appearance of each pulse in the brachial artery (in the arm) and the radial artery (in the wrist).
The first heart sound may be followed by a sharp ejection sound ("ejection click") best heard at the lower left sternal border and the apex, and, thus, appear to be "split". The ejection sound, caused by the impact of left ventricular outflow against the partially fused aortic valve leaflets, is more commonly associated with a mobile bicuspid aortic valve than an immobile calcified aortic valve. The intensity of this sound does not vary with respiration, which helps distinguish it from the ejection click produced by a stenotic pulmonary valve, which will diminish slightly in intensity during inspiration.<ref name=Lilly36></ref>
An easily heard systolic, crescendo-decrescendo (i.e., 'ejection') murmur is heard loudest at the upper right sternal border, at the 2nd right intercostal space,<ref name=uas/> and radiates to the carotid artery bilaterally.<ref name="Asymptomatic"/><ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> The murmur increases with squatting and decreases with standing and isometric muscular contraction such as the Valsalva maneuver, which helps distinguish it from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). The murmur is louder during expiration but is also easily heard during inspiration. The more severe the degree of the stenosis, the later the peak occurs in the crescendo-decrescendo of the murmur.
The second heart sound (A<sub>2</sub>) tends to become decreased and softer as the aortic stenosis becomes more severe.<ref name=uas/> This is a result of the increasing calcification of the valve preventing it from "snapping" shut and producing a sharp, loud sound. Due to increases in left ventricular pressure from the stenotic aortic valve, over time the ventricle may hypertrophy, resulting in a diastolic dysfunction. As a result, there may be a fourth heart sound due to the stiff ventricle.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> With continued increases in ventricular pressure, dilatation of the ventricle will occur, and a third heart sound may be manifest.
Finally, aortic stenosis often co-exists with some degree of aortic insufficiency (aortic regurgitation). Hence, the physical exam in aortic stenosis may also reveal signs of the latter, for example, an early diastolic decrescendo murmur. Indeed, when both valve abnormalities are present, the expected findings of either may be modified or may not even be present. Rather, new signs that reflect the presence of simultaneous aortic stenosis and insufficiency, e.g., pulsus bisferiens, emerge.
According to a meta-analysis, the most useful findings for ruling in aortic stenosis in the clinical setting were slow rate of rise of the carotid pulse (positive likelihood ratio ranged 2.8–130 across studies), mid to late peak intensity of the murmur (positive likelihood ratio, 8.0–101), and decreased intensity of the second heart sound (positive likelihood ratio, 3.1–50).<ref name=Etchells></ref>
Other peripheral signs include:
* sustained, heaving apex beat,<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> which is not displaced unless systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle has developed
* A precordial thrill<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>
* narrowed pulse pressure
===Electrocardiogram===
Although aortic stenosis does not lead to any specific findings on the electrocardiogram (ECG), it still often leads to a number of electrocardiographic abnormalities. ECG manifestations of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are common in aortic stenosis<ref name="Thoughts"/><ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> and arise as a result of the stenosis having placed a chronically high pressure load on the left ventricle (with LVH being the expected response to chronic pressure loads on the left ventricle no matter what the cause).
As noted above, the calcification process that occurs in aortic stenosis can progress to extend beyond the aortic valve and into the electrical conduction system of the heart. Evidence of this phenomenon may rarely include ECG patterns characteristic of certain types of heart block such as Left bundle branch block.<ref name="Thoughts"/>
===Heart catheterization===
Cardiac chamber catheterization provides a definitive diagnosis, indicating severe stenosis in valve area of <1.0&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> (normally about 3&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>).<ref> urltoken Yale atlas of echocardiography </ref> It can directly measure the pressure on both sides of the aortic valve. The pressure gradient may be used as a decision point for treatment. It is useful in symptomatic people before surgery.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> The standard for diagnosis of aortic stenosis is non-invasive testing with echocardiography. Cardiac catheterization is reserved for cases in which there is discrepancy between the clinical picture and non-invasive testing, due to risks inherent to crossing the aortic valve, such as stroke.<ref name="Thoughts"/>
===Echocardiogram===

Aortic stenosis (AS or AoS) is the stenosis of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins), such that problems result.<ref name=Cz2014/> It may occur at the aortic valve as well as above and below this level.<ref name=Cz2014/> It typically gets worse over time.<ref name=Cz2014/> Symptoms often come on gradually with a decreased ability to exercise often occurring first.<ref name=Cz2014/> If heart failure, Syncope (medicine), or angina occur due to AS the outcomes are worse.<ref name=Cz2014/> Loss of consciousness typically occurs with standing or exercising.<ref name=Cz2014/> Signs of heart failure include shortness of breath especially when orthopnea, at night, or with exercise, and peripheral edema.<ref name=Cz2014/> Thickening of the valve without narrowing is known as aortic sclerosis.<ref name=Cz2014/>
Causes include being born with a bicuspid aortic valve, and rheumatic fever; a normal valve may also harden over the decades.<ref name=Cz2014/> A bicuspid aortic valve affects about one to two percent of the population.<ref name=Cz2014/> As of 2014 rheumatic heart disease mostly occurs in the developing world.<ref name=Cz2014/> Risk factors are similar to those of coronary artery disease and include smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, and being male.<ref name=Cz2014/> The aortic valve usually has three leaflets and is located between the left ventricle of the heart, and the aorta.<ref name=Cz2014/> AS typically results in a heart murmur.<ref name=Cz2014/> Its severity can be divided into mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, distinguishable by echocardiogram.<ref name=Cz2014/>
Aortic stenosis is typically followed using repeated ultrasound scans.<ref name=Cz2014/> Once it has become severe, treatment primarily involves valve replacement surgery, with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) being an option in some who are at high risk from surgery.<ref name=Cz2014/> Valves may either be mechanical or bioprosthetic, with each having risks and benefits.<ref name=Cz2014/> Another less invasive procedure, balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV), may result in benefit, but for only a few months.<ref name=Cz2014/> Complications such as heart failure may be treated in the same way as in those with mild to moderate AS.<ref name=Cz2014/> In those with severe disease a number of medications should be avoided, including ACE inhibitors, nitroglycerin, and some beta blockers.<ref name=Cz2014/> Nitroprusside or phenylephrine may be used in those with decompensated heart failure depending on the blood pressure.<ref name=Cz2014/><ref name=Over2008></ref>
Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease in the developed world.<ref name="Asymptomatic"></ref> It affects about 2% of people who are over 65 years of age.<ref name=Cz2014></ref> Estimated rates were not known in most of the developing world as of 2014.<ref></ref> In those who have symptoms, without repair the chance of death at five years is about 50% and at 10 years is about 90%.<ref name=Cz2014/> Aortic stenosis was first described by French physician Lazare Rivière in 1663.<ref name="Cellular"></ref>
