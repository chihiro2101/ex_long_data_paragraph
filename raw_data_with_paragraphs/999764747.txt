List of world records in chess

==Game length records==
===Longest game===
The longest tournament chess game (in terms of moves) ever to be played was Nikolić–Arsović, Belgrade 1989, which lasted for 269 moves and took 20 hours and 15 minutes to complete a drawn game.<ref></ref><ref name="Krabbé Chess records"></ref> At the time this game was played, FIDE had modified the fifty-move rule to allow 100 moves to be played without a piece being captured in a rook and bishop versus rook endgame, the situation in Nikolić versus Arsović. FIDE has since rescinded that modification to the rule.
The longest decisive tournament game is Danin–Azarov, Turnov 2016, which Danin won in 239 moves.<ref name="Chess database"></ref> In the 9th round of THT Extraliga (highest Czech team league), Danin needed to win his game to make the match end in a 4:4 draw. Although he managed to do so, his team (TŽ Třinec) was relegated from the highest league in the end.
The second longest decisive tournament game is Fressinet–Kosteniuk, Villandry 2007, which Kosteniuk won in 237 moves.<ref name="Krabbé Chess records" /><ref></ref> The last 116 moves were a rook and bishop versus rook ending, as in Nikolić – Arsović. Fressinet could have claimed a draw under the fifty-move rule, but did not do so since neither player was keeping score, it being a rapid chess game. Earlier in the tournament, Korchnoi had successfully invoked the rule to claim a draw against Fressinet; the arbiters overruled Fressinet's argument that Korchnoi could not do so without keeping score. Fressinet, apparently wanting to be consistent, did not try to claim a draw against Kosteniuk in the same situation.<ref></ref>
The longest game played in a world championship is the fifth game of the 1978 match between Viktor Korchnoi and Anatoly Karpov.<ref></ref> Korchnoi's 124th move, as White, produced stalemate.
===Shortest game===
====Shortest decisive game====
The fewest moves required to deliver checkmate in chess is two, in what is known as Fool's mate (1.g4 e5 2.f3 Qh4 and variants thereof). This has been known to occur in amateur play. Chessgames.com gives a game L. Darling–R. Wood, 1983, that was published on April Fool's Day in Northwest Chess magazine (1.g4 e6 2.f4?? Qh4#).<ref></ref> Bill Wall lists, in addition to Darling–Wood, three other games that ended with Black checkmating on the second move.<ref> urltoken Miniatures. Retrieved on January 4, 2009.</ref> In a tournament game at odds of , White delivered checkmate on move 2: W. Cooke–"R____g", Cape Town Chess Club handicap tournament 1908 (remove Black's f-pawn) 1.e4 g5?? 2.Qh5#.<ref>Edward Winter, urltoken Chess Note 5858 .</ref> The same game had previously been played in Leeky–Mason, Dublin 1867.<ref></ref>
If one counts forfeited games as a loss in zero moves,<ref>It counts as a loss for tournament score, but not for rating calculations where a forfeit is treated as an unplayed game.</ref> then there have been many such forfeits, the most notable examples being Game 2 of the World Chess Championship 1972 between Boris Spassky and Bobby Fischer, which Fischer defaulted,<ref></ref> and Game 5 of the 2006 world championship match between Vladimir Kramnik and Veselin Topalov, which Kramnik defaulted.<ref>Chess Informant, Volume 98, Šahovski Informator, 2007, p. 295.</ref> 
Under recently instituted FIDE rules, a player who is late for the beginning of a round loses the game, as does a player who has a forbidden electronic device (by default any device). The former rule was used at the 2009 Chinese Championship to forfeit Hou Yifan for arriving five seconds late for the beginning of a round.<ref> urltoken New rule. Good or bad? You decide. susanpolgar.blogspot.com. Retrieved on October 25, 2009.</ref> The latter rule was used to forfeit Aleksander Delchev against Stuart Conquest after the move 1.d4 in the 2009 European Team Championship.<ref></ref>
The German grandmaster Robert Hübner also lost a game without playing any moves. In a World Student Team Championship game played in Graz in 1972, Hübner played one move and offered a draw to Kenneth Rogoff, who accepted. However, the arbiters insisted that some moves be played, so the players played the following ridiculous game: 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nf3 g6 3.Ng1 Bg7 4.Qa4 0-0 5.Qxd7 Qxd7 6.g4 Qxd2+ 7.Kxd2 Nxg4 8.b4 a5 9.a4 Bxa1 10.Bb2 Nc6 11.Bh8 Bg7 12.h4 axb4 (draw agreed).<ref></ref> The arbiters ruled that both players must apologize and play an actual game at 7 p.m. Rogoff appeared and apologized; Hübner did neither. Hübner's clock was started, and after an hour Rogoff was declared the winner.<ref></ref> Wang Chen and Lu Shanglei both lost a game in which they had played no moves. They agreed to a draw without play at the 2009 Zhejiang Lishui Xingqiu Cup International Open Chess Tournament held in Lishui, Zhejiang Province, China. The chief arbiter declared both players to have lost the game.<ref>Susan Polgar Daily Chess News and Information, urltoken Double forfeit (based on Polgar's translation of Chinese-language urltoken Sina Sports , published September 21, 2009). Retrieved on 2009-09-29.</ref>
More rarely, a player might decide to protest by resigning a game rather than forfeiting. A game between Fischer and Oscar Panno, played at the Palma de Mallorca Interzonal 1970, went: 1.c4 Black resigns. Panno refused to play to protest the organizers' rescheduling of the game to accommodate Fischer's desire not to play on his religion's Shabbat. Panno was not present when the game was to begin. Fischer waited ten minutes before making his move and went to get Panno to convince him to play. Fifty-two minutes had elapsed on Panno's clock before he came to the board and resigned.<ref></ref><ref></ref> (At the time, an absence of sixty minutes resulted in a forfeit.)<ref></ref> 
The shortest decisive tournament game that was decided because of the position on the board (i.e. not because of a forfeit or protest) is Z. Đorđević–M. Kovačević, Bela Crkva 1984. It lasted only three moves (1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 c6 3.e3 Qa5+ winning the bishop), and White resigned.<ref name="Krabbé Chess records"/><ref></ref><ref></ref> This was repeated in Vassallo–Gamundi, Salamanca 1998.<ref name="Krabbé Chess records"/> (In a number of other games, White has played on after 3.Qa5+, occasionally drawing<ref>Tim Krabbé, urltoken Entry No. 257 . Retrieved on May 4, 2009.</ref> or even winning<ref></ref> in this line.) The shortest game ever lost by a grandmaster because of the position on the board was by future world champion Viswanathan Anand, who resigned on move 6 against Alonso Zapata in 1988 (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.Nc3 Bf5?? 6.Qe2 winning a piece, since 6.Qe7 is answered by 7.Nd5 Qe6 8.Nxc7+).<ref name="Barden2017"></ref><ref></ref>
====Shortest draw====
A game may be drawn by mutual agreement in any number of moves. Traditionally, it has been common for players to agree to a "grandmaster draw" after playing about 10–15 moves of known opening theory and making no serious effort to win. This is usually done to preserve energy in a tournament, after a devastating loss in the previous round of the tournament, or in the final round when no prize money is at stake. There has been some debate over the ethics of the practice, and recently there has been a trend away from such games, with many tournaments adopting measures to discourage short draws. If the tournament officials (unlike those at Graz and Lishui) do not object, a game may even be agreed drawn without a single move being played. According to ChessGames.com, in the 1968 Skopje–Ohrid tournament Dragoljub Janosevic and Efim Geller agreed to a draw without playing any moves.<ref></ref> Tony Miles and Stewart Reuben did the same thing in the last round of the Luton 1975 tournament, "with the blessing of the controller", in order to assure themselves of first and second places respectively.<ref name="Whyld 1986 124"></ref><ref></ref>
====Shortest World Championship game====
As mentioned above, Fischer (in 1972) and Kramnik (in 2006) each forfeited a world championship game without playing any moves. Other than those unplayed games, the shortest game in a world championship was the 21st match game in the World Chess Championship 1963 between Mikhail Botvinnik and Tigran Petrosian. The players agreed to a draw after the 10th move by White (Petrosian).<ref></ref> The shortest decisive, non-forfeited world championship game occurred between Viswanathan Anand and Boris Gelfand in game 8 of the World Chess Championship 2012. Gelfand resigned after Anand's 17th move, 17.Qf2.<ref></ref>
====Shortest stalemate====
The shortest known stalemate, composed by Sam Loyd, involves the sequence 1.e3 a5 2.Qh5 Ra6 3.Qxa5 h5 4.Qxc7 Rah6 5.h4 f6 6.Qxd7+ Kf7 7.Qxb7 Qd3 8.Qxb8 Qh7 9.Qxc8 Kg6 10.Qe6 (diagram). The shortest stalemate with all of the pieces on the board, composed by Charles H Wheeler,<ref></ref> occurs after 1.d4 d6 2.Qd2 e5 3.a4 e4 4.Qf4 f5 5.h3 Be7 6.Qh2 Be6 7.Ra3 c5 8.Rg3 Qa5+ 9.Nd2 Bh4 10.f3 Bb3 11.d5 e3 12.c4 f4 (minor variations are possible). These games are nonsensical from the point of view of chess strategy, but both have occasionally been played in tournaments as a joke, as part of a prearranged draw.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The shortest known route to a position where both players are stalemated, discovered by Enzo Minerva and published in the Italian newspaper l'Unità on August 14, 2007, is 1.c4 d5 2.Qb3 Bh3 3.gxh3 f5 4.Qxb7 Kf7 5.Qxa7 Kg6 6.f3 c5 7.Qxe7 Rxa2 8.Kf2 Rxb2 9.Qxg7+ Kh5 10.Qxg8 Rxb1 11.Rxb1 Kh4 12.Qxh8 h5 13.Qh6 Bxh6 14.Rxb8 Be3+ 15.dxe3 Qxb8 16.Kg2 Qf4 17.exf4 d4 18.Be3 dxe3. The shortest genuine stalemate in a serious game was played in Ravenna 1982, when the Italian master Mario Sibilio forced a stalemate on move 27 against grandmaster Sergio Mariotti.<ref> urltoken Sibilio vs. Mariotti, Ravenna 1982 .

==Game play records==
===Latest first capture===
In Rogoff–Williams, World Junior Chess Championship, Stockholm 1969, the first capture (94.bxc5) occurred on White's 94th move.<ref name="Krabbé Chess records"/><ref></ref> Filipowicz–Smederevac, Polanica Zdroj 1966, was drawn in 70 moves under the fifty-move rule, without any piece or pawn having been captured.<ref name="Whyld 1986 124"/><ref></ref>
====Latest first capture in a decisive game====
Nuber–Keckeisen, Mengen 1994 lasted 31 moves without a single capture. In the end Keckeisen, facing imminent checkmate, resigned.<ref></ref>
 
In the decisive game Yates–Znosko-Borovsky, Tunbridge Wells 1927, the first capture occurred on move 40.<ref>The game appears in "The Game of Chess" by Harry Golombek, Penguin Books, first published 1954, on page 119.

===Most grandmasters===
Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia has continued to hold the record for greatest number of grandmasters. In the November 2018 rating list, 229 of the 1645 grandmasters were from Russia.
===Greatest concentration of resident grandmasters===
In 2005, Reykjavík, Iceland, with eight grandmasters (Jón L. Árnason, Jóhann Hjartarson, Margeir Pétursson, Friðrik Ólafsson, Thröstur Thórhallsson, Helgi Grétarsson, Hannes Stefansson, and Bobby Fischer) had a higher percentage of resident grandmasters per capita than any other city worldwide;<ref></ref> the city of 114,000<ref></ref> had, therefore, one grandmaster per 14,000 residents.
===Most rated players===
As of November 2018, Germany has the highest number of active FIDE-rated players with 11,813. Russia, by comparison, has 11,313.<ref></ref>

==Tournament records==
===Perfect tournament and match scores===
In top-class chess it is rare for a player to complete a tournament or match with a 100 percent score. Some notable examples are:

==Playing records==
===Consecutive wins against masters===
Bobby Fischer won 20 consecutive games, all in competitions at late stages of the world championship cycle. (Some commentators give this as 19, not counting Fischer's game against Oscar Panno, who resigned after Fischer's first move as a protest). Fischer won his last seven games at the 1970 Palma de Mallorca Interzonal (including the one-move game against Panno), then swept Mark Taimanov 6–0 in the quarterfinals followed by Bent Larsen by the same score in the semifinals. In the Candidates Match final, Fischer beat former World Champion Tigran Petrosian in the first game before Petrosian snapped the streak by winning the second match game.<ref></ref>
Wilhelm Steinitz won his last 16 games at Vienna 1873, including a two-game playoff against Joseph Henry Blackburne at the end. He played no serious chess until an 1876 match against Blackburne that Steinitz swept 7–0. After a long period of inactivity, Steinitz played at Vienna 1882, where he won his first two games before finally ending his winning streak with a draw. Steinitz's 25-game winning streak over nine years has never been equaled.<ref></ref>
===Longest unbeaten streak===
The longest confirmed unbeaten streak at elite level belongs to Magnus Carlsen,<ref></ref> who achieved an unbeaten streak of 125 games in the classical time format. His streak started after a loss on July 31, 2018 in the Biel tournament against Shakhriyar Mamedyarov.<ref></ref> His streak was stopped by Jan-Krzysztof Duda on October 10, 2020, when he lost a game in the Norway Chess.<ref> urltoken Round 5 of the 2020 Altibox Norway Chess Tournament: Jan-Krzysztof Duda vs Magnus Carlsen.</ref> The streak consists of 42 wins and 83 draws.

Bogdan Lalić's unbeaten streak of 155 games<ref></ref> (against less elite players than those Carlsen faced) is pending confirmation.
===Most world champions defeated===
This includes games against players who were not yet or were no longer world champion at the time of the game. 
Paul Keres, Viktor Korchnoi, and Alexander Beliavsky are the only chess players to have defeated 9 undisputed world champions in classical games. 
* Keres defeated every world champion from Capablanca (3rd) to Fischer (11th): José Raúl Capablanca, Alexander Alekhine, Max Euwe, Mikhail Botvinnik, Vasily Smyslov, Mikhail Tal, Tigran Petrosian, Boris Spassky, Bobby Fischer.
* Korchnoi defeated every world champion from Botvinnik (6th) to Kasparov (13th), and also Carlsen (16th): Botvinnik, Smyslov, Tal, Petrosian, Spassky, Fischer, Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov, Magnus Carlsen. 
* Beliavsky has defeated every world champion from Smyslov (7th) to Carlsen (16th), except for Fischer: Smyslov, Tal, Petrosian, Spassky, Karpov, Kasparov, Vladimir Kramnik, Viswanathan Anand, Carlsen.
If disputed world champions are included, then Garry Kasparov, Korchnoi, and Beliavsky share the record at 11. Kasparov has defeated 7 undisputed world champions (Smyslov, Tal, Petrosian, Spassky, Karpov, Kramnik, Anand) as well as 4 FIDE world champions (Alexander Khalifman, Ruslan Ponomariov, Rustam Kasimdzhanov and Veselin Topalov). Korchnoi defeated the 9 mentioned above, plus FIDE champions Ponomariov and Topalov. Beliavsky defeated the 9 mentioned above, plus FIDE champions Khalifman and Topalov. 
If draws are included, Korchnoi beat or drew 11 undisputed world chess champions in a row in classical games (he had draws against Anand and Kramnik) and all 4 disputed world champions (draws against Khalifman and Kasimdzhanov) – that is, every one since Alekhine's death in 1946.
==Rating records==
FIDE (chess's international governing body) adopted Elo ratings in 1970. Players who peaked before this year therefore do not feature in rating records. 
===Highest rating===
The highest rating ever achieved is 2882, by Magnus Carlsen on the May 2014 list and once again on the August 2019 list.<ref name="August 2019 FIDE rating list"></ref>

===Longest duration as number one===
Garry Kasparov was the world's highest-rated player on FIDE's rating list for a record 255 months, a number that is well ahead of all other world number ones since the inception of the list.<ref name="KasparovProfile" /> Before the list, Emanuel Lasker was the world's highest-rated player for 292 months between June 1890 and December 1926 according to Chessmetrics.<ref></ref>
==Age-related records==
===Youngest grandmaster===
The youngest player to be awarded the grandmaster title by FIDE is Sergey Karjakin. In 2002 he qualified for the title at the age of 12 years, 7 months, and 0 days. See List of youngest grandmasters for the history of this record.
===Oldest grandmaster===
Several players have been awarded honorary or retrospective grandmaster titles based on their past achievements. The oldest of these was Enrico Paoli, who was awarded the title in 1996 at the age of 88.
Apart from retrospective awards, a number of players have achieved the title by winning the World Senior Championship. The oldest player to gain the title in this way was Yuri Shabanov, who won the 2003 event and was awarded the title at the age of 66.
===Oldest combined age of players in a match===
In 2014, GM Victor Korchnoi (b. 1931) played a two-game match against GM Wolfgang Uhlmann (b.1935). Korchnoi won both games. The combined age of the two players was 162 years, which is almost certainly a record for a standard time control match between Grandmasters. In rapid time control, GM Victor Korchnoi played a four-game rapid match against GM Mark Taimanov (b.1926) in November 2015. Korchnoi won the match 2–1 with one draw. The combined ages of the players was 174.

==Simultaneous and blindfold records==
===Best and worst results in simultaneous exhibitions===
In 1922, José Raúl Capablanca, the recently crowned World Champion, played 103 opponents simultaneously in Cleveland. He completed the exhibition in seven hours, scoring 102 wins and one draw (99.5%), the best result ever in a simultaneous exhibition on over 75 boards.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
The best result in a simultaneous exhibition solely against grandmasters is former World Champion Garry Kasparov's performance against an Israeli team consisting of Boris Alterman, Alexander Huzman, Ilya Smirin, and Emil Sutovsky at Tel Aviv in 1998.<ref>Chessgames.com, urltoken Kasparov's super simuls </ref> Adding to the difficulty Kasparov played Black in half the games; usually in exhibitions the exhibitor plays White on all boards. A second round was played 2 days later with colors reversed. Kasparov scored 7–1 against an all 2600+ rated team and considers it one of the peak performances of his career.
Paul Morphy also gave an impressive exhibition. On April 26, 1859, at London's St. James Chess Club, Morphy played "five games simultaneously against a group of masters who could be described as among the top ten players of the day", scoring 3–2. He defeated Jules Arnous de Rivière and Henry Bird, drew Samuel Boden and Johann Löwenthal, and lost only to Thomas Wilson Barnes.<ref></ref>
The worst result in a simultaneous exhibition given by a master occurred in 1951, when International Master Robert Wade gave a simultaneous exhibition against 30 Russian schoolboys, aged 14 and under. After 7 hours of play, Wade had lost 20 games and drawn the remaining 10 (16.7%).<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref>GM Alexander Kotov wrote that former World Champion Max Euwe warned new arrivals in Moscow, "Just don't give exhibitions against Pioneers" (i.e. students at the Pioneers Palace) .</ref>
