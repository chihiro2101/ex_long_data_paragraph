==Biography==
Kerr was born in Cape Town, South Africa, on 10 June 1922<ref name="Telegraph"> urltoken Obituary: Bill Kerr, Daily Telegraph, 29 August 2014</ref> to an Australian performing arts family, growing up in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia.<ref name="Dixon">Stephen Dixon urltoken "Bill Kerr obituary", The Guardian, 31 August 2014</ref> His career in show business began when he was very young. Wilton, his son, recalled: "His mum used him instead of using a prop, a baby prop, she actually used her son, her newborn son, so he was literally kind of born to do it."<ref> urltoken "Actor Bill Kerr dies at home in Perth, aged 92", ABC (Australia), 29 August 2014</ref>

Kerr's first dramatic role on screen was a high-profile one in the Cinesound film The Silence of Dean Maitland (1934), where he displays striking presence as a blind child.<ref name="Naglazas"></ref> Kerr is one of the most important child performers in early Australian film. He saw service in the Australian army during the Second World War, and performed in theatrical shows at home and abroad and toured with his friend, the actor Peter Finch.<ref name="Sallur"/>
==Career in Britain==
After the war, Kerr moved to Britain in 1947.<ref name="BBC290814"> urltoken "Bill Kerr, Australian actor and radio star, dies aged 92", BBC News, 29 August 2014</ref> During the next few years he was regularly featured in the BBC radio series Variety Bandbox, part of the BBC Light Programme. Retaining his accent, an unusual choice for performers moving to Britain at this time, he was billed as "the boy from Wagga Wagga." A spokesman for the Australian town's museum said that this "struck an instant chord with the post-war British audience, who thought of 'Wagga Wagga' as a comically surreal, end of the earth, magical place somewhere left of Narnia."<ref>Natasha Culzac
 urltoken "Bill Kerr dead at 92: Australian actor that became the 'Boy from Wagga Wagga' dies", The Independent, 29 August 2014</ref> Harry Secombe described Kerr as having a "very laconic act" on the show, beginning his spots with the catchphrase "I'm only here for four minutes."<ref>Harry Secombe urltoken Arias and Raspberries: An Autobiography, London: Pan Books, 1997 1989, p.144</ref>
From 1954 to 1959, he had a regular role as an Australian lodger in the BBC radio comedy series Hancock's Half Hour.<ref name="Spike&Co"> (b)p.158</ref> The series, with comedian Tony Hancock as the eponymous lead and also featuring Sid James, ran for six series.<ref name="Telegraph"/> Initially sharper than Hancock's characterisation, Kerr's portrayal eventually developed into a more dim-witted character who became the butt of Hancock's jokes.<ref name="Dixon"/> Unlike James, Kerr did not feature in the television version of the Hancock series. Kerr also starred in the highly entertaining radio drama series "The Flying Doctor" (1958–63)<ref></ref> regularly flying in and out of the fictitious Wollumboola base as he and his "doctor" colleague brought reprobates to justice in the outback. Later, after Sid James had ended his professional partnership with Hancock, Kerr briefly resumed working with him in the first series of the television comedy Citizen James (1960).<ref> urltoken Citizen James, BBC Comedy</ref> Kerr's other television appearances in Britain include a Doctor Who serial called The Enemy of the World (1968), with Patrick Troughton, and a long-running part in the early 1960s BBC-TV soap, Compact.

This was a sitcom written by Spike Milligan and Neil Shand, which was cancelled by the BBC after just one episode had been broadcast.<ref></ref> He also appeared in several British films, such as The Dam Busters (1955) and The Wrong Arm of the Law (1963).<ref>Nicky Harley urltoken "Actor Bill Kerr dies age 92", Daily Telegraph, 29 August 2014</ref>
