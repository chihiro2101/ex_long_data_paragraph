Technion – Israel Institute of Technology

==History==
The Technikum was conceived in the early 1900s by the German-Jewish fund Ezrah as a school of engineering and sciences. It was to be the only institution of higher learning in the then Ottoman Palestine, other than the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem (founded in 1907). In October 1913, the board of trustees selected German as the language of instruction, provoking a major controversy known as the War of the Languages. After opposition from American and Russian Jews to the use of German, the board of trustees reversed itself in February 1914 and selected Hebrew as the language of instruction. The German name Technikum was also replaced by the Hebrew name Technion.<ref name="technikum"/><ref name="cie"></ref>
Technion's cornerstone was laid in 1912, and studies began 12 years later in 1924.<ref name="cie"/> In 1923 Albert Einstein visited and planted the now-famous first Arecaceae, as an initiative of Nobel tradition. The first palm tree still stands today in front of the old Technion building, which is now the MadaTech museum, in the Hadar neighborhood. Einstein founded the first Technion Society, and served as its president upon his return to Germany.
In 1924, Arthur Blok became the Technion's first president.<ref> urltoken
