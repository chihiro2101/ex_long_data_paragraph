Grand Prairie, Texas

==Education==
===Primary and secondary schools===
====Public schools====
Most of Grand Prairie's K-12 student population attends schools in the Grand Prairie Independent School District, which serves areas of Grand Prairie in Dallas County. The Mansfield Independent School District serves areas of Grand Prairie in Tarrant County and operates six elementary schools within the Grand Prairie city limits. Other portions of Grand Prairie reside within the Arlington, Cedar Hill, Irving, Mansfield, and Midlothian school districts.<ref>" urltoken Greetings from Grand Prairie ." City of Grand Prairie.

In Texas, school district boundaries do not follow city and county boundaries because all aspects of the school district government apparatus, including school district boundaries, are separated from the city and county government entirely, with the exception of the Stafford Municipal School District in the Houston area.
=====Grand Prairie Independent School District=====
The high schools in the district are South Grand Prairie High School, Grand Prairie High School, Crosswinds High School and Dubiski Career High School. Middle schools include YMLA at Kennedy, Jackson, Reagan, Truman, Fannin, and Adams. Elementary schools include Austin, Bonham, Bowie, Bush, Crockett, Daniels, Dickinson, Eisenhower, Florence Hill, Garcia, Garner, Johnson, Lee, Marshall, Milam, Monroe, Moseley, Powell, Rayburn, Seguin, Travis, Whitt, Williams, and Zavala. However, Grand Prairie Collegiate Institute and YWLA at Bill Arnold offers both high school and middle school education.
=====Arlington Independent School District=====
The Arlington ISD has the second highest portion of Grand Prairie's K-12 student population. Six Arlington ISD elementary schools are within the city limits of Grand Prairie. Grand Prairie residents in the Arlington ISD are located generally west of the Dallas-Tarrant County boundary and north of the intersection of Camp Wisdom and Lake Ridge in southwest Grand Prairie. One of the Arlington high schools, James Bowie High, has more Grand Prairie residents than Arlington residents that are students at the school.
Grand Prairie student/residents in the Arlington ISD attend Bowie, Sam Houston, or Lamar High School in the Arlington ISD and their feeder elementary schools and junior high schools.
=====Mansfield Independent School District=====
The Mansfield ISD contains the third highest portion of the Grand Prairie's K-12 student population. Grand Prairie residents in the Mansfield ISD are located generally south of the intersection of Camp Wisdom and Lake Ridge, and west of Joe Pool Lake to the Tarrant and Ellis County line in southwest Grand Prairie. Three Mansfield ISD schools, Anna May Daulton Elementary; Louise Cabaniss Elementary; and Cora Spencer Elementary, are currently open within the city limits of Grand Prairie. The Mansfield ISD is the fastest growing ISD in Tarrant County, and the population growth in far southwest Grand Prairie is a major factor in the Mansfield ISD's subsequent growth.
Grand Prairie students/residents in the Mansfield ISD attend Mansfield Timberview High School, Lake Ridge High School or Mansfield High School in the Mansfield ISD or their feeder elemetaries and middle schools. Timberview High School is located on State Highway 360 less than from the Grand Prairie city line.
==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Interstate highways 20 and 30 run east–west through the northern and southern parts of the city. Texas State Highways Spur 303 (named Pioneer Parkway) and 180 (Main Street) also run east–west in the northern and central portions of the city.
SH 360 runs for almost three miles in the northwestern portion of city; most of the highway runs just west of the city limits in Arlington.
SH 161, named the President George Bush Turnpike, runs north–south through western Grand Prairie. The main lanes were opened in late 2012 with frontage roads open since 2010. Portions of the highway located north of SH 180 are depressed while the portion south of SH 180 runs at-grade then becomes elevated. Frontage roads remain at-grade throughout. The frontage road intersection at Main Street will open sometime in 2013.<ref></ref>
Belt Line Road is a major north–south thoroughfare in the city. The section of the road south of Main Street is dual-labelled as FM 1382, which travels south, past I-20 and continues south to Cedar Hill. The section of the road north of Main Street keeps its name, continuing north into Irving.
There is presently no public transportation in Grand Prairie, as the city is not a member of DART. The city declined membership in 1984.
In the era of private operation of passenger trains prior to the onset of the Amtrak era in 1971, Texas and Pacific Railway trains such as the Texas Eagle and the Louisiana Eagle made stops in Grand Prairie, on trips between Fort Worth and Dallas.<ref> urltoken 1967 schedule of the Texas Eagle Streamliner Schedules, from the Official Guide of the Railways</ref><ref> urltoken 1952 schedule of the Louisiana Eagle, Streamliner Schedules, from the Official Guide of the Railways</ref><ref></ref> Amtrak's Texas Eagle (Chicago-San Antonio) makes stops at Dallas Union Station 12 miles to the east.
