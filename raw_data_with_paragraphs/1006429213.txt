Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)

=== Dedication ===
Beethoven originally dedicated the third symphony to Napoleon Bonaparte, who he believed embodied the democratic and anti-monarchical ideals of the French Revolution. In the autumn of 1804, Beethoven withdrew his dedication of the third symphony to Napoleon, lest it cost him the composer's fee paid him by a noble patron; so, Beethoven re-dedicated his third symphony to Prince Joseph Franz Maximilian Lobkowitz – nonetheless, despite such a bread-and-butter consideration, the politically idealistic Beethoven titled the work "Bonaparte".<ref></ref> Later, about the composer's response to Napoleon having proclaimed himself Emperor of the French (14 May 1804), Beethoven's secretary, Ferdinand Ries said that:
<blockquote>In writing this symphony, Beethoven had been thinking of Bonaparte, but Bonaparte while he was First Consul. At that time Beethoven had the highest esteem for him, and compared him to the greatest consuls of Ancient Rome. Not only I, but many of Beethoven's closer friends, saw this symphony on his table, beautifully copied in manuscript, with the word "Bonaparte" inscribed at the very top of the title-page and "Ludwig van Beethoven" at the very bottom .
I was the first to tell him the news that Bonaparte had declared himself Emperor, whereupon he broke into a rage and exclaimed, "So he is no more than a common mortal! Now, too, he will tread under foot all the rights of Man, indulge only his ambition; now he will think himself superior to all men, become a tyrant!" Beethoven went to the table, seized the top of the title-page, tore it in half and threw it on the floor. The page had to be recopied, and it was only now that the symphony received the title Sinfonia eroica.<ref> urltoken Eroica, Napoleon Series.</ref></blockquote>
An extant copy of the score bears two scratched-out, hand-written subtitles; initially, the Italian phrase Intitolata Bonaparte ("Titled Bonaparte"), secondly, the German phrase Geschriben auf Bonaparte ("Written for Bonaparte"), four lines below the Italian subtitle. Three months after retracting his initial Napoleonic dedication of the symphony, Beethoven informed his music publisher that "The title of the symphony is really Bonaparte". In 1806, the score was published under the Italian title Sinfonia Eroica . composta per festeggiare il sovvenire di un grande Uomo ("Heroic Symphony, Composed to celebrate the memory of a great man").<ref>Dahlhaus, Carl.

=== Early performances and reviews ===
Composed from the autumn of 1803 until the spring of 1804, the earliest rehearsals and performances of the third symphony were private, and took place in the Vienna palace of Beethoven's noble patron, Prince Lobkowitz. An account record dated 9 June 1804, submitted by the prince's Kapellmeister Anton Wranitzky, shows that the prince hired twenty-two extra musicians (including the third horn required for the Eroica) for two rehearsals of the work.<ref>Account record currently on display in the exhibition at the Lobkowicz Palace, Prague.</ref> The fee paid to Beethoven by Prince Lobkowitz would also have secured further private performances of the symphony that summer on his Bohemian estates, Eisenberg (Jezeří) and Raudnitz (Roudnice). The first public performance was on 7 April 1805, at the Theater an der Wien, Vienna; for which concert the announced (theoretical) key for the symphony was Dis (D major, 9 sharps).<ref name=grove>Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed., 1954, Eric Blom, ed.</ref>
Reviews of the work's public premiere (on 7 April 1805) were decidedly mixed. The concert also included the premiere of a Symphony in E flat major by Anton Eberl (1765–1807) that received better reviews than Beethoven's symphony.<ref name=grove /><ref></ref> One correspondent describes the first reactions to the Eroica:
<blockquote>
Musical connoisseurs and amateurs were divided into several parties. One group, Beethoven's very special friends, maintains that precisely this symphony is a masterpiece. The other group utterly denies this work any artistic value . through strange modulations and violent transitions . with abundant scratchings in the bass, with three horns and so forth, a true if not desirable originality can indeed be gained without much effort. .The third, very small group stands in the middle; they admit that the symphony contains many beautiful qualities, but admit that the context often seems completely disjointed, and that the endless duration . exhausts even connoisseurs, becoming unbearable to the mere amateur. To the public the symphony was too difficult, too long . Beethoven, on the other hand, did not find the applause to be sufficiently outstanding.<ref>Der Freymüthige vol. 3, Vienna, 17 April 1805 (17 April 1805): 332.

One reviewer at the premiere wrote that "this new work of B. has great and daring ideas, and . great power in the way it is worked out; but the symphony would improve immeasurably if B. could bring himself to shorten it, and to bring more light, clarity, and unity to the whole."<ref>Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, vol. 7, "Vienna, 9 April" (1 May 1805): 501–02, reprinted in translation in Senner et al. vol. 2, p. 17</ref> Another said that the symphony was "for the most part so shrill and complicated that only those who worship the failings and merits of this composer with equal fire, which at times borders on the ridiculous, could find pleasure in it".<ref>Berlinische musikalische Zeitung, vol. 1, "Miscellaneous News, Vienna, 2 May 1805" (1805): 174, reprinted in translation in Senner et al. vol. 2, p. 18</ref> But a reviewer just two years later described the Eroica simply as "the greatest, most original, most artistic and, at the same time, most interesting of all symphonies".<ref>Journal des Lulus und der Modern, vol. 23, "On Permanent Concerts in Leipzig during the Previous Semiannual Winter Season" (1807), reprinted in translation in Senner et al. vol. 2, pp. 35–36.</ref>
The finale in particular came in for criticism that it did not live up to the promise of the earlier movements. An early reviewer found that "the finale has much value, which I am far from denying it; however, it cannot very well escape from the charge of great bizarrerie."<ref>Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, vol. 9, "News, Mannheim" (28 January 1807): 285–86, reprinted in translation in Senner et al. vol. 2, p. 19.</ref> Another agreed that "the finale pleased less, and that "the artist often wanted only to play games with the audience without taking its enjoyment into account simply in order to unloose a strange mood and, at the same time, to let his originality sparkle thereby".<ref>Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, vol. 9, "News, Prague" (17 June 1807): 610, reprinted in translation in Senner et al. vol. 2, p. 34.</ref> An exhaustive review of the work in a leading music journal made an observation that may still be familiar to first-time listeners: "this finale is long, very long; contrived, very contrived; indeed, several of its merits lie somewhat hidden. They presuppose a great deal if they are to be discovered and enjoyed, as they must be, in the very moment of their appearance, and not for the first time on paper afterwards."<ref>Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, vol. 9, "Review" (18 February 1807): 321–33, reprinted in translation in Senner et al. Vol. 2, p. 30.</ref> A review of an 1827 performance in London wrote that this particular performance "most properly ended with the funeral march, omitting the other parts, which are entirely inconsistent with the avowed design of the composition".<ref>The Harmonicon, vol. 5, pt. 1, p. 123, "Review of Royal Academic Concert on 30 April 1827" (1827), available on urltoken Google Books (visited 21 May 2017).</ref>
The symphony premiered in London on 26 March 1807 at the Covent Garden Theatre and in Boston on 17 April 1810 by the newly founded Boston Philharmonic Society both performances receiving fairly mixed reviews.
=== Manuscripts and editions ===
The original autograph manuscript does not survive. A copy of the score with Beethoven's handwritten notes and remarks, including the famous scratch-out of the dedication to Napoleon on the cover page, is housed in the library of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna. A first published edition (1806) of Beethoven's Eroica is on display at the Lobkowicz Palace in Prague.<ref>This 1st ed. comprises 18 parts, and contains corrections made by Beethoven. Wien Kunst-u.

Several modern scholarly editions have appeared in recent decades, including those edited by Jonathan Del Mar (published by Bärenreiter), Peter Hauschild (Breitkopf & Härtel), and Bathia Churgin (Henle).
== Assessment ==
=== Significance ===
The work is a milestone work in classical music; it is twice as long as the symphonies of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart – the first movement is almost as long as a Classical symphony (with repetition of the exposition). Thematically, it covers more emotional ground than Beethoven's earlier symphonies, and thus marks a key milestone in the transition between Classicism and Romanticism that would define Western art music in the early decades of the nineteenth century.
The second movement especially displays a great emotional range, from the misery of the funeral march theme, to the relative solace of happier, major-key episodes. The finale displays a similar emotional range, and is given a thematic importance then unheard of. In earlier symphonies, the finale was a quick and breezy conclusion; here, the finale is a lengthy set of variations and a fugue.<ref name="bernstein-inf-variety">Leonard Bernstein, The Infinite Variety of Music, Hal Leonard Corporation, </ref>
=== Critical opinions and phrases ===
* In the Treatise on Instrumentation (1844, 1855), Hector Berlioz discussed Beethoven's orchestral use and applications of the horn and of the oboe in this symphony.<ref> urltoken Eroica Symphony , Wiſdom Portal.</ref>
* The critic J. W. N. Sullivan said that the first movement expresses Beethoven's courage in confronting deafness; the second movement, slow and dirge-like, communicates his despair; the third movement, the scherzo, is an "indomitable uprising of creative energy"; and the fourth movement is an exuberant outpouring of energy.<ref></ref>
* In Metamorphosen (1945), Richard Strauss presents themes similar to the funeral march of the Sinfonia Eroica; near the conclusion of the Metamorphoses, the bass quotes the funeral march proper from the Sinfonia Eroica. Academics speculate that Strauss's sub-title "In Memoriam" refers to Ludwig van Beethoven.<ref></ref>
* In the recording Eroica (1953) and in the book The Infinite Variety of Music (1966), the conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein said that the first and second movements are "perhaps the greatest two movements in all symphonic music".<ref name=bernstein1957 /><ref></ref>
* In the article Beethoven's Cry of Freedom (2003), the Marxist critic Gareth Jenkins said that in the Sinfonia Eroica "Beethoven was doing for music what Napoleon was doing for society – turning tradition upside down", and so embodied the "sense of human potential and freedom" that first appeared during the French Revolution.<ref>Jenkins, Gareth. urltoken "Beethoven's Cry of Freedom", Socialist Worker (UK) 4 October 2003.</ref>

== Cinema ==
In 2003, a Simon Cellan Jones-directed BBC/Opus Arte made-for-television film, Eroica, was released, with Ian Hart as Beethoven. The Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique, conducted by Sir John Eliot Gardiner, performed the Eroica symphony in its entirety. The subject of the film is the private 1804 premiere of the work at the palace of Prince Lobkowitz (Jack Davenport). The film is based in part on Ferdinand Ries' recollections of the event.<ref></ref> In the film Beethoven does not learn that Napoleon has crowned himself Emperor of France until after the performance of the symphony is over – while having dinner with Ferdinand Ries. Rather than tearing up the title page of the symphony, he simply crumples it up.

While the movement plan gives no explicit indication regarding the finale, Lewis Lockwood argues that "there cannot be any doubt that Beethoven intended from the start" to use the same theme (and bass of the theme) that he had just fleshed out in the Opus 35 Variations. Thus, it is argued that Beethoven's initial conception for a complete symphony in E – including its first three movements – emerged directly from the Op. 35 Variations.<ref name=lockwood2015 />
The first movement's main theme (mm. 2–6) has thus been traced back to the bass line theme of the Opus 35 variations (E, B↓, B↑, E by way of intermediate versions found in one of Beethoven's sketchbooks.<ref name=fishman1962 /><ref name=lockwood2015 /> In the second movement, the combined tonality (melody and bass) of the Opus 35 theme's first four bars – E, B↓, B7(A↑, E – appears in slightly altered form as the funeral's march's second theme (E, B↓, A↑, E (mvt. II, mm. 17–20), followed by two sudden forte Bs that echo later elements of the theme. That same tonality then appears unaltered as the scherzo's main theme (mvt. III, mm. 93–100).
Thus, the first three movements can be viewed as symphonic-length "variations" on the Opus 35 theme, ultimately anticipating the theme's appearance in the fourth movement. Moreover, Beethoven's choice to begin the symphony with a theme adapted from the bass line is also paralleled in the fourth movement, in which the bass theme is heard as the first variation before the main theme ultimately appears. This again parallels the structure of the Opus 35 variations themselves. Finally, the loud E chord that begins the Opus 35 variations themselves is moved here to the beginning of the first movement, in the form of the two chords that introduce the first movement.
Alternatively, the first movement's resemblance to the overture to the comic opera Bastien und Bastienne (1768), composed by twelve-year-old W. A. Mozart, has been noted.<ref name=grove1896 /><ref></ref> It was unlikely that Beethoven knew of that unpublished composition. A possible explanation is that Mozart and Beethoven each coincidentally heard and learned the theme from elsewhere.<ref>Gutman, Robert W., Mozart: A Cultural Biography, 1999, p. 242</ref>
