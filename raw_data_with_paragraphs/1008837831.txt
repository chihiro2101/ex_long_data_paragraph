Cards on the Table

==Plot==
Meeting by chance at an art exhibition, the flamboyant collector Mr Shaitana tells Hercule Poirot of his personal crime-related collection, and invites him to a dinner party to see it. Scoffing at the idea of collecting mere artefacts, Shaitana explains that he collects only the best exhibits: criminals who have evaded justice.
Poirot's fellow guests include three other crime professionals: secret service man Colonel Race, mystery writer Mrs Ariadne Oliver, and Superintendent Battle of Scotland Yard; along with four people Shaitana believes to be murderers: Dr Roberts, Mrs Lorrimer, Anne Meredith, and Major Despard. Shaitana taunts his suspects with comments that each understands as applying only to them. 
The guests retire to play bridge, the crime professionals playing in one room while the others play in a second room where Shaitana relaxes by the fire. As the party breaks up, Shaitana is found to be dead – stabbed in the chest with a stiletto from his own collection. 
None of the suspects can be ruled out, as all had left their places at the table during the evening. Leading the police investigation, Superintendent Battle agrees to put his "cards on the table" and to allow the other professionals to make their own enquiries. Poirot concentrates on the psychology of the murderer.
The investigators look into the suspects' histories: the husband of one of Dr Roberts' patients died of anthrax shortly after accusing the doctor of improper conduct; and a botanist that Despard had been guiding through the Amazon was rumoured to have been shot. Anne's housemate Rhoda Dawes tells Mrs Oliver in confidence about an incident that Anne has been concealing, when an elderly woman for whom Anne was acting as companion died after mistaking poison for syrup of figs. Mrs Lorrimer's husband had died twenty years earlier, though little is known about that.
Mrs Lorrimer asks Poirot to visit her, tells him that she has just been diagnosed with a terminal illness, and that she wishes to confess to the killing both of her husband and of Shaitana. Poirot refuses to believe her psychologically capable of spontaneous murder, and thinks that she is protecting Anne. Mrs Lorrimer reluctantly discloses that she had actually seen Anne commit the crime, but feels sympathy for a young girl who is just starting out in life. The next day, each of the other suspects receives in the morning's post a confession and suicide note. Battle informs Poirot by telephone that although several people had rushed to her house it was too late, and she had died of an overdose. Poirot is again suspicious, as he knows that Anne had visited the previous night. He discovers that Mrs Lorrimer could not have sent the letters.
Realising that Rhoda's life may be in danger (she being the only person who might give Anne away), Poirot, Battle and Despard race to Rhonda's cottage, arriving just as Anne – out on the river – attempts to drown her. In the event, Anne herself drowns while Rhonda is rescued by Despard.
Poirot explains his findings. Although Despard had indeed shot and killed the botanist, that had been not murder but an accident. Anne had poisoned her employer by switching two bottles to conceal her petty thieving. Although Mrs Lorrimer thought she had seen Anne kill Shaitana, Anne had in fact just leaned forward to touch him, realising he was already dead.
Poirot explains that only one person was pyschologically capable of carrying out a spur-of the-moment stabbing, namely Dr Roberts. Believing that Shaitana meant to reveal him as the anthrax killer, Roberts quickly took his chance. He covered his tracks by forging Mrs Lorrimer's letters and killing her with an injection when he was first to arrive at her house the next morning. Although Roberts initially protests, he is forced to confess when Poirot reveals a surprise eye-witness, a window-cleaner.
After Roberts is led away, Ronda notes what amazing luck it was that the window-cleaner had been there at the exact moment of the fatal injection. Poirot replies that that had not been luck at all, and introduces them to the actor whose presence had prompted Roberts' confession.
With the murder solved, Despard courts Rhoda.

==Foreword by the author==
The novel contains a foreword by the author in which she explains that the novel has only four suspects and that since any of them, given the right circumstances, might have committed the crime, the deduction must be "entirely psychological". She notes that the book is no less interesting for that since "when all is said and done it is the mind of the murderer that is of supreme interest".<ref></ref>
==Literary significance and reception==
The Times Literary Supplement (14 November 1936) stated favourably in its review by Caldwell Harpur that, "Poirot scores again, scores in two senses, for this appears to be the authoress's twentieth novel. One of the minor characters in it is an authoress of thirty-two detective novels; she describes in several amusing pages the difficulties of her craft. Certainly Mrs Christie ought to know them, but she continues to surmount them so well that another score of novels may be hoped for."<ref>The Times Literary Supplement, 14 November 1936 (p. 927)</ref>
In The New York Times Book Review (28 February 1937), Isaac Anderson concluded, "The story is ingenious, but there are one or two loose ends left dangling when his explanation is finished. Cards on the Table is not quite up to Agatha Christie's best work."<ref>The New York Times Book Review, 28 February 1937 (p. 23)</ref>
In The Observers issue of 15 November 1936, in a review section entitled Supreme de Poirot, "Torquemada" (Edward Powys Mathers) wrote, "I was not the only one who thought that Poirot or his creator had gone a little off the rails in Murder in Mesopotamia, which means that others beside myself will rejoice at Mrs Christie's brilliant come-back in Cards on the Table. This author, unlike many who have achieved fame and success for qualities quite other than literary ones, has studied to improve in every branch of writing in each of her detective stories. The result is that, in her latest book, we note qualities of humour, composition and subtlety which we would have thought beyond the reach of the writer of The Mysterious Affair at Styles. Of course, the gift of bamboozlement, with which Agatha Christie was born, remains, and has never been seen to better advantage than in this close, diverting and largely analytical problem. Cards on the Table is perhaps the most perfect of the little grey cells."<ref>The Observer, 15 November 1936 (p. 8)</ref>
The Scotsman (19 November 1936) wrote: "There was a time when M. Hercule Poirot thought of going into retirement in order to devote himself to the cultivation of marrows. Fortunately, the threat was never carried out; and in Mrs Christie's latest novel the little Belgian detective is in very good form indeed. The plot is simple but brilliant." The review concluded by saying, "Mrs Oliver, the novelist, is one of Mrs Christie's most amusing creations."<ref>The Scotsman, 19 November 1936 (p. 15)</ref>
E.R. Punshon of The Guardian reviewed the novel in the 20 November 1936 issue when he began, "Even in a tale of crime and mystery humour is often of high value." He went on to say that, "In this respect. Agatha Christie shows herself once again. a model of detective tales. There are delightful passages when Poirot anxiously compares other moustaches with his own and awards his own the palm, when his lips are forced to utter the unaccustomed words 'I was in error', when Mrs Oliver, famous authoress, discourses upon art and craft of fiction. But all that never obscures the main theme as Poirot gradually unravels the puzzle of which four bridge-players had murdered their host." He concluded, "Largely by a careful study of the score, Poirot is able to reach the truth, and Mrs Christie sees to it that he does so by way of springing upon the reader one shattering surprise after another."<ref>The Guardian, 20 November 1936 (p. 7)</ref>
Robert Barnard: "On the very top rung. Special opportunities for bridge enthusiasts, but others can play. Superb tight construction and excellent clueing. Will be read as long as hard-faced ladies gather for cards."<ref></ref>
Charles Osborne: "Cards on the Table is one of Agatha Christie's finest and most original pieces of crime fiction: even though the murderer is, as the author has promised, one of the four bridge players, the ending is positively brilliant and a complete surprise."<ref>Osborne, Charles (1982) The Life and Crimes of Agatha Christie, Collins (London)</ref>

==Adaptations==
===Stage adaptation===
The book was adapted as a stage play in 1981, although without Poirot. It opened at London's Vaudeville Theatre on 9 December 1981 with Gordon Jackson as Superintendent Battle and a cast that included Derek Waring, Belinda Carroll, Mary Tamm and Patricia Driscoll.<ref>Programme for Cards on the Table: Theatreprint, No. 80, May 1982</ref> This followed Christie's trend of adapting Poirot novels as plays, but without Poirot as a detective, as she did not feel that any actor could portray him successfully.
===Television===
;British 
ITV adapted the story into a television programme in the series Agatha Christie's Poirot starring David Suchet as Hercule Poirot and Zoë Wanamaker as Ariadne Oliver, which aired in the US on A&E Network in December 2005 and, in the UK, on ITV1 in March 2006. While the adaptation, written by Nick Dear, retains some elements of the plot, including the method of the murder and who committed it, the episode was only loosely based on the novel. The changes that were made included:
* Both Colonel Race and Superintendent Battle are replaced by new characters&nbsp;– Colonel Hughes and Superintendent Wheeler. The latter is made an additional suspect in the murder, in that Poirot learns that he had a shady involvement with Shaitana: he had been in a homosexual relationship with him and allowed himself to be photographed in compromising positions. Wheeler breaks into Shaitana's house, a few days later, to recover the photographs, but fails to find them; his knowledge of Shaitana's nationality gives away his connection to the victim, and he later has the photographs returned to him by Poirot, who retrieved them from a photography studio.
* Shaitana is found to have been drugged with sleeping pills, before being murdered, leading to a belief the murder was planned and not on impulse. Poirot later proves this to be incorrect, revealing that Shaitana had told him in a cryptic manner that he was a drug-user and was tired of life. The glass he was holding that contained traces of the drug, had only his fingerprints (apart from Wheeler's), thus Poirot points out that he had drugged himself, knowing he would be murdered, in order to fall asleep and thus feel nothing when he was killed.
* Dr Roberts' motive for the murder is changed. In the adaptation, he is involved in a homosexual affair with Mr Craddock, his usual bridge partner. Mrs Craddock found out what he had done and was overheard arguing about it and threatening to have Roberts blackballed. He thus murdered her by contaminating the needle he was using to inoculate her for her trip to Egypt, in order to continue his affair. Poirot exposes him with a bluff that Wheeler's photographs are evidence of his murder of Mrs Craddock. In addition, Roberts commits only two murders rather than four; he does not murder Mr Craddock or Mrs Lorrimer in the adaptation.
* Mrs Lorrimer has no fatal heart condition when she confesses to Poirot her crime of murdering her husband; her second husband, whom she desired to be with and thus was the motive for her murder, died a year after her crime from a heart attack. Furthermore, her motivation for protecting Anne Meredith is strengthened in the adaptation, in that she is her daughter, who ran away after witnessing her murdering her first husband and Meredith's father. 
* Rhoda Dawes is a close school friend of Anne Meredith, and the two women live together in a cottage. Anne's employer was Rhoda's aunt, whom Rhoda murdered after she discovered that her friend had been caught in the act of stealing from her aunt; Rhoda constantly reminded Anne of this death while she lived with her, and tries to dissuade her from taking the affections of Major Despard. In this adaptation, Rhoda is a lesbian that loved Anne. She eventually attempts to murder her friend when they take a punt; while Despard arrives in time to save Anne, Rhoda drowns after she is pulled into the water, before he can save her – much the opposite of what happens in the novel.
;French 
The novel was adapted as a 2014 episode of the French television series Les Petits Meurtres d'Agatha Christie.
===Radio===
Cards on the Table was adapted for radio by Michael Bakewell for BBC Radio 4, featuring John Moffatt as Hercule Poirot, Donald Sinden as Colonel Johnny Race, and Stephanie Cole as Ariadne Oliver. This adaptation was generally faithful to the plot of the novel.

Cards on the Table is a work of detective fiction by the English author Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 2 November 1936<ref>The Observer, 1 November 1936 (p. 6)</ref> and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year.<ref></ref><ref name="US"></ref> The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6)<ref name="CC"></ref> and the US edition at $2.00.<ref name="US"/>
The book features the recurring characters of Hercule Poirot, Colonel Race, Superintendent Battle and the crime writer Ariadne Oliver making her first appearance in a Poirot novel. The four detectives and four possible suspects play bridge after dinner with Mr Shaitana. At the end of the evening, Mr Shaitana is discovered murdered. Identifying the murderer, according to the author, depends wholly on discerning the psychology of the suspects.
This novel was well received at first printing and in later reviews. It was noted for its humour, for the subtlety of the writing, good clueing and tight writing, showing continuing improvement in the author's writing style in this, her twentieth novel. One later reviewer considered this in the top rung of her novels, and another found it to be most original, with a brilliant surprise ending.
