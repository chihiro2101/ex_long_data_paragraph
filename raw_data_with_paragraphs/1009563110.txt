Lynne Thigpen

==Death==
Thigpen died, at age 54, of a cerebral hemorrhage on March 12, 2003,<ref></ref> in her Marina del Rey, California, home after complaining of headaches for several days. Drugs and foul play were ruled out by the coroner's autopsy, which found "acute cardiac dysfunction, non-traumatic systemic and spontaneous intraventricular hemorrhage, and hemorrhage in the brain." She was entombed next to her parents at Elmhurst Cemetery in her hometown of Joliet, Illinois.
===Response and legacy===
After Thigpen died, the final three episodes of the third season of The District had a tribute to her character Ella Mae Farmer, with episode 66 (S3:E21) being entitled "Ella Mae."
Thigpen's death also led to a three-year hiatus of Bear in the Big Blue House, and a planned film version of Bear was put on hold. Two years after her death, Bear star Tara Mooney, who played the character Shadow, said in an interview with Ray D'Arcy on Today FM, "The crew's hearts just weren't in it anymore".
Thigpen was posthumously nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for voicing Luna the moon in Bear in the Big Blue House, but lost to Jeff Corwin for his wildlife reality series The Jeff Corwin Experience.
Thigpen's friends and family established a nonprofit foundation, The Lynne Thigpen–Bobo Lewis Foundation, to help young actors and actresses learn to survive and succeed in New York theater and to mentor the next generation of Broadway stars.<ref></ref>
Her final film, Anger Management (2003), was dedicated to her memory. Lynne Thigpen Elementary School in her hometown of Joliet, Illinois, was named for her.<ref name=joliet86></ref>
