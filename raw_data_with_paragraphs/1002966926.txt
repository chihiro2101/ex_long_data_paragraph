Bollington

==History==
From the late 18th through to the mid-20th century, Bollington was a major centre for cotton-spinning. urltoken Waterhouse mill, now demolished, off Wellington Road, once spun the finest cotton in the world, and was sought after by lace makers in Nottingham and in Brussels, Belgium.
Clarence Mill still stands. The lower floors remain commercial but the upper floors have been converted into apartments. One of the oldest surviving mills in Bollington is the very small urltoken Defiance Mill, built in urltoken Queen Street about 1800 and now restored for residential occupation.
There is a large coated paper mill on the site of urltoken Lower Mills. The original mill was built by urltoken George Antrobus in 1792 but very little of those buildings remain. A stone-built traditional mill still survives amongst the more recent brick developments. In the 1830s and 1840s this mill was rented to Thomas Oliver and urltoken Martin Swindells for the production of fine cotton thread for the lace-making industry. urltoken Lowerhouse mill (Antrobus, 1819, later occupied by Samuel Greg Jnr) also remains as an industrial mill, also producing coated papers.
The other remaining mill is urltoken Adelphi mill (Swindells, 1856), which is today entirely commercial.
In 1801, the population was 1,231. In 1851, the population was 4,655. In 1901, it had grown to 5,245. Population growth slowed during the mid-20th century such that by 1951 the population was 5,644. By 2001 the population had reached 7,095.<ref></ref>

==Media==
Bollington Live! is a publication produced three times a year by a team of volunteer writers, editor and distributors. It is funded by local businesses who sponsor and advertise. It covers a wide range of issues of local interest, from historical articles, to matters of current concern. The magazine is delivered free to every household and business in Bollington, plus others in Pott Shrigley and Whiteley Green by almost fifty volunteers. The magazine was started in 1994 by a group of residents who felt that whilst Bollington was served by the neighbouring Macclesfield newspapers, it was in need of a Bollington-centred publication. All copies are available online<ref name=bollingtonlive></ref> on the town's extensive Happy Valley web site.<ref name=happyvalleyhome></ref>
