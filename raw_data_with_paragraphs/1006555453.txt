Old Sarum

The present name seems to be a corruption of the medieval Latin and Norman forms of the name Salisbury, such as the Sarisburie that appeared in the Domesday Book.<ref name="Old Sarum 2003 p.24">English Heritage.

The longer name was first abbreviated as Sar̅, but, as such a mark was scribal abbreviations (common in placenames), the name was confused and became Sarum sometime around the 13th century. The earliest known use was on the seal of the hospital at Salisbury, which was in use in 1239. The 14th-century Robert Wyvil was the first to describe himself as episcopus Sarum.<ref>The Victoria History of the County of Wiltshire, , .</ref> The addition of 'old' to the name distinguished it from New Sarum, the formal name of the present-day city of Salisbury until 2009.
== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
The hilltop at Old Sarum shows evidence of Neolithic settlement<ref>English Heritage. Old Sarum, . (London), 2003.</ref> as early as 3000&nbsp;BC.<ref>English Heritage. Old Sarum, p.&nbsp;22. London, 2003.</ref> There is evidence that early hunters and, later, farming communities occupied the site. A protective hill fort was constructed by the local inhabitants around 400&nbsp;BC<ref name=beeb /> during the British Iron Age by creating enormous banks and ditches surrounding the hill. The hillfort is broadly oval shaped, measuring in length and in width. It consists of a double bank and intermediate ditch with an entrance on the eastern side. Numerous other hillforts of the same period can be found locally, including Figsbury Ring to the east and Vespasian's Camp to the north. The archaeologist Sir R.C. Hoare described it as "a city of high note in the remotest periods by the several tumulus near it, and its proximity to the two largest stone circles in England, namely, Stonehenge and Avebury."<ref name="hoare">"Ancient Wilts," — Sir R.C. Hoare, speaking of Stonehenge, expresses his opinion that "our earliest inhabitants were Celts, who naturally introduced with them their own buildings customs, rites, and religions ceremonies, and to them I attribute the erection of Stonehenge, and the greater part of the sepulchral memorials that still continue to render its environs so truly interesting to the antiquary and historian." Abury, or Avebury, is a village amidst the remains of an immense temple, which for magnificence and extent is supposed to have exceeded the more celebrated fabric of Stonehenge; some enthusiastic inquirers have however, carried their supposition beyond probability, and in their zeal have even supposed them to be antediluvian labours! Many of the barrows in the vicinity of Sarum have been opened, and in them several antiquarian relics have been discovered. In short, the whole county is one of high antiquarian interest, and its history has been illustrated with due fidelity and research. This has led more recent scholars to doubt the original inhabitants were actually Celts. It is now believed they may have been the much earlier "Beaker People", so named for the beaker-shaped pots they made.</ref>
=== Roman period ===
At the time of the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century, the area of Old Sarum seems to have formed part of the territory of the Atrebates,<ref name=sub> urltoken "Roman Sorbiodunum" at Stratford Sub Castle (Salisbury), 2014.

A motte-and-bailey castle was built by 1069, three years after the Norman Conquest.<ref name=wilt193 /> The castle was held directly by the Norman kings; its castellan was generally also the sheriff of Wiltshire.

An early 12th-century observer, William of Malmesbury, called Sarum a town "more like a castle than city, being environed with a high wall", and noted that "notwithstanding that it was very well accommodated with all other conveniences, yet such was the want for water that it sold at a great rate".<ref name=admirabile> urltoken A Description of that Admirable Structure, the Cathedral Church of Salisbury.

The issue was presented to kings Richard and John as the prime reason to relocate the cathedral<ref name=admirabile2 /> but seems to have only been part of the issue.
The late 12th-century canon Peter of Blois<ref name=pbj>Robinson, J. Armitage. :s:Somerset Historical Essays/Peter of Blois#128 Oxford University Press (London), 1921.</ref> described his prebendary as "barren, dry, and solitary, exposed to the rage of the wind" and the cathedral "as a captive on the hill where it was built, like the ark of God shut up in the profane house of Baal."<ref name="blesensis">Peter of Blois, Epistle No.&nbsp;105.</ref> Holinshed records that the clerics brawled openly with the garrison troops.<ref name=admirabile2 /> Herbert Poore received permission for the move from Richard I, who was agreeably disposed towards the diocese after discovering it held in coin in trust for his father, in addition to jewels, vestments, and plate,<ref name=admirabile3>A Description.

By papal order, Herbert's brother Richard Poore was translated from Chichester to succeed him in 1217; the next year, Sarum's dean and chapter presented arguments to Rome for the cathedral's relocation.<ref name=admirabile3 /> The investigation of these claims by the papal legate Cardinal Gualo verified the chapter's claims that the site's water was both expensive and sometimes restricted by the castellans; that housing within the walls was insufficient for the clerics, who were required to rent from the laity; that the wind was sometimes so strong that divine offices could not be heard and the roof was repeatedly damaged; and that the soldiers of the royal fortress restricted access to the cathedral precinct to the common folk during Ash Wednesday and on other occasions for providing the eucharist and the clerics felt imperiled by their circumstances.<ref name=admirabile4 /> thereupon issued an indulgence to relocate the cathedral on 29 March 1217 or 1218.<ref name=admirabile4>A Description.

The settlement that grew up around it was called New Salisbury, then (at least formally) New Sarum, then finally Salisbury. The former cathedral was formally dissolved in 1226.<ref name=sched /> The inhabitants of the new city gradually razed the old, constructing Salisbury Cathedral and other buildings from the materials at Old Sarum. Evidence of quarrying into the 14th century shows some continued habitation,<ref name=ush /> but the settlement was largely abandoned and ordered the castle's demolition in 1322.<ref name=sched />
=== Modern period ===
The castle grounds were sold by in 1514.<ref name=beeb /> From the reign of Edward II in the 14th century, the borough of Old Sarum elected two members to the House of Commons despite the fact that, from at least the 17th century, it had no resident voters at all. One of the members in the 18th century was William Pitt the Elder. In 1831, Old Sarum had eleven voters, all of whom were landowners who lived elsewhere. That made Old Sarum the most notorious of the rotten boroughs. The Reform Act 1832 subsumed the Old Sarum area into an enlarged borough of Wilton. Old Sarum was an extra-parochial area and became a civil parish in 1858, but the civil parish was abolished in 1894.<ref></ref>

In 1917, during World War I, a site just north-east of Old Sarum, along the Portway, was developed as the 'Ford Farm' aerodrome. That became Old Sarum Airfield, which remains in operation with a single grass runway.

Old Sarum is the site of the earliest settlement of Salisbury in England. Located on a hill about north of Salisbury near the A345 road, the settlement appears in some of the earliest records in the country. It is an English Heritage property and is open to the public.
The great monoliths of Stonehenge and Avebury were erected nearby and indications of #Prehistoric have been discovered from as early as 3000&nbsp;BC. An Iron Age hillfort was erected around 400&nbsp;BC, controlling the intersection of two native trade paths and the Hampshire Avon. The site continued to be occupied during the #Roman, when the paths became roads. The Saxons took the British fort in the 6th century and later used it as a stronghold against marauding Vikings. The #Norman constructed a motte and bailey castle, a stone curtain wall, and a great cathedral. A royal palace was built within Old Sarum Castle for and was subsequently used by Plantagenet monarchs. This heyday of the settlement lasted for around 300 years until disputes between the Sheriff of Wiltshire and the Bishop of Salisbury finally led to the removal of the church into the nearby plain. As Salisbury grew up around the construction site for the new cathedral in the early 13th century, the buildings of Old Sarum were dismantled for stone and the old town dwindled. Its long-neglected castle was abandoned by in 1322 and sold by in 1514.
Although the settlement was effectively uninhabited, its landowners continued to have parliamentary representation into the 19th century, making it one of the most notorious of the rotten boroughs that existed before the Reform Act 1832. Old Sarum served as a pocket borough of the Pitt family.
Edward Rutherfurd's 1987 novel Sarum traces the history of the town.
