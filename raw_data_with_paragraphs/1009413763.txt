Gohan

==Creation and design==
Gohan's name comes from the Japanese word , a continuation of the naming scheme of foods by Toriyama. Rice, being a grain, is not normally considered to be a vegetable, even though it is a common food. However, as the word "vegetable" is a culinary term, and not a botanical term, the name can also continue the naming scheme for Saiyan characters, which derives names from puns on vegetables.<ref> urltoken Online English to Japanese Dictionary </ref>
In conceptualizing for Gohan's character, Toriyama originally included glasses or a jacket to his apparel, and commonly, his hair is spiked up as seen in the final design.<ref name = f>Dragon Ball Daizenshū, book 4, Dragon Ball World Guide</ref> With the ending of the Cell arc, Gohan was meant to replace his father as the protagonist. However, Toriyama later decided against it, finding the character unsuited for the role in comparison to his father.<ref name="creation"></ref>
As opposed to full-blooded Saiyans, whose hair stays the same from birth,<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 16, chapter 181</ref> Gohan's is drawn at varying lengths, and changes markedly in style. Initially, Gohan is illustrated garbed in a surcoat with kanji 孫 (grandchild), fixed on the front and the four-star Dragon Ball fitted on top of his hat. Piccolo later supplies him with a keikogi fashioned after Goku's, but substitutes the symbol with his own demon character "".<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 2, chapter 13</ref> Normally thereafter, Gohan is drawn with a keikogi modeled after Piccolo's own. On Namek, Gohan is portrayed in battle armor worn by Frieza's henchmen, having been given it by Vegeta in preparation for their encounter with Frieza. Prior to his second fight with Majin Buu, Gohan asks Kibito for an outfit resembling his father's, and is then drawn in a keikogi identical to Goku's. Gohan, from the alternate future, is dressed in a keikogi similar to that of his father's with his kanji name 飯 (Gohan), and has a long scar across his left eye.
===Abilities===
Gohan possesses superhuman strength and durability,<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 23, chapter 277</ref> as well as superhuman speed and reflexes, as seen during his training with his younger brother Goten. As a child, Gohan is depicted with an immense amount of hidden potential, which at first only revealed itself when he experienced fierce rage or distress.<ref name="ReferenceA">Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 1, chapter 9</ref><ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 2, chapter 12</ref> The vastness of this potential is shown consistently throughout the series as he ages and learns to master his powers from constant training and battles, the earliest example was during his short fight with Raditz.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Gohan's potential was unlocked twice in the series: first by the Namekian Grand Elder,<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 7, chapter 77</ref> and then fully unlocked by Old Kaiō-shin,<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 25, chapter 294</ref> which sees his power level rise to new heights, capable of easily overwhelming the seemingly invincible Majin Buu.<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 25, chapter 303</ref>
As a Half-Saiyan, he has the ability to become an Oozaru, a gigantic ape-like creature, by absorbing waves from a full moon. He lost this ability after his tail was cut by Piccolo,<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 2, chapter 14</ref> and later Vegeta.<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 4, chapter 46</ref> He was the third youngest Saiyan to achieve the Super Saiyan transformation at the age of nine whilst training and surpassing his father Goku in the Room of Spirit and Time (hyperbolic time chamber)<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 16, chapter 188</ref> and as a display of his hidden potential which he unlocked during his training with his father, Gohan becomes the first Saiyan in the series to become a Super Saiyan 2 during his battle against Cell. Though Gohan had gotten much weaker due to not training after the Cell Games, he became stronger than he ever has after his potential was unlocked from Old Kaiō-shin. Gohan with this power up was even stronger than Super Saiyan 3 Goku and Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks since he was able to dominate Super Buu with ease without transforming.
Ever since this fight, Gohan has given up on fighting and has continually gotten weaker to the point that he can't use his Super Saiyan transformations without straining himself. Gohan can still hold his own against Frieza's soldiers, Shisami, and Tagoma in his base form and overpower them when he transforms into a Super Saiyan. After Frieza's attack on Earth, Gohan returned to training with Piccolo. During his training with Piccolo before the start of the Tournament of Power, Gohan is pushed beyond his limits and manages to unlock his hidden power once again, becoming stronger than ever before.
Gohan has the ability to freely manipulate a life-force energy known as ki to fly using ,.<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 6, chapters 61-62</ref> He can also concentrate his ki to fire blasts of energy, such as the or the .<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 20, chapter 233</ref> Gohan has displayed the use of his ki in a defensive manner, such as generating protective energy shields. Both as a child and an adult, Gohan is known to be a capable swordsman, as well as an adept teacher.
===Voice actors===
Gohan is voiced in the original Japanese anime and all other media by Masako Nozawa. Nozawa, who also voices Goku, revealed that she did not know she would be playing Gohan until receiving the script on the day of recording his debut episode. Despite having to voice Gohan, Goku, Goten and Bardock, Nozawa claims she is able to instantly get into the respective character simply upon seeing their image.
In Funimation and Saban Entertainment initial 1996 English dub of Dragon Ball Z, Gohan is voiced by Saffron Henderson. Henderson reprised her role in AB Group and Westwood Media's alternate dub for the UK and Canadian markets in 2000. Jillian Michaels replaced Henderson in the later part of the Cell arc, while his adult version is voiced by Brad Swaile. Henderson believed her experience playing Goku in Dragon Ball made it simple to develop Gohan's voice, though stressed performing as him was "tiring" due to the action of the series requiring louder volumes. She also remembered scheduling conflicts thanks to her wedding, setting the stage for the studio to audition other voice actors for the part of Gohan, and being disappointed at the role being recast.<ref></ref>
In Funimation's in-house dub, Gohan's child incarnation is voiced by Stephanie Nadolny for various media until 2010 and Colleen Clinkenbeard for Dragon Ball Kai and later media while his adult incarnation is voiced by Kyle Hebert for almost all various media and Dameon Clarke as "Future Gohan" for some episodes and the History of Trunks TV special. Nadolny was called in to audition in 1999, when the English dub of Dragon Ball Z was recast. She said her most challenging time voicing the character was during his fight against Cell where she had to make him sound as "deep, tough and as much like a man as possible." Nadolny's voice was strained during the recordings, causing her to sometimes leave the studio in pain.<ref></ref> Hebert said that his roles as Gohan and the narrator of Dragon Ball Z are close to him as they kickstarted his career.<ref></ref> He also found Battle of Gods to be "genuinely touching" outside of its fighting, citing Gohan finding out that he was going to be a father among the moments he found sentimental and was happy to return to the franchise when reprising his role in Resurrection 'F, also expressing interest in redoing his lines in Dragon Ball Kai as he had more experience.<ref></ref>
In the English dub of the video game Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout, Gohan is voiced by Lex Lang. In the English dub of Dragon Ball GT produced by Blue Water Studios distributed in Canada, he was voiced by Scott Roberts. In the English dub of movies distributed in Europe by AB Groupe, Gohan was voiced by Jodi Forrest, with David Gasman voicing Gohan as an adult in The History of Trunks. In the Toonami Asia dub produced by Bang Zoom! Entertainment of Dragon Ball Super, Gohan here is voiced by Chris Hackney.
In a rare English dub of the anime produced in the Philippines by Creative Products Corporation, Gohan was voiced by Ethel Lizano who also directed that dub. In the 1996 dub of the double feature combining Cooler's Revenge and The Return of Cooler also by Creative Products Corp.; young Gohan was voiced by E.J. Galang, who was 12 years old at the time he voiced Gohan. 
==Appearances==
===In Dragon Ball===
Gohan is introduced as the four-year-old son of the series protagonist Goku, named after his adoptive great-grandfather. Described as well-mannered and reserved,<ref name = b></ref><ref name = c>Dragon Ball Daizenshū, book 2, Story Guide</ref> Gohan's story begins following his abduction by the extraterrestrial Saiyan named Raditz, who is also his uncle. While Goku is pinned to the ground, Gohan's extreme distress explodes with the release of his dormant power, which allows him to injure Raditz. Piccolo then takes Gohan away following the fight and Goku's death, and trains him for the upcoming battle against the two other Saiyans, Vegeta and Nappa, though Piccolo is aware that training the son of his greatest enemy will be a risk.<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 2, chapter 11</ref> His tutelage under Piccolo forms a deep bond between the two characters, with Piccolo ultimately sacrificing himself to save Gohan during their fight with Nappa.<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 3, chapter 29</ref> After Vegeta's defeat, Gohan travels with Bulma and Krillin to planet Namek to use the Dragon Balls there to revive their fallen friends, as the Dragon Balls on Earth had turned to stone due to the Earth's protector Kami's death.<ref></ref> After succeeding in gathering the Dragon Balls, Gohan and the others wish Piccolo back to life, causing Kami and the Dragon Balls to be returned. Gohan, along with Krillin and Vegeta, are then forced into an encounter with Frieza, who seeks the Dragon Balls for immortality. Shortly after the fight with Freeza begins, Krillin is impaled by one of Freeza's horns. Freeza stops Gohan as he tries to save Krillin, who has now been thrown into the ocean below, and he mocks him, saying it is pointless to try to save his friend since he and Vegeta are both about to die. Gohan is extremely angered by being unable to save Krillin and attacks Freeza without hesitation. He manages to knock Freeza into a small island below, and then he blasts him with a series of energy blasts before ending the attack with a Masenko.<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 9, chapter 103</ref> Later on in the fight, as Piccolo was getting repeatedly blasted from Freeza, who is now in his third form, Gohan blasts Freeza with another Masenko, and once again pushes him back with it. Freeza is able to send it back at Gohan without taking any damage, but he is once again shocked that a child could produce such an attack. Shortly after this, Freeza transforms into his original and most powerful form. Once he does this he immediately kills Dende, a young Namekian who had been secretly healing Gohan, Krillin, Piccolo and Vegeta.<ref></ref> Gohan is outraged by this and unleashes all of his power against Freeza. However, he is unable to land even a single blow.<ref></ref> After Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan enraged by the death of Krillin and defeats Freeza, the planet Namek explodes and Goku escapes while Freeza is left with serious injuries, Freeza is found in space by his father (King Cold) and is turned into a cyborg. Gohan is shown to settle back into school life on Earth, waiting for Goku to return home from Namek.<ref></ref>
After Trunks kills Freeza and his father King Cold then tells Goku about the Androids,<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 12, chapter 138</ref> Gohan goes into the wilderness with Goku and Piccolo to train for the upcoming threat.<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 12, chapter 142</ref> After Vegeta kills Android #19,<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 13, chapter 150</ref> Dr. Gero (Android #20) activate Androids #17 and #18,<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 13, chapter 155</ref> and Cell is discovered,<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 14, chapter 167</ref> Gohan enters the Room of Spirit and Time with Goku where they train for 1 year (1 day on earth, however in their case according to Mr. Popo, Goku and Gohan still had 3 hours left in the room, but they came out having finished their training earlier than expected). Gohan makes the jump to Super Saiyan while he is in the chamber and after they emerge, both Goku and Gohan retain the physical characteristics of a Super Saiyan without any of the drawbacks of its form (increased aggression, energy loss, etc.). After Goku initially fights Cell but realizes later that he cannot defeat him, Gohan is called to fight to the surprise of everyone else and Cell. During the fight, Gohan asks Cell to stop the Cell Games tournament and then he tells him about his power. Cell, instead of heeding Gohan's warning, attacks him in an effort to force Gohan to show his true power. Gohan holds his own for a while until Cell becomes impatient and bored.<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 18, chapter 212</ref> He releases Cell Juniors on the other fighters to provoke Gohan from attacking. After Android 16 is murdered by Cell, Gohan unleashes his rage and transforms into a Super Saiyan 2.<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 18, chapter 213</ref> Gohan easily defeats the Cell Juniors and proceeds to toy with Cell, now that he has a much greater power level. This backfires, however; he waits too long to finish Cell, who decides to self-destruct when transformed back to his semi-perfect form, as a last-ditch effort to destroy Gohan and the Earth. Goku, in an act of self-sacrifice, uses teleportation to take Cell to Kaio-sama's planet. Thinking Cell dead, the fighters lower their guard only to be surprised by a blast that kills Trunks. Cell returns, having regenerated from a single Cell that survived the blast, and also adopted the instant transmission technique. Right before Cell is about to finish Vegeta, Gohan intercedes which costs him the use of his left arm.<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 18, chapter 220</ref> As Cell charges up one final Kamehameha wave to finish the Earth, Gohan hears the voice of his father who gives him the resolve he needs to defeat Cell. They both launch large Kamehameha waves at each other, which initiates a power struggle.<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 18, chapter 221</ref> Cell is about to overcome Gohan when Vegeta uses his remaining energy to blast Cell, which distracts him for a moment. Gohan uses this moment to unleash all his fury into his attack, which causes it to overpower Cell's. It hits Cell full-force which disintegrates all his cells, finally killing him.<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 18, chapter 222</ref>
The Gohan of the alternate timeline, referred to as "Future Gohan", to distinguish him from the character's present-timeline incarnation, is presented in the volume #33 sidestory of the original manga, Trunks the Story, in which he is shown to be the only surviving fighter; the others have all died at the hands of the androids (sans Goku due to having died from a heart virus prior to androids' arrival).<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 17, chapter 140</ref><ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 17, chapter 141</ref> Gohan is shown training Trunks to assist him in battling Androids #17 and #18.

When his peer, Videl figures out his identity as the Great Saiyaman, she blackmails him into attending the 25th Tenkaichi Budōkai and teaching her to fly.<ref>Dragon Ball manga, volume 36, chapter 425</ref> Over time, the two begin to bond together and eventually form a relationship. Gohan is depicted as having grown weaker, which the Daizenshū World Guide book explains as due to a lack of training and anger in transforming.<ref name = f/> Gohan, after having his Qi absorbed by Spopovich and Yamu, pursues the two and enters Bobbidi's spaceship with the Kaiō-shin, Goku and Vegeta, where Gohan later fights with Dabura.<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 22, chapter 257</ref> Following Majin Buu‘s release and Gohan's defeat at his hands, Gohan is taken to the home planet of the Kaiō-shin. After pulling out the Zeta Sword (Known in the English Funimation Dub as the Z Sword) and accidentally breaking it in a training session, Gohan unwittingly releases the Kaiō-shin, who then performs a prolonged ceremony to unlock Gohan's latent powers.<ref></ref> Gohan then returns to Earth and confronts Buu for a second time, and easily defeats him.<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 25, chapter 302</ref> However, his victory is temporary, as he is overpowered when Buu absorbs Gotenks and Piccolo. He is later absorbed by Buu.<ref>Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 25, chapter 307</ref> Though Goku and Vegeta manage to rescue him along with Goten, Trunks, and Piccolo, he is killed when Buu (now in his pure form) destroys the Earth.

==Reception==
In 1993, Gohan placed first in a Dragon Ball character popularity poll voted on by Weekly Shōnen Jump readers,<ref name="WSJ polls"></ref> and was also voted the third most popular character by fans of the series for the 2004 book Dragon Ball Forever.<ref></ref> Due to the popularity of Gohan, other merchandise, such as action figures, video games, and clothing have featured Gohan in Japan and in various countries around the world. In an interview featured in the second Dragon Ball GT Perfect Files, a companion book released in December 1997 by Shueisha's Jump Comics Selection imprint, Masako Nozawa, Gohan's voice actress, stated that her favorite episode voicing Gohan was "Sorry, Robot-san - The Desert of Vanishing Tears".<ref></ref> Saffron Henderson, Gohan's original English voice actor, has stated she felt protective of the role and considers it to be one of her favorites.<ref></ref> In addition, Gohan's original Funimation voice actor, Stephanie Nadolny has said that playing Gohan was a unique and much-loved experience.<ref name="Mania"></ref> C.J. A. Glover of Moviepilot ranked Gohan his third favorite comic character, admitting Gohan "has always been somewhat of an idol to me" as he related to bottling up his anger and being a gentle person that, when snapping, "would let loose and it would be hard to bottle it back up again." In conclusion, Glover wrote that Gohan was definitely "one of my favorite anime and manga characters ever."<ref></ref> Gohan's relationship with mentor Piccolo during the Saiyan arc was praised,<ref></ref> being seen as "complex" and "culminating in a truly emotional and inspiring moment that one doesn't often expect from your average animated series."<ref></ref> Tomoko Hiroki from Bandai Namco considered Gohan her favorite character from the series.<ref></ref>
Most of Gohan's praise is derived from his role in the Cell arc of Dragon Ball Z. IGN writer D. F. Smith liked how during the Cell Games, Gohan has more screentime than Goku, and praised his scenes as one of the biggest moments from said story arc.<ref></ref> Theron Martin from Anime News Network celebrated Gohan's development in the Cell Games as he had grown up and become stronger.<ref></ref> The character's battles against Cell during the arc and his transformation into a Super Saiyan 2 were positively received as some of the best in the entire series,<ref></ref><ref name="capsulecomputers.com.au"></ref> the fight additionally being praised for its animation.<ref></ref> Both Anime Focus<ref></ref> and John Begley believed Dragon Ball Z could have ended with Gohan's defeat of Cell, the latter reasoning concluding it there would have "provided it a sense of poignancy and closure that retroactively would have provided a greater sense of depth and purpose."<ref></ref> Luke Ryan Baldock of The Hollywood News felt Gohan's progression was the focus of the Cell Games and that he had begun to match his father Goku in ability, calling their relationship "a fascinating one to watch unfold."<ref></ref> Reviewer Nick Hartel expressed that the "continuing elevation of Gohan" pleased him and the last episodes of the Cell storyline "properly sees this is paid off from a narrative standpoint."<ref></ref> Reviewer Todd Douglass Jr. wrote that the series split its focus between Goku and Gohan during the start of the series as they grew on their own, finding it to be "an interesting way to handle the flow of story but also important because it shows Gohan's growth as a person and warrior."<ref></ref>
Gohan's role and character in the latter part of the series was met with more mixed reviews. Reviewer Michael Zupan wrote of his disappointment with the character, "Gohan was once the most promising warrior in the galaxy, with the potential to even best his father, Goku… and this is where he's at seven years later? Dressing up in a green dress, black tights and a Lost in Space helmet to put the beat down on robbers?"<ref></ref>
Anime Focus found humor in his Great Saiyaman guise and his "clumsy but earnest" relationship with Videl, but thought it "mostly uninspired and draggy and feels very flat after the high flying antics of previous arcs."<ref></ref> Reviewer Brad Stephenson argued that the character growing older and becoming more "emotionally complex" provided Dragon Ball Z "with a true sense of progression and meaning." While controversial, lighthearted and more casual fans of the show tend to enjoy the Saiyaman saga due to its comedic tone and way of portraying larger than life figures in relatable real life situations.<ref></ref> Josh Begley enjoyed Gohan trying to find his place in high school and his role as big brother to Goten, but thought his Great Saiyaman guise was not comedic and became embarrassed on the character's behalf.<ref></ref> Anime Focus was impressed with his fight against Majin Buu after he was powered up, calling it a "rare chance for him to flex his muscles" by giving Majin Buu "an impressive beatdown".<ref></ref>
Sam Leach from Anime News Network noted that fans of the series tend to joke Piccolo is a better paternal figure to Gohan than his actual father, Goku, and felt that Dragon Ball Super emphasized it more when Piccolo started training him again.<ref></ref> On the other hand, Leach criticized how Super tries to teach "life lessons" to a mature Gohan. The fact that Piccolo calls him "arrogant", despite Gohan's kindness and humility, was seen as a bad plot point by the reviewer.<ref></ref> Mark Sammut of TheGamer notes that Gohan occasionally performs the dab move (as The Great Saiyaman), decades before it became a popular dance move in American popular culture.<ref></ref>
