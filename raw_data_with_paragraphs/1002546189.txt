Hongwu Emperor

==== "Japanese" pirates ====
Hongwu sent a harsh message to the Japanese that his army would "capture and exterminate Wokou, head straight for your country, and put your king in bonds".<ref></ref> In fact, many of the "Wokou" and "dongyi" raiding his coasts were Chinese,<ref>.</ref><ref name=list/> and Hongwu's response was almost entirely passive. The Ashikaga shōgun cheekily replied "Your great empire may be able to invade Japan, but our small state is not short of a strategy to defend ourselves."<ref name=litt>.</ref> The necessity of protecting his state against the Northern Yuan remnants<ref>.</ref> meant that the most Hongwu was able to accomplish against Japan was a series of "haijin" measures. Private foreign trade was made punishable by death, with the collective punishment;<ref>.</ref> ships, docks, and shipyards were destroyed, and ports were sabotaged.<ref name=lifo>.</ref> The plan's aim seems to have been to use Japan's need for Chinese goods to force them to terms.<ref name=litt/> The plan was at odds with Chinese tradition and extremely counterproductive as it tied up resources. For example, 74 coastal garrisons had to be established from Guangzhou to Shandong, though they were often manned by local gangs.<ref name=lifo/> Hongwu's measures limited tax receipts, impoverished and provoked both coastal Chinese and Japanese against the Hongwu regime,<ref name=litt/> and actually increased piracy-<ref name=list>.</ref> offering too little as a reward for good behavior and enticement for Japanese authorities to root out their own smugglers and pirates.<ref name=litt/> Regardless of the policy, piracy had dropped to negligible levels by the time of its abolition in 1568.<ref name=list/>
Nonetheless, the sea ban was added by Hongwu to his Ancestral Injunctions<ref name=lifo/> and so continued to be broadly enforced through most of the rest of his dynasty: for the next two centuries, the rich farmland of the south and the military theaters of the north were linked only by the Jinghang Canal.<ref>.</ref>
Despite the deep distrust, in Hongwu's Ancestral Injunctions, he listed Japan along with 14 other countries as "countries against which campaigns shall not be launched", and advised his descendants to maintain peace with them.<ref></ref>
==== Byzantine Empire ====
The History of Ming, compiled during the early Qing dynasty, describes how Hongwu met with an alleged merchant of Fulin (拂菻; the Byzantine Empire) named "Nieh-ku-lun" . In September 1371, he had the man sent back to his native country with a letter announcing the History of the Ming dynasty to his ruler (i.e. John V Palaiologos).<ref name="halsall 2000"></ref><ref name="Grant2005"></ref><ref name="Hirth1885"></ref> It is speculated that the merchant was actually a former bishop of Khanbaliq (Beijing) called Nicolaus de Bentra, sent by Pope John XXII to replace Archbishop John of Montecorvino in 1333.<ref name="halsall 2000"/><ref name="Luttwak2009 2"></ref> The History of Ming goes on to explain that contacts between China and Fu lin ceased after this point, and diplomats of the great western sea (the Mediterranean Sea) did not appear in China again until the 16th century, with the Italian Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci.<ref name="halsall 2000"/>
== Death ==
After a 30-year reign, The Hongwu Emperor died on 24 June 1398 at the age of 69. After his death, his physicians were penalized. He was buried at Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum on the Purple Mountain, in the east of Nanjing. The mass sacrifice of concubines after the emperor's death, a practice long disappeared among Chinese dynasties, was revived by Zhu Yuanzhang, probably to clear potential obstacles to the reign of his chosen successor. At least 38 concubines were killed as part of Hongwu's Human sacrifice#China.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
== Assessment ==
Historians consider Hongwu as one of the most significant emperors of China. As Patricia Buckley Ebrey puts it, "Seldom has the course of Chinese history been influenced by a single personality as much as it was by the founder of the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang."<ref name="Ebrey 190">Ebrey, "Cambridge Illustrated History of China", pg. 190</ref> His rise to power was fast despite his having a poor and humble origin. In 11 years, he went from being a penniless monk to the most powerful warlord in China. Five years later, he became emperor of China. Simon Leys described him this way: <blockquote>'an adventurer from peasant stock, poorly educated, a man of action, a bold and shrewd tactician, a visionary mind, in many respects a creative genius; naturally coarse, cynical, and ruthless, he eventually showed symptoms of paranoia, bordering on psychopathy.'<ref>Simon Leys, 'Ravished by Oranges' in New York Review of Books 20 December 2007 p.8</ref></blockquote>
