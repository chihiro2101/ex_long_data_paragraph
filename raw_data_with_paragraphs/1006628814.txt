Royal Academy of Dramatic Art

==History==
RADA was founded on 25 April 1904<ref></ref> by actor-manager Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, at His Majesty's Theatre in the Haymarket, West End. In 1905, RADA moved to 52 Gower Street, and a managing council was set up to oversee the school. Its members included George Bernard Shaw, who later donated his royalties from his play Pygmalion to RADA, and gave lectures to students at the school.<ref> urltoken Hidden London: RADA</ref> In 1920, RADA was granted a Royal Charter, and in 1921, a new theatre was built on Malet Street, behind the Gower Street buildings. Edward VIII opened the theatre. In 1923, John Gielgud studied at RADA for a year. He later became President of the academy, and its first honorary fellow. 1924 saw RADA's first government subsidy, a grant of £500. The Gower Street buildings were torn down in 1927, and replaced with a new building, financed by George Bernard Shaw, who also left one third of his royalties to the academy on his death in 1950. The academy has received other government funding at various times throughout its history, including a £22.7m grant from the Arts Council National Lottery Board, which was used to renovate its premises, and rebuild the Jerwood Vanbrugh Theatre.
In 2000 the Academy founded RADA Enterprises Ltd, now known as RADA Business, providing training programmes and coaching for organisations and individuals in communications and team building that uses drama training techniques in a business context. The profits are fed back into the Academy to help cover the costs.<ref> urltoken RADA Business: About Us</ref>
In 2001, RADA joined with the London Contemporary Dance School to create the UK's first Conservatoire for Dance and Drama (CDD).<ref> urltoken Conservatoire for Dance and Drama schools</ref>RADA left the CDD in August 2019 to become an independent higher education provider.<ref> urltoken RADA and LAMDA leave CDD</ref> RADA is also a founder member of the Federation of Drama Schools, established in 2017.<ref> urltoken Federation of Drama Schools: Partner Schools</ref>
In 2011, The Lir Academy was established in association with RADA at Trinity College Dublin, with the partnership of the Cathal Ryan Trust. Following RADA’s conservatoire-style, practical theatre training, The Lir Academy modelled its courses after the London-based school.<ref></ref>
RADA has been registered with the Office for Students as a higher education institution since July 2018. 
In July 2020, Director Edward Kemp responded to the Black Lives Matter movement by acknowledging that "RADA has been and currently is institutionally racist" and set out in detail its plans to change.<ref></ref>

The Goodge Street and Euston Square underground stations are both within walking distance.<ref></ref>

The Drill Hall is a Grade II listed building with a long performing arts history, and was where Nijinsky rehearsed with Diaghilev’s Ballet Russes in 1911.<ref></ref> This venue has a 200-seat space, the Studio Theatre, and a 50-seat space, the Club Theatre.<ref></ref>
In April 2016, planning permission was granted for the redevelopment of the Chenies Street premises as part of the Richard Attenborough Campaign.
