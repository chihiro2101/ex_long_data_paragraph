MSN

=== News ===
Microsoft News (previously named MSN News and Bing News) is a news aggregator and service that features news headlines and articles chosen by editors. The app includes sections for top stories, U.S., world, money, technology, entertainment, opinion, sports, and crime, along with other miscellaneous stories. It allows users to set their own personalized favorite topics and sources, receive notifications of breaking news though alerts, filter preferred news sources, and alter font sizes to make articles easier to read.<ref name=WindowsCentral></ref>
Originally, News included an RSS feed, but that capability was removed; Microsoft currently only allows users to subscribe to specified news sources, thereby curating news. <ref></ref> News uses the chaseable live tile feature introduced in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. If a user clicks on the News Start menu tile when a particular story is shown, the user will see a link to that story at the top of the app when it launches.<ref></ref>
=== Weather ===
MSN Weather (originally named Bing Weather) shows weather from a user's current location or any other location worldwide, and it allows users to define their favorite places, which will synchronize back to the web portal and across devices. Users can pin Weather tiles to the Start menu to see local weather conditions from multiple locations at a glance. It also offers satellite maps and has information regarding ski resorts.<ref name=SearchEngineLand></ref> The app receives its weather conditions and forecasts from a variety of sources internationally.<ref name=WideUpdates></ref> Weather uses weather conditions as the background, making it the only app that does not have a light/dark switch in Windows 10. Weather is not available for iOS; however, it comes preinstalled on the Nokia 215 phone from Microsoft Mobile that runs Series 30+; it is currently the only feature phone to have the app built-in.<ref name="LumiaConversations" />

As of May 2015, Microsoft rebranded the service to MSN Travel.<ref></ref> In August 2015, MSN Travel flight search pages changed from being powered by Kayak.com to its competitor Skyscanner.
=== Older mobile apps ===
Microsoft first offered content from its MSN web portal on mobile devices in the early 2000s, through a service it called Pocket MSN (in line with its Pocket PC products of the era) and later renamed MSN Mobile. The original MSN Mobile software was preloaded on many cell phones and PDAs, and usually provided access to legacy MSN services like blogs (MSN Spaces), email (Hotmail), instant messaging (MSN Messenger), and web search (now called Bing). Some wireless carriers charged a premium to access it. As many former MSN properties were spun off to Bing, Windows Live, and other successors in late 2000s, the Microsoft Mobile Services division took over the development of mobile apps related to those services.
In the meantime, Microsoft's MSN apps took on a more content-related focus, as did the web portal itself. Previous versions of MSN apps that were bundled with Windows Mobile and early versions of Windows Phone,<ref name=Softpedia></ref> as well as MSN apps for Android and iOS devices in the early 2010s, were primarily repositories for news articles found on MSN.com.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> Other earlier MSN mobile apps included versions of MSN Weather and MSN Money for Windows Mobile 6.5,<ref name=iStartedSomething1></ref><ref name=PocketsNow1></ref><ref name=WMPowerUser2></ref> and 'MSN Money Stocks' and a men's magazine called 'MSN OnIt' for Windows Phone 7.<ref name=247PressRelease></ref><ref name=WMPowerUser3></ref>
== International ==
Microsoft's world headquarters is in the United States, so the main MSN website is based there. However, MSN has offered various international versions of its portal since its inception in 1995 for dozens of countries around the world.<ref name="msnworldwide" /> A list of international MSN affiliates is available at MSN Worldwide.<ref></ref>
Following the redesign and relaunch of the MSN web portal in 2014, most international MSN websites share the same layout as the U.S. website and are largely indistinguishable from it, aside from their content. There were two exceptions: ninemsn, a longtime partnership between Microsoft and the Nine Network in Australia that launched in 1997 (Microsoft sold its stake in the venture and 2013 and ended its co-branding with Nine in 2016);<ref name="MumbrellaRebrand"></ref> and MSN China, an entirely customized version of MSN for China (Microsoft discontinued the portal in 2016, replacing it with a page that links to a number of other Chinese websites).<ref name=MSN-China-shut-down></ref>

The MSN web app provide users information from sources that publish to MSN.
Microsoft launched these apps along with the 2014 redesign of the MSN web portal, rebranding many of the Bing apps that originally shipped with Windows and Windows Phone. News, Weather, Sports, Money, and Travel first shipped with Windows 8, while Health & Fitness and Food & Drink first appeared in Windows 8.1.<ref name=WMPowerUser></ref><ref name=PhoneArena1></ref> In December 2014, the apps became available across all the other major mobile device platforms as well: iOS, Android, and Fire OS.<ref name=WinBetamsnapps></ref><ref></ref><ref name=msnappsdroidlife></ref><ref name=AndroidAndMe></ref><ref name=msnappsAndroidCentral></ref>
The apps allow users a reasonable amount of freedom to decide which sources provide information. Each app has its own color code that is used on the live tile and internally. Originally, each app brought a unified experience with the MSN website and synchronized preferences across devices; for example, setting a list of stocks to watch on MSN.com would show the same data on the MSN Money app on all devices where the user was signed in with a Microsoft account. The synchronization was dropped when the apps were rebuilt for Windows 10.
There are currently four apps in the suite: News, Weather, Sports, and Money.<ref name=cnetrebrandapps></ref> In July 2015, Microsoft announced the discontinuation of the Food & Drink, Health & Fitness, and Travel apps on all platforms, and that they will not be bundled with Windows 10; those three apps are no longer offered.<ref name=pcw-appsdiscontinued></ref>
After Microsoft's acquisition of Microsoft Mobile, Microsoft also started bundling MSN services with its Series 30+, though the only supported model was the Nokia 215.<ref name=GSMArena></ref><ref name=TheMicrosoftNetworkAh></ref><ref name="LumiaConversations"></ref> In addition to these apps, Microsoft developed a MSN China#Mobile apps specifically for MSN China.
