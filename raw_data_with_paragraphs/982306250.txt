== Events ==
Prince Masahito became emperor following the abdication of his emperor-father. The succession (the senso) was considered to have been received by the new monarch; and shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Mizunoo is said to have acceded (the sokui).<ref>Titsingh, urltoken p. 410; Varley, H. Paul. (1980). Jinnō Shōtōki, p. 44; n.b., a distinct act of senso is unrecognized prior to Emperor Tenji; and all sovereigns except Jitō, Yōzei, Go-Toba, and Fushimi have senso and sokui in the same year until the reign of Emperor Go-Murakami.</ref> The events during his lifetime shed some light on his reign. The years of Go-Mizunoo's reign correspond with a period in which Tokugawa Hidetada and Tokugawa Iemitsu were leaders at the pinnacle of the Tokugawa shogunate.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.
In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career. During Go-Mizunoo's reign, this apex of the Daijō-kan included:
* Kampaku, Kujō Yukiie, 1608–1612
* Kampaku, Takatsukasa Nobuhisa, 1612–1615
* Kampaku, Nijō Akizane, 1615–1619
* Kampaku, Kujō Yukiie, 1619–1623
* Kampaku, Konoe Nobuhiro, 1623–1629.<ref> urltoken 近衛家（摂家） </ref>
* Kampaku, Ichijō Akiyoshi, 1629
* Sadaijin
* Udaijin, Konoe Nobuhiro, 1619.<ref name="ponsonby113"/>

* Dainagon

The years of Go-Mizunoo's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or nengō.<ref name="titsingh410"/>
