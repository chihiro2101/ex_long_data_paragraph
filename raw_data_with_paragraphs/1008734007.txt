== Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians ==
The second edition (Grove II), in five volumes, was edited by Fuller Maitland and published from 1904 to 1910, this time as Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians. The individual volumes of the second edition were reprinted many times. An American Supplement edited by Waldo Selden Pratt and Charles N. Boyd was published in 1920 in Philadelphia by Theodore Presser.<ref name=history /> This edition removed the first edition's beginning date of 1450,<ref>Grove II, vol. 1, p. vii</ref> though important earlier composers and theorists are still missing from this edition.

The third edition (Grove III), also in five volumes, was an extensive revision of the 2nd edition; it was edited by H. C. Colles and published in 1927.<ref name=Blom1970>Blom 1954 (1970 reprint), p. iv.</ref> The 3rd edition was reprinted several times. An American Supplement was published in the U.S. in 1927, and also later reprinted separately.
An extra-large Supplementary Volume also edited by Colles was published in 1940 and called the fourth edition (Grove IV).<ref name=history /><ref>For the 4th edition Supplementary Volume published in New York, see . For the 4th edition Supplementary Volume published in London, see .</ref> A reprint of the 3rd edition with some corrections, was released at the same time. The five-volume 3rd edition, with the Supplementary Volume as volume 6, and the American Supplement of the 3rd edition as volume 7, were reprinted together as a set in 1945.<ref>For the reprinted American Supplement published in New York, see .</ref>
The fifth edition (Grove V), in nine volumes, was edited by Eric Blom and published in 1954. This was the most thoroughgoing revision of the work since its inception, with many articles rewritten in a more modern style and a large number of entirely new articles. Many of the articles were written by Blom personally, or translated by him. An additional Supplementary Volume prepared by Eric Blom and completed by Denis Stevens after Blom's death in 1959, was issued in 1961. The fifth edition was reprinted in 1966, 1968, 1970, 1973, and 1975,<ref>Blom 1954.</ref> each time with numerous corrections, updates, and other small changes.<ref name=history />
== The New Grove ==

===Spin-offs===
Some sections of The New Grove were also issued as small sets and individual books on particular topics. These typically were enhanced with expanded and updated material and included individual and grouped composer biographies,<ref name=oestreich20010121/> a four-volume dictionary of American music (1984; revised 2013, 8 vols.),<ref>The New Grove Dictionary of American Music, 4 volumes, 1984. ; 2013 (8 volumes): .</ref> a three-volume dictionary of musical instruments (1984),<ref>The New Grove Dictionary of Musical Instruments, 1984. .</ref> a four-volume dictionary of opera (1992).,<ref>The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, 1992. </ref> and a volume on women composers (1994).<ref>The New Grove Dictionary of Women Composers, 1994. </ref>
=== Second edition ===
The second edition under this title (the seventh overall) was published in 2001, in 29 volumes. It was also made available by subscription on the internet in a service called Grove Music Online.<ref> urltoken Grove Music Online – online version of the 2001 edition</ref> It was again edited by Stanley Sadie, and the executive editor was John Tyrrell. It was originally to be released on CD-ROM as well, but this plan was dropped. As Sadie writes in the preface, "The biggest single expansion in the present edition has been in the coverage of 20th-century composers".
This edition was subjected to negative criticism (e.g. in Private Eye) owing to the significant number of typographical and factual errors that it contained.<ref>Michael Lorenz, urltoken "'Franz Schubert' in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (2001)" (Vienna, 2013).</ref> Two volumes were re-issued in corrected versions after production errors originally caused the omission of sections of Igor Stravinsky's worklist and Richard Wagner's bibliography.

Publication of the second edition of The New Grove was accompanied by a Web-based version, Grove Music Online. It too, attracted some initial criticism, for example for the way in which images were not incorporated into the text but kept separate.

==Hoaxes and parodies==
Two non-existent composers have appeared in the work:
Dag Henrik Esrum-Hellerup was the subject of a hoax entry in the 1980 New Grove. Esrum-Hellerup's surname derives from a Danish village and a suburb of Copenhagen.<ref> urltoken Foreign-language webpage showing the original dictionary entry </ref> The writer of the entry was Robert Layton. Though successfully introduced into the encyclopaedia, Esrum-Hellerup appeared in the first printing only: soon exposed as a hoax, the entry was removed and the space filled with an illustration.<ref name=oestreich20010121></ref><ref></ref> In 1983, the Danish organist Henry Palsmar founded an amateur choir, the Esrum-Hellerup Choir, along with several former pupils of the Song School, St. Annae Gymnasium in Copenhagen.<ref> urltoken Foreign-language webpage for the Choir </ref>
Guglielmo Baldini was the name of a non-existent composer who was the subject of a hoax entry in the 1980 edition. Unlike Esrum-Hellerup, Baldini was not a modern creation: his name and biography were in fact created almost a century earlier by the renowned German musicologist Hugo Riemann. The New Grove entry on Baldini was supported by a fictional reference in the form of an article supposedly in the Archiv für Freiburger Diözesan Geschichte. Though successfully introduced into the encyclopaedia, Baldini appeared in the first printing only: soon exposed as a hoax, the entry was removed.<ref name=oestreich20010121/>
Seven parody entries, written by contributors to the 1980 edition, and full of musical puns and dictionary in-jokes, were published in the February 1981 issue of The Musical Times (which was also edited by Stanley Sadie at the time).<ref>Stanley Sadie and others urltoken "The New Grove", in The Musical Times, Vol. 122, no. 1656 (February 1981), pp. 89–91.</ref> These entries never appeared in the dictionary itself and are:
* Knees Up Mother Brown (b. 1550; d. Wapping, 3 January 1611)
* Ear-flute
* Hameln Hamelin
* Genghis Khan (Tamurlane) (b. Ulan Bator, c. 1880; d. New York, 22 November 1980)
* Stainglit (Nevers), Sait d'Ail (fl Middle Ages) &ndash; i.e. "Stanley Sadie", following the example of Luis van Rooten
* Toblerone
* Verdi, Lasagne 'Il Bolognese' (b. Bologna, 10 October 1813; d. Naples, 15 March 1867)

The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians is an encyclopedic dictionary of music and musicians. Along with the German-language Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart, it is one of the largest reference works on the history and theory of music. Earlier editions were published under the titles A Dictionary of Music and Musicians, and Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians; the work has gone through several editions since the 19th century and is widely used. In recent years it has been made available as an electronic resource called Grove Music Online, which is now an important part of Oxford Music Online.
