Chesham

==Transport==
===Roads===
In contrast to other towns in south Buckinghamshire, Chesham historically was not well served by road transport links. The stage coach bypassed the town and, unlike Amersham, there were no turnpikes and consequently roads were poorly maintained. Significant change occurred in the post Second World War period with the opening of the M1 motorway. The A416 now runs through the town, from Amersham to Berkhamsted, and connects the town to the more recently upgraded A41. The A416 was diverted around the High Street and later upgraded to be dual-lane. Although these improvements enable more through traffic, traffic congestion has increased. Chesham's High Street was pedestrianised in 1990 and the benefits to the High Street have been felt ever since. Whilst some of the previous bustle has been lost, the impact of pedestrianisation has generally been positive.
===Rail===
Chesham tube station, close to the town centre, is the terminus for the Chesham branch, a single track spur off the London Underground Metropolitan line connecting to Chalfont and Latimer station. The station was opened on 8 July 1889 by the Metropolitan Railway (MR). The line had been intended to extend to Tring railway station with connections to the London and North Western Railways West Coast Main Line. However, before work was begun, the MR chose an alternative route across the Chilterns. The idea was abandoned and the Metropolitan line reached Amersham and Aylesbury. There were some sizeable goods yards beyond the station, which were closed and now function as Waitrose's car park except for one portion occupied by a coal merchants.
In 1959 electrification of the Metropolitan line to Chesham provided a more reliable connection to London. Following the cessation of London Underground services to Aylesbury in 1961 and the closure of Ongar in 1994, Chesham has become the furthest location served from central London, in terms of both distance and travelling time. Prior to December 2010, apart from a few direct trains to London at peak times, a shuttle service operated to and from Chalfont and Latimer station. Since then the town has benefited from direct trains to London all day.<ref></ref>
The nearest National Rail connections are Amersham station, although the LU line also connects directly to Chalfont & Latimer station, from where the Metropolitan line and National Rail Chiltern Railways provide a joint service with Metropolitan line trains travelling to Baker Street station and Chiltern Railways trains travelling to Marylebone station. There is also access to London via Berkhamsted railway station on the West Coast Main Line.
===Bus services===
Bus companies running local services include Arriva, Carousel Buses, Red Rose, Redline and Red Eagle.
Residential areas of the town are connected with the central shopping-area. Chesham is also connected by services to nearby Amersham, and further afield to High Wycombe, Hemel Hempstead, and Uxbridge.<ref>
The main service in Chesham is the route 1/1A operated by Arriva and Carousel. It connects the Pond Park estate to Chesham Town Centre and on to Amersham, Holmer Green, Hazlemere, and High Wycombe, serving the Eden Bus Station.
Carousel Buses also operate the "Chiltern Hundreds" service 105 travelling through Chesham on its way from Hemel Hempstead, Bovingdon and Lye Green, on to Amersham, the Chalfonts, Gerrards Cross, Denham and Uxbridge.

Less frequent services run to Aylesbury and to surrounding villages.
===Car usage and parking===
There are six pay and display car parks in the town, managed by Chiltern District Council. This demand for parking reflects the relatively high car usage, a result of both affluence and the limited public transport provision in rural areas. As a consequence
Chiltern District has the 4th highest carbon footprint of all local authorities.<ref> urltoken Chiltern Community Partnership Retrieved, 27 August 2009</ref>
===Cycling===
There is limited provision for cycle use within the town. The town is one setting off point for exploring the Chilterns and cycling heritage trails have been developed by the district authority, two of which are centred on countryside around Chesham.<ref> urltoken Chiltern DC Claire Partnership Cycling Heritage Routes Retrieved, 27 August 2009</ref>
===Air transport===

==Education==
===Primary education===
Between the 1960s and the mid-1990s Primary education provision in Chesham was organised into First (ages 4–8) and Middle (ages 8&nbsp;– 12) with some Combined Schools taking pupils across the whole age range (4 -12). In 1996 the arrangements were modified and the age of transfer to Secondary education was changed to age 11. The schools still retain some elements of the previous arrangement reflected in their names. There are six Primary Schools within Chesham with catchment areas based on post codes: – Elmtree First School, Newtown Infant School, Brushwood Junior School, Thomas Harding Junior School, Ivingswood Academy (previously Little Spring Primary School), Waterside Combined School. Attendance by Chesham children at some of the village schools close to the town is popular.<ref> urltoken Bucks County Council Schools </ref>
===Secondary education===
At secondary level, Buckinghamshire continues to operate a system of selective education with pupils sitting the eleven plus exam to determine entry to either a Grammar school or Secondary modern (also known locally as an Upper School).<ref> urltoken Buckinghamshire Admission Information </ref> Two Secondary Schools are located in the town: – Chiltern Hills Academy, a co-educational Church of England Academy, previously known as Chesham Park Community College which was formed from the merger of Lowndes School and Cestreham School) and Chesham Grammar School, a co-educational grammar school, which until May 2010 was called Chesham High School. Chesham also falls within the catchment areas of two further grammar schools, Dr Challoner's Grammar School for boys' in Amersham and Dr Challoner's High School for girls in Little Chalfont.
In the Chiltern and South Bucks area around Chesham and over the county border in Hertfordshire there are also a number of independent fee-paying schools providing education between ages 4–13 and up to age 18. Chesham Preparatory School is an independent school which opened in 1938 in the town and shortly after relocated to the outskirts of Chesham at Orchard Leigh, providing fee-paying and scholarship-supported education.<ref> urltoken Chesham Preparatory School</ref>

===Town twinning and cultural exchanges===
Chesham has twinned with three towns in other countries. It is organised by the Chesham Town Twinning Association. The first link-up was in 1980 with Friedrichsdorf,<ref name="Friedrichsdorf twinnings"></ref> at the foot of the Taunus Hills near Frankfurt, Germany. Next followed the association with Houilles,<ref name="Houilles twinning"></ref><ref name="Archant twinning"></ref> a commune of Paris, France, in 1986 and thirdly, in 1995 a tie-up with Archena, in the Murcia region of Spain.<ref> urltoken Chesham Town Twinning Association </ref>
Some organisations also have international links. Emmanuel Church is linked with a church in Prague, Czech Republic. Chesham British Legion is linked with its Canadian equivalent in Buckingham, Quebec. Ley Hill Methodist Church is linked with Skopje Methodist Church in Macedonia.
==Media, communications and filmography==
===Local news media===
The local newspaper covering Chesham and the surrounding area, although it no longer has an office based in the town, is the Buckinghamshire Examiner founded in 1889.<ref></ref> Another Buckinghamshire newspaper with a circulation area covering Chesham is the Bucks Free Press.<ref> urltoken Bucks Free Press </ref> The non-commercial community news blog dedicated to Chesham and nearby villages is Chiltern Voice,<ref> urltoken Chiltern Voice</ref> which is also the name of the community radio station.
There is also a community website where residents can discuss local issues.
===TV and mobile phone signals===
Due to its position in a fold in the hill, TV and radio reception in Chesham can be poor and the town now has its own TV mast. In the 1970s, Chesham was one of the last towns in the south east to receive BBC2, and parts of it still cannot receive Channel 5. Houses taking their TV reception from the Chesham transmitter<ref> urltoken Chesham transmitter </ref> have vertically polarised aerials, whilst those in a good enough position receive their signal from the Crystal Palace Transmitter in London with horizontally polarised aerials&nbsp;– they always could receive BBC2 (and indeed Channel 4 & Channel 5). Digital terrestrial television coverage is patchy for much the same reason. Mobile phone reception can be poor in the steeper parts of Chesham and outlying villages.
