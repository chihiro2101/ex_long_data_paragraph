Pocahontas

==Early life==
Pocahontas's birth year is unknown, but some historians estimate it to have been around 1596.<ref name="Stebbins 2010"/> In A True Relation of Virginia (1608), Smith described meeting Pocahontas in the spring of 1608 when she was "a child of ten years old."<ref name="Smith93">Smith, urltoken True Relation , p. 93.</ref> In a 1616 letter, he again described her as she was in 1608, but this time as "a child of twelve or thirteen years of age."<ref name="Letter to Queen Anne">Smith.</ref>
Pocahontas was the daughter of Chief Powhatan, paramount chief of Tsenacommacah, an alliance of about 30 Algonquian-speaking groups and petty chiefdoms in Tidewater region.<ref>Huber, Margaret Williamson (January 12, 2011). urltoken "Powhatan (d. 1618)" urltoken Encyclopedia Virginia . Retrieved February 18, 2011.</ref> Her mother's name and origin are unknown, but she was probably of lowly status. Henry Spelman of Jamestown had lived among the Powhatan as an interpreter, and he noted that, when one of the paramount chief's many wives gave birth, she was returned to her place of origin and supported there by the paramount chief until she found another husband.<ref>Spelman, Relation. 1609.</ref> However, little is known about Pocahontas's mother, and it has been theorized that she died in childbirth.<ref></ref> The Mattaponi Reservation people are descendants of the Powhatans, and their oral tradition claims that Pocahontas's mother was the first wife of Powhatan, and that Pocahontas was named after her.<ref></ref>

According to colonist William Strachey, "Pocahontas" was a childhood nickname meaning "little wanton";<ref></ref> some interpret the meaning as "playful one."<ref name="Encyclopedia Virginia">Rountree, Helen C.

Historian William Stith claimed that "her real name, it seems, was originally Matoax, which the Indians carefully concealed from the English and changed it to Pocahontas, out of a superstitious fear, lest they, by the knowledge of her true name, should be enabled to do her some hurt."<ref name="Stith1"></ref> According to anthropologist Helen C. Rountree, Pocahontas revealed her secret name to the colonists "only after she had taken another religious—baptismal—name" of Rebecca.<ref>Rountree, Helen C.

===Title and status===
Pocahontas is frequently viewed as a princess in popular culture. In 1841, William Watson Waldron of Trinity College, Dublin published Pocahontas, American Princess: and Other Poems, calling her "the beloved and only surviving daughter of the king."<ref>Waldron, William Watson. urltoken Pocahontas, American Princess: and Other Poems (New York: Dean and Trevett, 1841), p. 8.</ref> She was her father's "delight and darling", according to colonist Captain Ralph Hamor<ref>Hamor, True Discourse. p. 802.</ref> but she was not in line to inherit a position as a weroance, sub-chief, or mamanatowick (paramount chief). Instead, Powhatan's brothers and sisters and his sisters' children all stood in line to succeed him.<ref name="RountreeHelen_b">Rountree, Helen C.

==Interactions with the colonists==
===John Smith===
thumb
Pocahontas is most famously linked to colonist Captain John Smith, who arrived in Virginia with 100 other settlers in April 1607 where they built a fort on a marshy peninsula on the James River. The colonists had numerous encounters over the next several months with the people of Tsenacommacah—some of them friendly, some hostile. A hunting party led by Powhatan's close relative Opechancanough then captured Smith in December 1607 while he was exploring on the Chickahominy River and brought him to Powhatan's capital at Werowocomoco. In his 1608 account, Smith describes a great feast followed by a long talk with Powhatan. He does not mention Pocahontas in relation to his capture, and claims that they first met some months later.<ref>Lemay, J. A. Leo. Did Pocahontas Save Captain John Smith? Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 1992, p. 25. See also Birchfield, urltoken 'Did Pocahontas' .</ref>
<ref></ref> Margaret Huber suggests that Powhatan was attempting to bring Smith and the other colonists under his own authority. He offered Smith rule of the town of Capahosic, which was close to his capital at Werowocomoco, as he hoped to keep Smith and his men "nearby and better under control".<ref>Huber, Margaret Williamson (January 12, 2010). urltoken "Powhatan (d. 1618)". urltoken Encyclopedia Virginia . Retrieved February 18, 2011.</ref>
In 1616, Smith wrote a letter to Queen Anne of Denmark in anticipation of Pocahontas's visit to England. In this new account, his capture included the threat of his own death: "at the minute of my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her own brains to save mine; and not only that but so prevailed with her father, that I was safely conducted to Jamestown."<ref name="Letter to Queen Anne"/> He expanded on this in his 1624 , published long after the death of Pocahontas. He explained that he was captured and taken to the paramount chief where "two great stones were brought before Powhatan: then as many as could layd hands on him Smith, dragged him to them, and thereon laid his head, and being ready with their clubs, to beate out his braines, Pocahontas the Kings dearest daughter, when no intreaty could prevaile, got his head in her armes, and laid her owne upon his to save him from death."<ref></ref>
Karen Ordahl Kupperman suggests that Smith used such details to embroider his first account, thus producing a more dramatic second account of his encounter with Pocahontas as a heroine worthy of Queen Anne's audience. She argues that its later revision and publication was Smith's attempt to raise his own stock and reputation, as he had fallen from favor with the London Company which had funded the Jamestown enterprise.<ref> urltoken but not all writers are convinced, some suggesting the absence of certain corroborating evidence.<ref name = "Price243-4">Price, pp. 243–244</ref>
Early histories did establish that Pocahontas befriended Smith and the Jamestown colony. She often went to the settlement and played games with the boys there.<ref name="Strachey, Historie, p. 65"/> When the colonists were starving, "every once in four or five days, Pocahontas with her attendants brought him Smith so much provision that saved many of their lives that else for all this had starved with hunger."<ref>Smith, General History, p. 152.</ref> As the colonists expanded their settlement, the Powhatans felt that their lands were threatened, and conflicts arose again. In late 1609, an injury from a gunpowder explosion forced Smith to return to England for medical care, and the colonists told the Powhatans that he was dead. Pocahontas believed that account and stopped visiting Jamestown, but she learned that he was living in England when she traveled there with her husband John Rolfe.<ref>Smith, Generall Historie, 261.</ref>

Pocahontas's capture occurred in the context of the Anglo-Powhatan Wars, a conflict between the Jamestown settlers and the Indians which began late in the summer of 1609.<ref>Fausz, J. Frederick. "An 'Abundance of Blood Shed on Both Sides': England's First Indian War, 1609–1614".

Captain Samuel Argall, in the meantime, pursued contacts with Indian tribes in the northern portion of Powhatan's paramount chiefdom. The Patawomecks lived on the Potomac River and were not always loyal to Powhatan, and living with them was a young English interpreter named Henry Spelman. In March 1613, Argall learned that Pocahontas was visiting the Patawomeck village of Passapatanzy and living under the protection of the Weroance Iopassus (also known as Japazaws).<ref name="RountreeHelen_a">Rountree, Helen C.

With Spelman's help translating, Argall pressured Iopassus to assist in Pocahontas's capture by promising an alliance with the colonists against the Powhatans.<ref name="RountreeHelen_a" /> They tricked Pocahontas into boarding Argall's ship and held her for ransom, demanding the release of colonial prisoners held by her father and the return of various stolen weapons and tools.<ref>Argall, Letter to Nicholas Hawes. p. 754; Rountree, Helen C.

A long standoff ensued, during which the colonists kept Pocahontas captive.

In March 1614, the stand-off escalated to a violent confrontation between hundreds of colonists and Powhatan men on the Pamunkey River, and the colonists encountered a group of senior Indian leaders at Powhatan's capital of Matchcot. The colonists allowed Pocahontas to talk to her tribe when Powhatan arrived, and she reportedly rebuked him for valuing her "less than old swords, pieces, or axes". She said that she preferred to live with the colonists "who loved her".<ref>Dale, Letter to 'D.M.', p. 843–844.</ref>
===Possible first marriage===
Mattaponi tradition holds that Pocahontas's first husband was Kocoum, brother of the Patawomeck weroance Japazaws, and that Kocoum was killed by the colonists after his wife's capture in 1613.<ref></ref> Today's Patawomecks believe that Pocahontas and Kocoum had a daughter named Ka-Okee who was raised by the Patawomecks after her father's death and her mother's abduction.<ref></ref>
Kocoum's identity, location, and very existence have been widely debated among scholars for centuries; the only mention of a "Kocoum" in any English document is a brief statement written about 1616 by William Strachey in England that Pocahontas had been living married to a "private captaine called Kocoum" for two years.<ref>Strachey, Historie, p. 54</ref> She married John Rolfe in 1614, and no other records even hint at any previous husband, so some have suggested that Strachey was mistakenly referring to Rolfe himself, with the reference being later misunderstood as one of Powhatan's officers.<ref></ref>
===Marriage to John Rolfe===

During her stay in Henricus, Pocahontas met John Rolfe. Rolfe's English-born wife Sarah Hacker and child Bermuda had died on the way to Virginia after the wreck of the ship Sea Venture on the Summer Isles, also known as Bermuda. Rolfe established the Virginia plantation Varina Farms where he cultivated a new strain of tobacco. He was a pious man and agonized over the potential moral repercussions of marrying a heathen, though in fact Pocahontas had accepted the Christian faith and taken the baptismal name Rebecca. In a long letter to the governor requesting permission to wed her, he expressed his love for Pocahontas and his belief that he would be saving her soul. He wrote that he was
The couple were married on April 5, 1614 by chaplain Richard Buck, probably at Jamestown. For two years, they lived at Varina Farms across the James River from Henricus. Their son Thomas was born in January 1615.<ref></ref>
Their marriage created a climate of peace between the Jamestown colonists and Powhatan's tribes; it endured for eight years as the "Peace of Pocahontas".<ref name="nps.gov"/> In 1615, Ralph Hamor wrote, "Since the wedding we have had friendly commerce and trade not only with Powhatan but also with his subjects round about us."<ref>Hamor. True Discourse. p. 809.</ref> The marriage was controversial in the British court at the time because "a commoner" had "the audacity" to marry a "princess".<ref>Robert S. Tilton, Pocahontas: The Evolution of an American Narrative (Cambridge: CUP, 1994), p. 18</ref><ref>PBS, urltoken Race – The Power of an Illusion > Race Timeline</ref>
===England===
One goal of the Virginia Company of London was to convert Native Americans to Christianity, and the company saw an opportunity to promote further investment with the conversion of Pocahontas and her marriage to Rolfe, all of which also helped end the Anglo-Powhatan Wars. The company decided to bring Pocahontas to England as a symbol of the tamed New World "savage" and the success of the Virginia colony,<ref>Price, Love and Hate. p. 163.</ref> and the Rolfes arrived at the port of Plymouth on June 12, 1616.<ref></ref> They journeyed to London by coach, accompanied by 11 other Powhatans including a holy man named Tomocomo.<ref>Dale. Letter to Sir Ralph Winwood. p. 878.</ref> John Smith was living in London at the time while Pocahontas was in Plymouth, and she learned that he was still alive.<ref name="Smith, General History, page 261">Smith, General History. p. 261.</ref> Smith did not meet Pocahontas, but he wrote to Queen Anne of Denmark, the wife of King James, urging that Pocahontas be treated with respect as a royal visitor. He suggested that, if she were treated badly, her "present love to us and Christianity might turn to… scorn and fury", and England might lose the chance to "rightly have a Kingdom by her means".<ref name="Letter to Queen Anne"/>
Pocahontas was entertained at various social gatherings. On January 5, 1617, she and Tomocomo were brought before the king at the old Banqueting House in the Palace of Whitehall at a performance of Ben Jonson's masque The Vision of Delight. According to Smith, King James was so unprepossessing that neither Pocahontas nor Tomocomo realized whom they had met until it was explained to them afterward.<ref name="Smith, General History, page 261"/>
Pocahontas was not a princess in Powhatan culture, but the Virginia Company presented her as one to the English public because she was the daughter of an important chief. The inscription on a 1616 engraving of Pocahontas reads <small>"MATOAKA ALS REBECCA FILIA POTENTISS : PRINC : POWHATANI IMP:VIRGINIÆ"</small>, meaning "Matoaka, alias Rebecca, daughter of the most powerful prince of the Powhatan Empire of Virginia". Many English at this time recognized Powhatan as the ruler of an empire, and presumably accorded to his daughter what they considered appropriate status. Smith's letter to Queen Anne refers to "Powhatan their chief King".<ref name="Letter to Queen Anne"/> Cleric and travel writer Samuel Purchas recalled meeting Pocahontas in London, noting that she impressed those whom she met because she "carried her selfe as the daughter of a king".<ref name="Purchas, Hakluytus Posthumus, Vol 19, p 118">Purchas, Hakluytus Posthumus. Vol. 19 p. 118.</ref> When he met her again in London, Smith referred to her deferentially as a "King's daughter".<ref>Smith, Generall Historie, p. 261.</ref>
Pocahontas was apparently treated well in London. At the masque, her seats were described as "well placed"<ref>Qtd. in Herford and Simpson, eds. Ben Jonson, vol. 10, 568–569</ref> and, according to Purchas, London's Bishop John King "entertained her with festival state and pomp beyond what I have seen in his greate hospitalitie afforded to other ladies".<ref>Purchas, Hakluytus Posthumus, Vol. 19, p. 118</ref>
Not all the English were so impressed, however. Helen C. Rountree claims that there is no contemporaneous evidence to suggest that Pocahontas was regarded in England "as anything like royalty", despite the writings of John Smith. Rather, she was considered to be something of a curiosity, according to Roundtree, who suggests that she was merely "the Virginian woman" by most Englishmen.<ref name="RountreeHelen_b" />
Pocahontas and Rolfe lived in the suburb of Brentford, Middlesex for some time, as well as at Rolfe's family home at Heacham, Norfolk. In early 1617, Smith met the couple at a social gathering and wrote that, when Pocahontas saw him, "without any words, she turned about, obscured her face, as not seeming well contented", and was left alone for two or three hours. Later, they spoke more; Smith's record of what she said to him is fragmentary and enigmatic. She reminded him of the "courtesies she had done", saying, "you did promise Powhatan what was yours would be his, and he the like to you". She then discomfited him by calling him "father", explaining that Smith had called Powhatan "father" when he was a stranger in Virginia, "and by the same reason so must I do you". Smith did not accept this form of address because, he wrote, Pocahontas outranked him as "a King's daughter". Pocahontas then said, "with a well-set countenance":
Finally, Pocahontas told Smith that she and her tribe had thought him dead, but her father had told Tomocomo to seek him "because your countrymen will lie much".<ref name="Smith, General History, page 261"/>
==Death==

In March 1617, Rolfe and Pocahontas boarded a ship to return to Virginia, but they sailed only as far as Gravesend on the river Thames when Pocahontas became gravely ill.<ref>Price, Love and Hate. p. 182.</ref> She was taken ashore and died at the approximate age of 21. It is not known what caused her death, but theories range from pneumonia, smallpox, or tuberculosis to her being poisoned.<ref>Dr. Linwood "Little Bear" Custalow and Angela L.

Pocahontas's funeral took place on March 21, 1617, in the parish of St George's Church, Gravesend.<ref></ref> Her grave is thought to be underneath the church's chancel, though that church was destroyed in a fire in 1727 and its exact site is unknown.<ref></ref> Her memory is honored with a life-sized bronze statue at St. George's Church by William Ordway Partridge.<ref name="gravesham.gov.uk"></ref>

Pocahontas , ; born Matoaka, known as Amonute, 1596 – March 1617) was a Native American<ref name=VIwriting></ref><ref> urltoken Karenne Wood, ed., The Virginia Indian Heritage Trail , Charlottesville, VA: Virginia Foundation for the Humanities, 2007.</ref><ref name=Poca></ref> woman, belonging to the Powhatan, notable for her association with the colonial settlement at Jamestown, Virginia. She was the daughter of Powhatan, the paramount chief<ref name=VIwriting /> of a network of tributary tribes in the Tsenacommacah, encompassing the Tidewater region of Virginia.
Pocahontas was captured and held for ransom by the Colonists during hostilities in 1613. During her captivity, she was encouraged to convert to Christianity and was baptized under the name Rebecca. She married tobacco planter John Rolfe in April 1614 aged about 17 or 18, and she bore their son Thomas Rolfe in January 1615.<ref name="Stebbins 2010"></ref>
In 1616, the Rolfes travelled to London where Pocahontas was presented to English society as an example of the Noble savage in hopes of stimulating investment in the Jamestown settlement. On this trip she may have met Squanto, a Patuxet from New England.<ref></ref> She became something of a celebrity, was elegantly fêted, and attended a masque at Whitehall Palace. In 1617, the Rolfes set sail for Virginia, but Pocahontas died at Gravesend of unknown causes, aged 20 or 21. She was buried in St George's Church, Gravesend, in England, but her grave's exact location is unknown because the church was rebuilt after a fire destroyed it.<ref name="Stebbins 2010"/>
