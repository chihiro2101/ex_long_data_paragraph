Imperial War Museum

===First World War centenary: 2014===
In August 2009 the museum announced the creation of the Imperial War Museum Foundation. Chaired by Jonathon Harmsworth the foundation was charged with raising funds to support the redevelopment of Imperial War Museum London's permanent galleries.<ref>Steel, Patrick (August 2009) 'IWM sets up foundation to fund gallery revamp' Museums Journal Volume 109 No. 8, p. 6</ref> In December 2010 plans were announced to redevelop IWM London's First World War gallery in time for the conflict's centenary in 2014,<ref>,</ref> and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge became the foundation's patron.<ref></ref> In a speech at IWM London on 11 October 2012, Prime Minister David Cameron announced an additional £5&nbsp;million of government funding to support the museum's redevelopment, as part of funding arrangements to facilitate national centenary commemorations.<ref></ref> The £40&nbsp;million redevelopment, designed by Foster and Partners, provides new gallery spaces dedicated to the history of the First World War, a new central hall, easier navigation and improved visitor facilities, access and circulation.<ref name=transformiwm></ref><ref></ref> In preparation for building work, a number of galleries were closed during September 2012,<ref></ref> and by December 2012 over sixty large objects had been removed from the IWM London atrium for conservation at Duxford.<ref></ref> To allow building work to go ahead, IWM London closed to the public on 2 January 2013. The museum partially reopened on 29 July 2013.<ref></ref>
IWM London was formally reopened on 17 July 2014 by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge.
==Branches==
From the 1970s onwards the Imperial War Museum began to expand onto other sites. The first branch, Imperial War Museum Duxford opened to the public on a regular basis in June 1976.<ref>Garvey, Jude (1982) A guide to the transport museums of Great Britain (London: Pelham Books) 0720714044 p. 100</ref> became a branch of the museum in 1978.<ref name="Wingate"></ref> The Cabinet War Rooms opened in 1984,<ref> urltoken and Imperial War Museum North in 2002.<ref> urltoken 
===Imperial War Museum London===
====Architecture and layout====
The museum has occupied the former Bethlem Royal Hospital on Lambeth Road since 1936. The hospital building was designed by the hospital surveyor, James Lewis, from plans submitted by John Gandy and other architects, and construction completed in October 1814. The hospital consisted of a range of buildings 580 feet long with a basement and three storeys, parallel to Lambeth Road, with a central entrance under a portico.<ref name=britishhistoryonline/>
The building was substantially altered in 1835 by architect Sydney Smirke. In order to provide more space, he added blocks at either end of the frontage, and galleried wings on either side of the central portion. He also added a small single-storey lodge, still in existence, at the Lambeth Road gate. Later, between 1844 and 1846, the central cupola was replaced with a copper-clad dome in order to expand the chapel beneath. The building also featured a theatre in a building to the rear of the site.<ref name=britishhistoryonline>
</ref>
The building remained substantially unchanged until vacated by the hospital in 1930. After the freehold was purchased by Lord Rothermere, the wings were demolished to leave the original central portion (with the dome now appearing disproportionately tall) and Smirke's later wings. When the museum moved into the building in 1936 the ground floor of the central portion was occupied by the principal art gallery, with the east wing housing the Naval gallery and the west wing the Army gallery. The Air Force gallery was housed in the former theatre. The first floor comprised further art galleries (including rooms dedicated to Sir William Orpen and Sir John Lavery), a gallery on women's war work, and exhibits relating to transport and signals. The first floor also housed the museum's photograph collection. The second floor housed the museum's library in its west wing, and in the east wing the map collection and stored pictures and drawings.<ref>'War Museum in Its New Home – Arrangement of the Exhibits', The Times 16 June 1936, Issue 47402, page 14 column B</ref> This division of exhibits by service, and by civil or military activity, persisted until a wide-ranging redisplay of the galleries from the 1960s onwards. In September 1972 the building received Grade II listed building status.<ref></ref>
The original hospital building is now largely occupied by corporate offices. The 1966 extension houses the library, art store, and document archives while the 1980s redevelopments created exhibition space over five floors. The first stage created 8,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> of gallery space of which 4,600&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> was new, and the second provided a further 1,600&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=arupjournal/> The final phase, the Southwest Infill, was partly funded by a £12.6&nbsp;million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund<ref>Heritage Lottery Fund – urltoken Second World War 60 Years On: remembering, learning, commemorating Accessed 10 March 2009.</ref> and provided 5,860m<sup>2</sup> of gallery space and educational facilities over six floors.<ref>Duncan, Sue (29 November 2001) The Architects' Journal urltoken Sensitive choices. Retrieved 14 July 2009</ref> Before the 2013–14 redevelopment, the basement was occupied by permanent galleries on the First and Second World Wars, and of conflicts after 1945. The ground floor comprised the atrium, cinema, temporary exhibition spaces, and visitor facilities. The first floor included the atrium mezzanine, education facilities, and a permanent gallery, Secret War, exploring special forces, espionage and covert operations. The second floor included the atrium viewing balcony, two art galleries, a temporary exhibition area and the permanent Crimes against Humanity exhibition. The third floor housed the permanent Holocaust Exhibition, and the fourth floor, a vaulted roof space, accommodated the Lord Ashcroft Gallery. Opened in November 2010 the gallery exhibits the museum's Victoria Cross (VC) and George Cross collection, alongside the private VC collection amassed by Michael Ashcroft, 241 medals in total.<ref name=arupjournal/><ref>Imperial War Museum (2009) urltoken Imperial War Museum London map Accessed 12 April 2010.</ref><ref></ref>
In August 2019, the Museum announced plans to spend over £30m on a new set of galleries over two floors at its London site covering the Holocaust and its importance in World War II. The galleries are set to open in 2021 and will replace the existing permanent exhibition.<ref></ref>
====All Saints Annexe====
In 1989 the museum acquired the All Saints Annexe, a former hospital building in Austral Street off West Square. The 1867 building, which backs onto Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, was originally an orphanage opened by local philanthropist Charlotte Sharman, then later used as a hospital. It houses the museum's photographic, film and sound archives, and offices.<ref>Archives in London and the M25 Area urltoken All Saints Hospital.

===Imperial War Museum Duxford===
.
Based on the historic Duxford Aerodrome, the site was originally operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the First World War. During the Second World War Duxford played a prominent role during the Battle of Britain and was later used by United States Army Air Forces fighter units in support of the daylight bombing of Germany. Duxford remained an active RAF airfield until 1961. Many of Duxford's original buildings, such as hangars used during the Battle of Britain, are still in use. A number of these buildings are of architectural or historic significance and over thirty have listed building status.<ref name=IWMDhistoric>Imperial War Museum Duxford (2009) urltoken Historic Duxford . Retrieved 15 September 2009.</ref> The site also features a number of purpose-built exhibition buildings, such as the Stirling Prize-winning American Air Museum, designed by Sir Norman Foster. The site remains an active airfield and is used by a number of civilian flying companies, and hosts regular air shows. The site is operated in partnership with Cambridgeshire County Council and the Duxford Aviation Society, a charity formed in 1975 to preserve civil aircraft and promote appreciation of British civil aviation history.

In 2017, the name of the exhibit was changed to "HMS Belfast 1938" to reflect that one of the Royal Navy's new Type 26 frigates had been given the name HMS Belfast.<ref></ref>
===Churchill War Rooms===
The Cabinet War Rooms is an underground complex that served as a British government command centre throughout the Second World War. Located beneath the Treasury building in the Whitehall area of Westminster, the facilities became operational in 1939 and were in constant use until their abandonment in August 1945 after the surrender of Japan. Their historical value was recognised early on, and the public were able to visit by appointment. However, the practicalities of allowing public access to a site beneath a working government office meant that only 4,500 of 30–40,000 annual applicants to visit the War Rooms could be admitted.<ref name=Holmes>Holmes, Richard (2009) Churchill’s Bunker: The Secret Headquarters at the Heart of Britain’s Victory (London: Profile Books Ltd) p. 193 </ref> The museum agreed to take over the administration of the site in 1982,<ref name=Holmes/> a development keenly supported by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an admirer of Britain's wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Thatcher opened the War Rooms in April 1984. In 2003 a further suite of rooms, used as accommodation by Churchill, his wife and close associates, were added to the museum. The restoration of these rooms, which since the war had been stripped out and used for storage, cost £7.5&nbsp;million.<ref>Kennedy, Maev (9 April 2003) The Guardian urltoken Restored underground apartments opened to public. Retrieved 28 July 2009.</ref> In 2005 the War Rooms were rebranded as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms, with 850&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> of the site redeveloped as a biographical museum exploring Churchill's life. The development of the Churchill Museum cost a further £6&nbsp;million. The centrepiece is a 15m interactive table which enables visitors to access digitised material, particularly from the Churchill Archives Centre, via an "electronic filing cabinet".<ref>Waterfield, Giles 'The Churchill Museum: Ministry of sound' Museum Practice No.30 (Summer 2005) pp. 18–21</ref> The museum was renamed the Churchill War Rooms in 2010.
===Imperial War Museum North===
The Imperial War Museum North was opened in Trafford, Greater Manchester, in 2002. It was the first branch of the museum outside southeast England, and the first to be purpose-built as a museum. Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, with Manchester based architects Leach Rhodes Walker providing implementation services,<ref> urltoken The Imperial War Museum North was Libeskind's first building in Britain. Libeskind's building, overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal at Salford Quays, was based on the concept of a globe shattered by conflict into shards and reassembled. These shards, representing earth, air and water, give the building its shape.<ref>Studio Daniel Libeskind urltoken Imperial War Museum North Accessed 16 July 2012</ref> Originally budgeted at £40&nbsp;million, the museum was eventually completed for £28.5&nbsp;million after anticipated funding was not forthcoming. The museum was funded by local, national and European development agencies, by private donations and by Peel Holdings, a local transport and property company which contributed £12.5&nbsp;million.<ref></ref><ref>Glancey, Jonathan (22 April 2002) Guardian Unlimited urltoken War and peace and quiet.

The museum's first floor main gallery space houses the permanent exhibitions. These consist of a chronological display which runs around the gallery's 200m perimeter and six thematic displays in "silos" within the space. The walls of the gallery space are used as screens for the projection of an hourly audiovisual presentation, the Big Picture.

==Collections==
The Imperial War Museum's original collections date back to the material amassed by the National War Museum Committee. The present departmental organisation came into being during the 1960s as part of Frankland's reorganisation of the museum. The 1970s saw oral history gain increasing prominence and in 1972 the museum created the Department of Sound Records (now the Sound Archive) to record interviews with individuals who had experienced the First World War. The museum maintains an urltoken online database of its collections.<ref>For an overview of the museum's collections, see Bardgett, Suzanne 'Imperial War Museum and the history of war' at urltoken 'Making History' maintained by the Institute of Historical Research accessed 17 December 2008</ref>

===Databases===
The IWM has an online database, listing the various items which make up the IWM Collections. In some cases, there are images of the item, or contemporary photos, which can be shared and reused under a Creative Commons Licence.
The War Memorials Register is a database of known war memorials in the United Kingdom. Information material used in composition, the condition of the memorial, its address and coordinates with a satellite map plot are recorded for each of the memorials. There are over 70,000 memorials on the register.<ref></ref> Whilst many memorials are commemorated to those who died in the First World War,<ref></ref> the scope of the project is all conflicts.
In 2014, IWM and online genealogy service provider Findmypast entered into a collaboration to launch the "Lives of the First World War" platform. During the centenary period, anyone could sign up for an account. Those who paid for a subscription had the ability to add records from Findmypast's collections.<ref name="family-tree"></ref>
A number of sources (War Office medal index cards, Canadian Expeditionary Force attestations, Royal Navy service records etc.) had been used as seeding documents to create individual entries in the database. Each person's profile in the database could have been further built up, so as to document when that person was born, when they died, family members etc. If a person needed to be added, or a duplicate existed that needed to be merged, such activity was requested via a support forum manned by IWM volunteers. A user with a subscription had the ability to group person profiles together into a "Community". This could be a grouping based around a ship's crew, a unit in the army, or the names of men and women buried in a given war cemetery.<ref name="LivesKB">
</ref>
The goal had been to encourage crowdsourcing to build up as many details as possible in the database, and to tap into the popularity of online genealogy as a pastime. One selling point of the platform had been that the data captured thus would be used in a "permanent digital memorial<ref></ref> that will be saved for future generations."<ref name="Lives">
</ref> The IWM had declared that the data from the platform will become part of its archive when the platform ceased to be interactive in 2019, "and will be free to access online for research."<ref name="Lives_legacy">

==Governance==
The Imperial War Museum is an executive non-departmental public body under the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, from which it receives financial support in the form of a grant-in-aid. The governance of the museum is the responsibility of a Board of Trustees, originally established by the Imperial War Museum Act 1920,<ref name="iwm1920">Office of Public Sector Information urltoken Revised Statute from The UK Statute Law Database: Imperial War Museum Act 1920 (c.16).

The board comprises a president (currently Prince Edward, Duke of Kent) who is appointed by the sovereign, and fourteen members appointed in varying proportions by the Prime Minister, and the Foreign, Defence, and Culture Secretaries. Seven further members are Commonwealth High Commissioners appointed ex officio by their respective governments. As of January 2012 the Chairman of the Trustees is Sir Francis Richards and his deputy is Lieutenant-General Sir John Kiszely.<ref>Imperial War Museum (2012) urltoken Current Trustees.

During the Second World War Grandy had commanded RAF Duxford, and was chairman during the planning of Duxford's American Air Museum, which opened in 1997.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
The museum's director-general is answerable to the trustees and acts as accounting officer. Since 1917 the museum has had six directors. The first was Sir Martin Conway, a noted art historian, mountaineer and explorer. He was knighted in 1895 for his efforts to map the Karakoram mountain range of the Himalayas, and was Slade Professor of Fine Arts at the University of Cambridge from 1901 to 1904. Conway held the post of director until his death in 1937, when he was succeeded by Leslie Bradley. Bradley had served in the First World War in the Middlesex Regiment before being invalided out in 1917. He later became acquainted with Charles ffoulkes, who invited him to join the museum where he was initially engaged in assembling the museum's poster collection.<ref>'Mr L. R. Bradley: Former Director of Imperial War Museum' (obituary) The Times 30 January 1968 p. 8</ref> Bradley retired in 1960 and was succeeded by Dr Noble Frankland. Frankland had served as a navigator in RAF Bomber Command, winning a Distinguished Flying Cross. While a Cabinet Office official historian he co-authored a controversial official history of the RAF strategic air campaign against Germany. Frankland retired in 1982 and was succeeded by Dr Alan Borg who had previously been at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts. In 1995 Borg moved to the Victoria and Albert Museum and was succeeded by Sir Robert Crawford, who had originally been recruited by Frankland as a research assistant in 1968. Upon Crawford's retirement in 2008 he was succeeded by Diane Lees, previously director of the V&A Museum of Childhood. She was noted in the media as the first woman appointed to lead a British national museum.<ref>Heal, Sharon (January 2008) 'New chief at IWM revealed' Museums Journal 108/1 p. 8</ref>

A second phase took a wider 20th century historical remit; it comprised a learning programme using overseas visits and social media, and a professional development scheme for educators.<ref></ref> A digital archive of the project,<ref></ref> online exhibitions and learning resources were also produced.<ref></ref>
In October 2011 the museum brand itself as Imperial War Museums, the initials IWM forming the basis of a new corporate logo.<ref></ref>
In September 2011 the museum secured funding from NESTA, the Arts and Humanities Research Council and Arts Council England to develop "social interpretation" systems to allow visitors to comment on, collect, and share museum objects via social media.<ref name=NESTA></ref> These systems were incorporated in "A Family in Wartime", an exhibition at IWM London depicting British family life during the Second World War, which opened in April 2012.<ref name=socintguardian></ref>
