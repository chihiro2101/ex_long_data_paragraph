== History of the term ==
===Michael "Mickey" Finn===
The Mickey Finn is most likely named after the manager and bartender of the Lone Star Saloon and Palm Garden Restaurant, which operated in Chicago from 1896 to 1903, on South State Street in the Chicago Loop neighborhood.<ref></ref><ref name="location">The saloon's exact location is usually said to be on the west side of South State Street, just north of Congress Parkway. The entire west side of South State Street between Congress and Van Buren is now occupied by Chicago Public Library's Central Library (also known as the Harold Washington Library at 400 South State Street). The December 16–17, 1903 Chicago Tribune articles give the address as 527 State Street (corner of State and Harmon Court), however, which is now the 1100 block of South State Street. The 500 block of South State Street now is between Congress Street and Harrison Street, which may be the reason for the confusion of the saloon's location. Refer to "New map of Chicago showing street car lines in colors and street numbers in even hundreds" (Chicago: Rufus Blanchard, 1897) for the 1903 Chicago street names and numbering.</ref><ref name="whiskeyrow">The area on State Street centered between Van Buren Street (to the north) to Harrison Street (to the south) was known as "Whiskey Row" from the late 1880s to the early 1910s. Just south of Harrison Street was a block known as "Hell's Half Mile". The area of State Street south of Harrison was also known as "Satan's Mile".</ref> In December 1903, several Chicago newspapers document that a Michael "Mickey" Finn managed the Lone Star Saloon and was accused of using knockout drops to incapacitate and rob some of his customers.<ref name="tribune_dec16">. Quoting from the article, "Michael Finn, owner of saloon at corner of State Street and Harmon Court now East 11 Street . Two former habitués—Mrs. Mary Thornton and Isabelle Fyffe—told that he gave 'knock-out drops' to customers suspected of having money and afterwards robbed them." Mary Thornton is quoted, "I worked for Finn a year and a half and in that time I saw a dozen men given 'dope' by Finn and his bartender. The work was done in two little rooms adjoining the palm garden in back of the saloon".</ref><ref name="tribune_dec17">. Quoting from the article, "Lone Star Saloon, 527 State Street now 1100 block of South State Street, managed by Micky Finn, closed by order of Mayor Harrison."</ref><ref name="daily news_dec16">.</ref><ref name="interocean_dec17">. The Inter-Ocean was another Chicago newspaper in 1903.</ref> Moreover, the first known written example of the term, according to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), is in 1915, which was 12 years after his trial and lends credence to this theory.
The first popular account of Mickey Finn was given by Herbert Asbury in his 1940 book Gem of the Prairie: An Informal History of the Chicago Underworld. His cited sources are Chicago newspapers and the 1903 court testimony of Lone Star prostitute "Gold Tooth" Mary Thornton. Before his days as a saloon proprietor, Mickey Finn was known as a pickpocket and thief who often preyed on drunken bar patrons. The act of serving a Mickey Finn Special was a coordinated robbery orchestrated by Finn. First, Finn or one of his employees (including "house girls") would slip chloral hydrate into the unsuspecting patron's drink.<ref></ref> The incapacitated patron would be escorted or carried into a back room by one of Finn's associates, who would then rob him and dump him in an alley. The victim would wake up the next morning in a nearby alley and would remember little or nothing of what had happened. 
Finn's saloon was ordered to be closed on December 16, 1903. He was apparently arrested again in 1918, this time for running an illegal bar in South Chicago.<ref name="tribune_1918jul8">. "Mickey Finn was arrested last night and lodged in the South Chicago police station. Mickey also known as Mike runs a hut at 115th Street and the Calumet River. He and his housekeeper Millie Schober and twenty customers were swooped down on by the police and all taken to the station. A wagon load of beer and booze was confiscated. Mickey and the woman were charged with running a disorderly house and selling liquor without formal authorization."</ref>
===Chicago restaurant poisonings===
On June 22, 1918, four people were arrested and over one hundred waiters taken into custody over the apparent widespread practice of poisoning by waiters in Chicago. Guests who tipped poorly were given "Mickey Finn powder" in their food or drinks.<ref name="KCStar_1918june23"> "Evidence against the waiters was obtained by a detective agency employed by the Hotel Sherman after several guests had become ill suspiciously.Large quantities were found in a drawer behind the bar at the waiters' union headquarters.</ref><ref name="Duluth_1918june24"></ref><ref name="Tribune_1918june23"></ref><ref name="Tribune_1918june24"></ref><ref name="Tribune_1918june25"></ref><ref name="Tribune_1918july8"></ref><ref name="Tribune_1918aug7"></ref> Chemical analysis showed that it contained antimony potassium tartrate,<ref name="Tribune_1918june23"/> also called "emetic tartar"; which in addition to causing vomiting, headaches, dizziness and depression, can be lethal in large quantities. Two bartenders were arrested for selling the powder at the bar at the waiters' union headquarters, and W.&nbsp;Stuart Wood and his wife were arrested for manufacturing the powder. Wood sold packets of it for 20 cents<ref name="Tribune_1918jul9">.</ref> and referred to it as "Mickey Finn Powder" in a letter to union bartender John Millian.<ref name="Tribune_1918jul11">. "Friend Johnny: Am enclosing two dozen packets of the Mickey Finn Powder.also find enclosed a couple hundred circulars.These circulars are not for use in Chicago.Whenever you have a man that is leaving Chicago talk Mickey Finn to him and give him a few of these circulars.</ref> A follow-up article mentions the pursuit of a man named Jean Crones, who was believed to be responsible for poisoning over 100 people at a Chicago University Club banquet at which three people died.<ref name="idaho_1918june26">.</ref><ref name="KCStar_1918june26">.</ref>
