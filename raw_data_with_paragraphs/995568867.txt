Miami Fusion

==History==
===Early history===
Major League Soccer announced a South Florida team in 1997 as one of its first two expansions, along with the Chicago Fire.<ref></ref> Miami businessman Ken Horowitz served as owner, the first new investor to join Major League Soccer since its founding in 1995.<ref name=Dure64></ref> The team, ultimately named the Miami Fusion, debuted in the 1998 MLS season, playing in Lockhart Stadium, the league's first soccer-specific stadium.<ref></ref><ref name=Rusnak>Rusnak, Jeff (October 8, 2012). urltoken "Fusion's Lockhart Stadium stint paved way for new MLS venues". Sun-Sentinel. Retrieved March 13, 2014.</ref>
The Fusion started their inaugural season strong. Led by star midfielder Carlos Valderrama, the Fusion drew 20,450 to their first game at Lockhart Stadium against D.C. United, showing off the possibilities of a more intimate venue designed especially for soccer.<ref></ref> Another 3,000 were turned away by police.<ref></ref> However, interest waned through the year along with the team's middling performance on the field. The Fusion replaced head coach Carlos "Cacho" Cordoba with Ivo Wortmann after game 19, and the team managed a playoff spot, losing to D.C. By the end of the year their average attendance had dropped to 10,284.<ref name=Dure64/>
The Fusion continued to struggle both on and off the field for the next two years. After years of disagreement, the commissioner "reassigned" Carlos Valderrama back to Tampa Bay in 1999, and the team replaced head coach Ivo Wortmann with Ray Hudson mid-season in 2000.<ref></ref> The team made a dramatic improvement in the 2001 season, winning the Supporters' Shield with the best regular season performance, taking the Eastern Conference, and advancing to the league semifinals.<ref></ref> Attendance improved as well, but remained fourth worst in the league with an average of 11,177. In the front office, owner Ken Horowitz struggled with finances. He, along with Robert Kraft of the New England Revolution and Stuart Subotnick of the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, formed a faction among MLS owners who wanted to keep spending down, as opposed to Lamar Hunt and Philip Anschutz who wished to invest in long-term development. Despite the team's improvements, by the end of the 2001 season they had the league's lowest season ticket sales and the lowest revenues from sponsors.<ref></ref>
===Demise===
Major League Soccer had reportedly lost an estimated $250 million during its first five years.<ref name=profit></ref><ref name="nytimes">New York Times, For M.L.S., the Sport's Future Is in the Eye of the Beholder, November 11, 2005, urltoken 
The league's poor financial condition forced MLS to stop the bleeding. During the winter break between the 2000 and 2001 seasons, reports began circulating that MLS was considering trimming the league from 12 teams back to 10 teams.<ref name="espn.go.com">ESPN.com Soccernet, MLS considering weight-loss program, urltoken Rumors began circulating that the league might pull the plug on the Fusion, even though the Fusion had a low-cost stadium lease, and an improved performance in 2001 with increased fan attendance.<ref>Sun Sentinel, Fusion Owner Looking For Way Out, December 15, 2001, urltoken 
MLS announced in January 2002 that it had decided to contract the two Florida franchises, the Fusion and the Tampa Bay Mutiny.<ref></ref> Both teams were withdrawn from the league, ceased operations and folded. Major League Soccer's contraction reduced the league from 12 to 10 teams. The league had chosen to fold the Miami Fusion, in part because the Fusion's ownership reportedly lacked financial resources, had been trying to run the Fusion on a bare-minimum budget, and had asked the league to pay some of the club's expenses.<ref name="espn.go.com"/> Commissioner Garber stated that the Fusion had the lowest revenue in the league, due to fewer season tickets and almost no revenue from corporate sponsorships.<ref name="sportsillustrated.cnn.com">Sports Illustrated, Garber, Horowitz discuss MLS contraction, January 9, 2002, urltoken

Additionally, the MLS season is in the summer, which is different from the youth soccer season, making it difficult to draw youth soccer teams to attend Fusion matches. There were also issues with local summertime heat and rain. Finally, Horowitz identified a lack of corporate support for the team.
On April 2, 2015, a new club with the name Miami Fusion FC joined the fourth-tier National Premier Soccer League.<ref></ref>
The club dissolved in 2018.
MLS returned to the South Florida area in 2018, when Inter Miami CF was announced. On January 29, 2018, the Miami Beckham United group, four years after the ownership's original announcement of pursuing a team, was awarded the twenty-fifth MLS franchise and was set to launch in the 2020 season.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

The Fusion played their home games at Fort Lauderdale's Lockhart Stadium. They had originally intended to play at the Orange Bowl Stadium in downtown Miami, but could not reach an agreement with the city of Miami, as the city wanted a 10-year lease and a prohibition on the team relocating to another South Florida stadium.<ref></ref><ref name="articles.sun-sentinel.com"></ref> Subsequently, the Fusion reached an agreement with the Broward County School Board and the city of Fort Lauderdale to use Lockhart Stadium.<ref name="articles.sun-sentinel.com"/><ref></ref>
Originally constructed as a high school football and track stadium in 1959, Lockhart had hosted the Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the original North American Soccer League from 1977 to 1983, as well as other soccer games.<ref name=Thuma11></ref> Fusion owner Ken Horowitz spearheaded a $5 million renovation that converted Lockhart into a 20,000-seat soccer-specific stadium.<ref name=Rusnak/><ref name=Thuma11/> The new stadium was the first of its kind in Major League Soccer; at the time all other teams played in much larger football stadiums. This innovation set a trend for similar facilities throughout the league that continues today.<ref name=Rusnak/>
The stadium site was redeveloped in 2019 and 2020 with the construction of Inter Miami CF Stadium for Major League Soccer club Inter Miami CF.<ref name="demo begins"></ref>

The Miami Fusion was a professional soccer team based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. They played in Major League Soccer (MLS) for four seasons, from 1998 to 2001.

The Fusion played their home games at Lockhart Stadium.
