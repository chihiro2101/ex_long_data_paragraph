Joseph (Genesis)

==Jewish tradition==
===Selling Joseph===
In the midrash, the selling of Joseph was part of God's divine plan for him to save his tribes. The favoritism Israel showed Joseph and the plot against him by his brothers were divine means of getting him into Egypt.<ref>Scharfstein, S. Torah and Commentary: The Five Books of Moses , , 2008, p.124</ref> Maimonides comments that even the villager in Shechem, about whom Joseph inquired his brother's whereabouts, was a "divine messenger" working behind the scene.<ref>Scharfstein, 2008, p. 120</ref>
A midrash asked, How many times was Joseph sold? In analyzing , there are five different Hebrew names used to describe five different groups of people involved in the transaction of selling Joseph, according to Rabbi Judah and Rav Huna. The first group identified, are Joseph's brothers when Judah brings up the idea of selling Joseph in verses 26 and 27. The first mention of Ishmaelites (Yishma'elîm) is in verse 25. Then the Hebrew phrase ŉāshîm midyanîm sōĥrîm in verse 28 describes Midianite traders. A fourth group in verse 36 is named in Hebrew as m‘danîm that is properly identified as Medanites. The final group, where a transaction is made, is among the Egyptians in the same verse.
After identifying the Hebrew names, Rabbi Judah claims that Joseph was sold four times: First his brothers sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites (Yishma'elîm), then the Ishmaelites sold him to the Midianite traders (ŉāshîm midyanîm sōĥrîm), the Midianite traders to the Medanites (m‘danîm), and the Medanites into Egypt. Rav Huna adds one more sale by concluding that after the Medanites sold him to the Egyptians, a fifth sale occurred when the Egyptians sold him to Potiphar. (Genesis Rabbah 84:22)
===Potiphar’s wife===
Joseph had good reasons not to have an affair with Potiphar's wife: he did not want to abuse his master's trust; he believed in the sanctity of marriage; and it went against his ethical, moral and religious principles taught to him by his father Jacob. According to the Midrash, Joseph would have been immediately executed by the sexual assault charge against him by Potiphar's wife. Abravanel explains that she had accused other servants of the same crime in the past. Potiphar believed that Joseph was incapable of such an act and petitioned Pharaoh to spare his life.<ref>Scharfstein, 2008, pp. 125–26</ref> However, punishment could not have been avoided because of her class status and limited public knowledge of her scheme.
According to Legend of the Jews, the name of Potiphar's wife is Zuleikha and when she was enticing Joseph to give up to her sinful passion, God appeared unto him, holding the foundation of earth (Eben Shetiyah), that He would destroy the world If Joseph touched her.<ref></ref>
===Silver cup for divination===
Jewish tradition holds that Joseph had his steward plant his personal silver cup in Benjamin's sack to test his brothers. He wanted to know if they would be willing to risk danger in order to save their half brother Benjamin. Since Joseph and Benjamin were born from Rachel, this test was necessary to reveal if they would betray Benjamin as they did with Joseph when he was seventeen. Because Joseph the Dreamer predicts the future by analyzing dreams, alternative Jewish tradition claims that he practiced divination using this silver cup as the steward charged<ref></ref> and as Joseph himself claimed in .<ref>Scharfstein, 2008, pp. 138–39</ref>
===Raising Joseph===
In one Talmudic story, Joseph was buried in the Nile river, as there was some dispute as to which province should be honored by having his tomb within its boundaries. Moses, led there by an ancient holy woman named Serach, was able by a miracle to raise the sarcophagus and to take it with him at the time of the Exodus.
== Christian tradition ==
Joseph is mentioned in the New Testament as an example of faith . Joseph is commemorated as one of the Holy Forefathers in the Calendar of Saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on 26 July. In the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, he is known as "Joseph the all-comely", a reference not only to his physical appearance, but more importantly to the beauty of his spiritual life. They commemorate him on the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers (two Sundays before Christmas) and on Holy and Great Monday (Monday of Holy Week). In icons, he is sometimes depicted wearing the nemes headdress of an Egyptian vizier. The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod commemorates him as a patriarch on 31 March.
=== Typological interpretation ===
In addition to honoring him, there was a strong tendency in the patristic period to view his life as a typological precursor to Christ.<ref></ref> This tendency is represented in John Chrysostom who said that Joseph's suffering was "a type of things to come",<ref></ref> Caesarius of Arles who interpreted Joseph's famous coat as representative of the diverse nations who would follow Christ,<ref></ref> Ambrose of Milan who interpreted the standing sheaf as prefiguring the resurrection of Christ,<ref></ref> and others.
This tendency, although greatly diminished, was followed throughout late antiquity, the Medieval Era, and into the Reformation. Even John Calvin, sometimes hailed as the father of modern grammatico-historical exegesis,<ref></ref> writes "in the person of Joseph, a lively image of Christ is presented."<ref></ref>
In addition, some Christian authors have argued that this typological interpretation finds its origin in the speech of Stephen in Acts , as well as the Gospel of Luke and the parables of Jesus, noting strong verbal and conceptual collocation between the Greek translation of the portion of Genesis concerning Joseph and the Parable of the Wicked Tenants and the Parable of the Prodigal Son.<ref></ref>
==Islamic tradition==
Joseph , is regarded by Muslims as a prophet (Quran, suras vi. 84, xl. 34), and a whole chapter Yusuf (sura xii.) is devoted to him, the only instance in the Quran in which an entire chapter is devoted to a complete story of a prophet. It is described as the 'best of stories'.<ref></ref> Joseph is said to have been extremely handsome, which attracted his Egyptian master's wife to attempt to seduce him. Muhammad is believed to have once said, "One half of all the beauty God apportioned for mankind went to Joseph and his mother; the other one half went to the rest of mankind."<ref></ref> The story has a lot in common with the biblical narrative, but with certain differences.<ref></ref> In the Quran the brothers ask Jacob ("Yaqub") to let Joseph go with them.<ref></ref> Joseph is thrown into a well, and was taken as a slave by a passing caravan. When the brothers revealed to the father that a wolf had eaten Joseph, he observed patience.<ref></ref>
In the Bible, Joseph discloses himself to his brethren before they return to their father the second time after buying grain.<ref name="dt"> urltoken Differences of Tradition</ref> But in Islam they returned leaving behind Benjamin because the mizzen bowl of the king was found in his bag.<ref></ref> Similarly, the eldest son of Jacob had decided not to leave the land because of the oath taken to protect Benjamin beforehand.<ref></ref> When Jacob learned their story after their return, he wept in grief till he lost his eyesight because of sorrow.<ref></ref> He thus charged his sons to go and inquire about Joseph and his brother and despair not of God's mercy. It was during this return to Egypt that Joseph disclosed his real identity to his brothers. He admonished and forgave them, he sent also his garment which healed the patriarch's eyes as soon as it was casted unto his face.<ref></ref> The remaining verses describe the migration of jacob's family to Egypt and the emotional meeting of Jacob and his long lost son, Joseph. The family prostrated before him hence the fulfilment of his dream aforetime.<ref></ref>
The story concludes by Joseph praying " my lord you have indeed bestowed upon me of the sovereignty and taught me something of the interpretation of dreams- the (only) creator of heavens and the earth! you are my Guardian in this world and in the Hereafter. Cause me to die as a Muslim and join me with the righteous " (Qur'an 12:101).
==Baha'i tradition==
There are numerous mentions of Joseph in Bahá'í writings. These come in the forms of allusions written by the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh. In the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá'u'lláh states that "from my laws, the sweet-smelling savour of my garment can be smelled" and, in the Four Valleys, states that "the fragrance of his garment blowing from the Egypt of Baha," referring to Joseph.
Bahá'í commentaries have described these as metaphors with the garment implying the recognition of a manifestation of God. In the Qayyumu'l-Asma', the Báb refers to Bahá'u'lláh as the true Joseph and makes an analogous prophecy regarding Bahá'u'lláh suffering at the hands of his brother, Mírzá Yahyá.<ref></ref>

The historicity of the Joseph narrative cannot be demonstrated. According to researches on the historicity of the Old Testament, the descent of Abraham into Egypt as recorded in Genesis 12:10-20 should correspond to the early years of the 2nd millennium BCE, which is before the time the Hyksos ruled in Egypt, but would coincide with the Semitic parties known to have visited the Egyptians circa 1900 BCE, as documented in the painting of a West-Asiatic procession of the tomb of Khnumhotep II at Beni Hasan.<ref name="ZIBD"></ref> It might be possible to associate Abraham to such known Semitic visitors to Egypt, as they would have been ethnically connected.<ref name="ZIBD"/><ref name="JPI"></ref> The period of Joseph and Jacob in Egypt (Genesis 39:50), where they were in favour at the Egyptian court and Joseph held high administrative positions next to the ruler of the land, would correspond to the time the Hyksos ruled in Egypt, during the Fifteenth Dynasty.<ref name="ZIBD"/> The time of Moses and the migration to Canaan related in The Exodus could also correspond to the expulsion of the Hyksos from Egypt.<ref name="ZIBD"/><ref name="JPI"/>
Hermann Gunkel, Hugo Gressmann and Gerhard von Rad identified the story of Joseph as a literary composition, in the genre of romance, or the novella. As a novella, it is read as reworking legends and myths, in particular the motifs of his reburial in Canaan, associated with the Egyptian god Osiris. Others compare the burial of his bones at Shechem, with the disposal of Dionysus's bones at Delphi. For Schenke, the tradition of Joseph's burial at Shechem is understood as a secondary, Israelitic historical interpretation woven around a more ancient Canaanite shrine in that area. The reworked legends and folklore were probably inserted into the developing textual tradition of the Bible between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE. Most scholars place its composition in a genre that flourished in the Persian period of the Exile.
