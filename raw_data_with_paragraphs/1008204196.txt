Murder of Gwen Araujo

===Killing===
When Nabors and Cazares returned, Araujo was still conscious, bleeding from her head wound and sitting on the couch.<ref name="brutal slaying"/> José Merél became concerned that Araujo was bleeding on the couch and ordered her off it.<ref name=SFC-030226 /> At some point, the assault resumed. Nabors and Cazares urged the others to "knock the b— out", according to Nabors's testimony.<ref name=SFC-030226></ref> Magidson hit her head against the living room wall with his knee, rendering her unconscious.<ref name="brutal slaying"/><ref name="Trial begins"></ref> Nabors testified that Magidson's assault was so severe it left a dent in the wall and cracked the plaster.<ref name=SFC-030226 /> Cazares kicked her.<ref name="Trial begins"/> Merél was concerned with cleaning Araujo's blood off the couch<ref name=SFC-030226 /> and carpet before retreating to his room so the others would not see him crying.<ref name=SFC-050727 />
After Araujo was knocked unconscious, Magidson bound her wrists and ankles, then she was wrapped in a comforter to minimize the amount of blood staining the carpet, before being carried to the garage of the home.<ref name=SFC-030226 /> After this, the defendants' testimonies diverge.
Nabors testified that Magidson strangled her with a rope and that Jason Cazares struck her with a shovel,<ref name="Case of slain" /> but Nabors was returning from the garage and did not actually witness the act of strangulation. Referring to Araujo as Lida – the name she had used with them – Nabors testified that he saw Magidson raising the rope to her neck before he left the garage and that Magidson later told the others "that he had wrapped the rope around Lida's neck and twisted it." According to Nabors, Magidson "wasn't sure if Lida had died from twisting the rope, but once Jason hit her twice with the shovel, he knew she was dead".<ref name="SFC-030226" />
Magidson testified that it was instead Nabors who strangled her and struck her with the shovel,<ref name="SFC-050816"></ref> and Cazares testified that he never struck her and did not see her die.<ref name="Case of slain" /> José Merél testified he was cleaning Araujo's blood out of the carpets and couch as Magidson was binding her ankles, prior to her being taken to the garage.<ref name="SFC-050727" /> Merél also said he thought she was still alive until he saw her body in the bed of Magidson's truck.<ref name="SFC-050727" /> It is not clear at what point during this sequence of events she died. However, the autopsy showed that she died from strangulation associated with blunt force trauma to the head.<ref name="sfgate_lida" /><ref name="deception and betrayal" /> According to Merél, Magidson said he was not sure she was dead until they struck her with a shovel.<ref name="SFC-050727" />
She was then placed in the bed of a pick-up truck, and the four men drove her body four hours away, burying her near the Sierra Nevada mountains in a shallow grave in the El Dorado National Forest near Silver Fork Road in El Dorado County. On their way home, they purchased breakfast at a McDonald's drive-through window.<ref name="SFC-030226" /> Later that morning, during a phone conversation, Brown asked José Merél what happened, to which he replied "Let's just say she had a long walk home."<ref name="SFC-030220" />
==Arrests==
The party-goers did not report the crime and the assailants said nothing to anyone about the murder. Araujo usually checked in with her mother, so when she did not come home the day after the party, her mother called the police on October 5 to report her missing.<ref name="sfgate_lida"/> Police did not initially take the missing persons case seriously partly because she was transgender,<ref name=Emporia-09 /> and she was known to stay away from home overnight.<ref name="LAT-021020"></ref> Rumors reached her family that a girl who had been outed as transgender at a party had been killed and buried in Tahoe,<ref name=LAT-021020 /> and her aunt called the police on October 9 to pass on the story. Police began to interview the party-goers, and one of them led the police to the Meréls' house.<ref name=LAT-021019></ref>
Two days after Araujo was reported missing, a friend of Jaron Nabors described him as appearing distraught.<ref name="sfgate_lida"/> Nabors had confessed to a friend what the four had done shortly after returning from the grave site. That friend tipped off the police, and agreed to wear a microphone during a subsequent conversation with Nabors about the murder.<ref name=LAT-040623 /> Confronted with the recording, Nabors agreed to lead authorities to the body<ref name=SFC-030226 /> on October 15.<ref name="sfgate_lida"/>
The Alameda County Sheriff's Office dispatched four crime scene investigators and two detectives to recover Araujo's body from the grave site. The four who were initially arrested and accused of the murder were Magidson (age 22); Nabors (19), José Merél (22), and Paul Merél.<ref name=sfgate_lida />
Paul Merél was released after Brown and Emmanuel Merél told the police that he had left the scene with them.<ref name=SFC-040423 /> Magidson, Nabors, and José Merél were charged with murder on October 17 and held without bail.<ref></ref> On October 24, Nabors pleaded not guilty, Magidson was still looking for an attorney, and José Merél was still reviewing the evidence against him. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Merél was confident that charges would be dropped.<ref name=LAT-021025></ref>
After he was arrested, Nabors wrote a letter to a girlfriend in which he stated the defendants had discussed a "The Sopranos plan" to "kill the b— and get rid of her body". The letter was intercepted by sheriff's officials<ref name=SFC-030225 /> and led to the arrest of Cazares on November 19.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Cazares had been identified as a potential witness on October 22.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> At the first trial, defense attorney Tony Serra accused Nabors of writing the letter knowing it would be intercepted and implicate Cazares.<ref name=SFC-040428 />
== Trials ==
===Jaron Nabors===
Nabors pleaded guilty on February 24, 2003, to a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter, which carried an 11-year prison sentence, along with a promise to testify against the other three defendants.<ref>Dennis, Rob. " urltoken Tape played of witness, girlfriend," Oakland Tribune, 15 June 2005. Retrieved on 18 November 2008.</ref><ref name=SFC-031003></ref><ref>Gwen Araujo Memorial Transgender Education Fund. " urltoken Relationship Risks! "</ref> During the formal entry of his plea, Judge Kenneth Burr warned Nabors that he could still be charged with murder if prosecutors found he wasn't "living up to your end of the bargain."<ref name=SFC-030225></ref>
During the February 2003 indictment proceedings, Nabors gave a detailed account of the murder and burial. As they were burying her, the men continued to disparage her. Nabors testified that he stated he "couldn't believe that someone would ever do that, would be that deceitful" and that José Merél added "he was so mad he could still kick her a couple more times".<ref name=SFC-030226 />
Nabors received an 11-year sentence on August 25, 2006. With credit for time served, he was expected to spend approximately five years in jail from that point forward.<ref name=SFC-060826></ref>
===Magidson, Merél, and Cazares===
====First trial====
Before the first trial, the prosecuting attorney, Alameda County deputy district attorney Chris Lamiero argued that simply being transgender should not have been a death sentence:<ref></ref><blockquote>One can debate the propriety of one choosing to identify with a gender other than the one they were born with. But I trust juries to understand that people don't get to make life or death decisions simply based on someone's lifestyle. That's not a world in which I want to live or most people want to live in.</blockquote>Jury selection for the trial of Magidson, José Merél, and Cazares began on March 15, 2004. Prospective jurors were asked if they knew any lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender people; whether they knew any recently married same-sex couples; whether they had met any transgender people; or whether they had seen a "movie or theatrical performance depicting the activities of a transgender person". One of the defense attorneys explained the last question had specifically asked if prospective jurors had watched the film Boys Don't Cry or the play The Laramie Project, but was changed over defense concerns that by being so specific, those who had not would be prompted to watch them.<ref name="lida2" />
The first trial began on April 14, 2004. Prosecuting attorney Lamiero used male pronouns and her birth name to refer to Araujo, saying the defendants had decided "that the wages of Gwen Araujo's sin of deception were death."<ref></ref> In his opening statement, the defense attorney for Magidson argued that he should not be charged with murder, rather manslaughter at worst, under California law.<ref> </ref> Magidson's attorney said that his client was not biased<ref></ref> but had been shocked "beyond reason" to learn he had unwittingly had sex with a "man": a variant of the gay panic defense.<ref></ref> During his testimony, Nabors said he felt his friends had been raped, since Araujo (whom he referred to as male) "did not come clean with being what he really was. I feel like he forced them into homosexual sex, and my definition of rape was being forced into sex." When asked how she forced them, Nabors answered, "Through deception."<ref name="SFC-040428"></ref>
The first trial ended in a mistrial on June 22 following nine days of deliberations, when the jurors were unable to reach a unanimous decision for the three men.<ref name="LAT-040623" /><ref></ref> While the jury agreed that Araujo had been murdered, they could not agree whether it was premeditated.<ref name="SFC-060826" /> The final votes were 10–2 in favor of acquitting Merél and Cazares of first-degree murder, and 7–5 in favor of convicting Magidson of first-degree murder. Although they were given the option of convicting the men of second-degree murder or manslaughter, they were unable to proceed past the first-degree murder deliberations.<ref name="LAT-040623"></ref>
One of the jurors wrote a newspaper article after the mistrial; in it, he credited Cazares's defense attorney, Tony Serra, with introducing enough reasonable doubt about the veracity of the prosecution's witnesses, including both Brown (who had admitted to consuming more than a dozen beers that night) and Nabors (who was characterized as a liar and "chameleon", prone to exaggeration and eager to please in every social situation).<ref></ref>
====Second trial====
The second trial began on May 31, 2005. Publicity by transgender activists was credited with informing the public about the tactics the defense lawyers had adopted to blame Araujo for her own death, changing the approach to the case. The day after the first trial ended in a mistrial, a court granted Araujo's mother's petition for a posthumous name change, requiring the defense lawyers to refer to the victim with female pronouns.<ref></ref> Magidson, Merél, and Cazares were charged with first-degree murder with hate-crime enhancements.<ref name=SFC-050826 />
The three defendants testified in this trial – and blamed each other as well as Nabors. Nabors, testifying for the prosecution, stated that Magidson admitted to strangling Araujo. Merel testified that Nabors was responsible for the major head injuries to Araujo, but supported the assertion that Magidson had strangled her. Magidson testified that Nabors admitted he had strangled Araujo. During Magidson's testimony, a tape of his initial interview with the police was shown, in which an investigator was recorded coaching him to use the trans panic defense: "You'd be surprised. Moms – especially moms – if they knew the facts – you'd be surprised."<ref></ref>
During the closing statements of the second trial, Cazares' defense lawyer Tony Serra argued that the three defendants were "ordinary human beings" who were guilty, at most, of manslaughter for their role in the death in a "classic state of heat and passion".<ref name=SFC-050826></ref> Serra also argued that Cazares took no active role in killing her.<ref name=SFC-050826 /> To avoid a second mistrial, prosecuting attorney Chris Lamiero argued for a first-degree murder conviction, but gave jurors the option of a second-degree murder conviction for the three, or even manslaughter for Merél.<ref name=SFC-050826 /> He asked the jury to return first-degree murder convictions of Magidson and Cazares, fingering Magidson as the main culprit who had strangled Araujo and calling him "a poor excuse for a man" with a "stupid and moronic" list of excuses for murdering her.<ref></ref>
On September 8, the jury announced that it had reached verdicts on two of the three defendants. As Judge Harry Sheppard instructed, the verdicts were kept secret.<ref></ref>
On September 12, after a week of deliberation, the jury announced its verdicts. It had deadlocked on Cazares, voting 9–3 in favor of convicting him for murder. Magidson and Merél were each convicted on the charge of second-degree murder,<ref></ref> but not convicted of the hate-crime enhancement allegations.<ref name=SFC-050914></ref> After the trial, one of the jurors stated in an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle that the murder conviction was because "The community standard is not and cannot be that killing is something a reasonable person would have done that night" but not hate crimes since the murder was believed to have been committed not because Araujo was transgender, but to "cover up a situation that had gotten out of control."<ref name=SFC-050914 />
Lamiero had undermined criminal intent by commenting, "Gwen being transgender was not a provocative act. It's who she was. However, I would not further ignore the reality that Gwen made some decisions in her relation with these defendants that were impossible to defend," he added. "I don't think most jurors are going to think it's OK to engage someone in sexual activity knowing they assume you have one sexual anatomy when you don't."<ref></ref>
Michael Magidson and José Merél were sentenced in January to 15 years to life in prison, for second-degree murder. While Merél expressed deep sorrow and regret to Araujo's family, Magidson was angry about his verdict and expressed "no remorse" for his role in murdering Araujo, according to presiding Judge Harry Sheppard.<ref name=eBAR-060201></ref>
====Jason Cazares====
To avoid a third trial, Cazares pleaded no contest to manslaughter on December 16, 2005,<ref name="SFC-051217" /> and was sentenced to six years in prison,<ref name="SJMN-161014" /> with credit for time already served.<ref></ref> Attorney Gloria Allred represented Araujo's family.<ref></ref> Cazares asked to begin serving his sentence after the birth of his third child, scheduled for March or April 2006, which was granted,<ref name=eBAR-060201/> although Lamiero noted "it's difficult for me to entertain a request like that when Gwen Araujo is dead."<ref name="SFC-051217"></ref> According to Lamiero, Cazares was willing to plead guilty to being an accessory after the fact, but that deal was rejected because the sentence was just three years and admitted no culpability in the murder.<ref name="SFC-051217" />
==Aftermath==
Gwen Araujo was mourned in a public funeral at St. Edwards Catholic Church in Newark on October 25, 2002. Fred Phelps and the members of Phelps's Westboro Baptist Church promised to picket the funeral,<ref name=LAT-021025 /> but did not.<ref></ref> She was cremated, and her mother Sylvia Guerrero retained the urn with her ashes.<ref name=SFC-031003 />
TransVision, a comprehensive health and social services program for transgender people in Alameda County, was founded in 2002 and operated by Tri-City Health Center after the murder of Gwen Araujo.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
At the request of Guerrero, a judge posthumously name change to Gwen Amber Rose Araujo on June 23, 2004.<ref name="namechange"></ref> Amber Rose was the name Guerrero had chosen before her child was born, in the event it was a girl.<ref name=Emporia-09 />
On the first anniversary of the murder, Horizons Foundation created the Gwen Araujo Memorial Fund for Transgender Education. The Fund's purpose was to support school-based programs in the nine-county Bay Area that promote understanding of transgender people and issues through annual grants. Through this fund, Sylvia Guerrero and her family spoke in middle and high schools about transgender awareness and understanding.<ref name="gwenfund"></ref> By 2005, Guerrero had spoken to more than 20 schools.<ref name="SFC-050913"></ref> The fund was closed sometime before September 2020.<ref> urltoken 
Sylvia Guerrero, Araujo's mother, used to make good money as a legal assistant at a San Jose law firm but was homeless due to PTSD from the incident. Guerrero has been unable to return to work and now shuffles her belongings from relative's houses using a borrowed car from her friend.<ref></ref>
