St. John's University (New York City)

==History==
===Foundations===
St. John's University was founded in 1870, by the Vincentian Fathers of the Catholicism in response to an invitation by the first Bishop of Brooklyn, John Loughlin, to provide the underprivileged youth of the city with an intellectual and moral education. Originally established as the College of St. John the Baptist, the first campus was located at 75 Lewis Avenue, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. Ground was broken for St. John's College Hall, the university's first building, on May 28, 1868. The cornerstone was laid on July 25, 1869.<ref>"Laying the Corner Stone of the College of St. John the Baptist". The New York Times. July 26, 1869. p. 8.</ref> and opened for educational purposes on September 5, 1870.<ref>Stiles, Henry R. History of Kings County. Vol. 2. p. 955.</ref>
===Founding principles===
St. John's Vincentian values stem from the ideals and works of St Vincent de Paul (1581–1660), who is the patron saint of Christian charity. Following the Vincentian tradition, the university seeks to provide an education that encourages greater involvement in social justice, charity, and service.<ref></ref> The Vincentian Center for Church and Society, located on the university's Queens campus serves as "a clearinghouse for and developer of Vincentian information, poverty research, social justice resources, and as an academic/cultural programming Center."<ref>" urltoken Home". Vincentian Center for Church and Society. Retrieved August 25, 2015.</ref>
The St. John's University Seal bears one phrase in Latin and one in Greek. The Latin phrases "Sigillum Universitatis Sti Joannis Neo Eboraci" translates in English to "St. John's University, New York". The Greek phrase translates to "A lamp, burning, and shining", a reference to the way Jesus describes St. John the Baptist in John 5:35.<ref></ref><ref>Fr. Patrick J Griffen, The Seal of SJU: A Representation of Our Students (The Torch, Vol 93:01, April 15, ) 382 pp.</ref> The University Crest bears the Latin phrase "Educatio Christiana Animae Perfectio", which translates to "A Christian education perfects the soul".<ref name="St. John’s History & Facts"/>
 As a Catholic school run by the Vincentians, clergy can be found in positions within the administration, faculty, and spiritual staff. Crosses adorn many rooms and buildings throughout the campus, and the university maintains close ties to the Catholic Church.
===Growth===
Beginning with the law school in 1925, St. John's began establishing other graduate and undergraduate schools, and became a university in 1933. In April 1936, St. John's bought the Hillcrest Golf Club's of land for about $500,000, with the intention of eventually moving the school to the new site.<ref name= golf>"St. John's Buys University Site: Brooklyn Institution Acquires 100-Acre Tract in Jamaica Occupied by Golf Club". The New York Times. April 10, 1936. p. 25.</ref> Under the terms of the sale, the golf club continued to operate on the site for a few years.<ref name= golf/> On February 11, 1954, St. John's officially broke ground on a new campus in Hillcrest, Queens, on the former site of the Hillcrest Golf Club.<ref name= broke>"St. John's Campus in Queens is Begun". The New York Times. February 12, 1954. p. 18.</ref> During the official groundbreaking ceremony, the shovel used was the same shovel that had broken ground on the original campus in 1868.<ref name= broke/> The following year, the original school of the university, St. John's College, moved from Bedford-Stuyvesant to the new campus. The high school, now St. John's Prep, took over its former buildings and later moved to its present location in the Hillcrest-Jamaica sections in Queens.
Over approximately the next two decades, the other schools of the university, which were located at a separate campus at 96 Schermerhorn Street in Downtown Brooklyn, moved out to the new campus in Queens. The last of the schools to relocate to Queens moved there in 1972, bringing an end to the Downtown Brooklyn campus of the university. In 1959, the university established a Freedom Institute to provide lectures and programs that would, in the words of university president Rev. John A. Flynn, focus "attention on the dangers of communism threatening free institutions here and abroad," with Arpad F. Kovacs of the St. John's history department as its director.<ref>Flynn, John A. urltoken Foreword", in Kovacs, Arpad F. (1960). The Twentieth Century: An Abstract of the Main Events Which Have Shaped Our Times. St. John's University Press.</ref> (A volume of lectures given at the Freedom Institute was edited by Kovacs and published in 1961 as Let Freedom Ring.) The university also hired the noted historian Paul Kwan-Tsien Sih to establish an Institute of Asian Studies in that same year,<ref> urltoken "Paul Kwan-Tsien Sih (1909-1978)," Chinese American Who Was Who.</ref> and similarly set up a Center for African Studies under the directorship of the economic geographer Hugh C. Brooks. 
The university received praise from Time Magazine in 1962 for being a Catholic university that accepted Jews with low household income. Time also ranked St. John's as "good−small" on a list of the nation's Catholic universities in 1962.<ref></ref>
On January 27, 1971, the New York State Board of Regents approved the consolidation of the university with the former Notre Dame College (New York), a private women's college, and the Staten Island campus of St. John's University became a reality. Classes began in the fall of 1971, combining the original Notre Dame College with the former Brooklyn campus of St. John's, offering undergraduate degrees in liberal arts, business and education.<ref name=StatenIslandHistory></ref>
===Further expansion (1999-Present)===
Circa 1989, according to Steve Fishman of New York Magazine, "St. John’s was essentially a commuter school" but that changed after Father Donald Harrington became the president of the university that year, replacing Father Joseph Cahill. Under Harrington the school increased its infrastructure and international profile.<ref name=Fishmanp2></ref> By 1990 the tuition and fees at St. John's was less than half of that at schools like NYU and Columbia.<ref></ref> Moreover, in 1999, the university completed the first residence halls on the main Queens campus, making it easier for out-of-state and international students to attend the flagship campus.<ref name="St. John’s History & Facts"/> The University is now entering a new chapter under the leadership of Father Brian Shanley. Fr. Shanley is the former president of Providence College and is credited in bringing much growth to the college.
Beginning in 1995, the university began a series of acquisitions lasting for the following 22 years and establishing new locations throughout New York and the world.
*Rome Campus. In 1995 St. John's establishes its first international campus in Rome, Italy. The campus offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees.<ref name="St. John’s History & Facts"/>
*Oakdale Campus. The university acquired 175 acres in 1999 near Oakdale, NY to provide both undergraduate and graduate programs in eastern Long Island. The land was previously the home of the LaSalle Military Academy. The property was eventual sold in 2017 when St. John's opened a second graduate center on Long Island.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
*Manhattan Campus. St. John's acquired The College of Insurance in Manhattan, in 2001. The school was converted to the School of Risk Management and added several programs to the St. John's academic portfolio, including Actuary Science. The campus also included additional dormitories in downtown Manhattan.<ref name="St. John’s History & Facts"/><ref></ref>
*Paris Location. In 2008 the university established a location in Paris, France with residential accommodations and multiple programs. The locations purpose allowing students to complete a portion of their studies under St. John's faculty in France while being exposed to the cultural offerings of the city.<ref name="St. John’s History & Facts"/><ref></ref>
*Long Island Graduate Center. After selling the Oakdale campus, St. John's established the Long Island Graduate Center in 2017 in Hauppauge, NY (Long Island). The campus offers programs at the master, advanced certificate, and doctoral levels.
===Other notable events===
The St. John's University strike of 1966-1967 was a protest by faculty at the university which began on January 4, 1966, and ended in June 1967.<ref></ref> The strike began after 31 faculty members were dismissed in the fall of 1965 without due process, dismissals which some felt were a violation of the professors' academic freedom. The strike ended without any reinstatements, but led to the widespread unionization of public college faculty in the New York City area. In 1970 arbitrators ruled that the university had not acted improperly.
In 2010 federal prosecutors arrested Dr. Cecilia Chang, dean of the school's Institute of Asian Studies, and charged her with embezzling money from the university, bribing students with scholarships in exchange for forced labor, tax evasion, and false statements to federal agents.<ref name=Rashbaumetal></ref> Chang, a graduate student alumna from Taiwan<ref name=Fishmanp1></ref> who naturalized in 1989, began directing the Asian Center and acted as a fundraiser in 1977.<ref name=Fishmanp2/> On Monday November 5, 2012,<ref name=Fishmanp1/> she testified in her own trial and committed suicide at age 59 the next day.<ref name=Rashbaumetal/> Anne Hendershot of Crisis Magazine wrote that the information revealed that described Chang giving material benefits to other members of the administration was "even more damaging to the reputation of St. John’s University."<ref></ref>
