Trưng sisters

==Historical background==
The former Qin commander Zhao Tuo (Wade–Giles: Chao T'o) established the state of Nanyueh in 204 BC, had conquered Âu Lạc in 180 BC, incorporated the Vietnamese realm into Chinese rules. In 112 BC, Emperor Wu of Han dispatched soldiers against Nanyue and the kingdom was annexed in 111 BC during the ensuing Han–Nanyue War. Nine commanderies were established to administer the region, three of which are located in modern-day northern Vietnam. Revolts against the Han began in AD 40 led by the Trưng sisters. 
==Biography==
The Trưng sisters were daughters of a wealthy aristocratic family of Lac ethnicity. Their father had been a Lac lord in Mê Linh district (modern-day Mê Linh District, Hanoi). Trưng Trắc (Cheng Ts'e)'s husband was Thi Sách (Shi Sou), was also the Lac lord of Chu Diên (modern-day Khoái Châu District, Hưng Yên Province). Su Ding, the Chinese governor of Jiaozhi province at the time, is remembered by his cruelty and tyranny. According to Chinese records, Thi Sách was "of a fierce temperament", and Su Ting attempted to restrain him with legal procedures, literally
beheaded him without trial. Trưng Trắc fearless stirred her husband to action and became the central figure in mobilizing the Lac lords against the Chinese. In March of AD 40, Trưng Trắc and her younger sister Trưng Nhị (Cheng Erh), led the Luoyue people to rise up in rebellion against the Han. The Hou Han Shu recorded that Trưng Trắc launched the rebellion in avenge the killing of her dissent husband. It began at the Red River Delta, but soon spread to other Lac tribes and non-Han people from an area stretching from Hepu to Rinan. Chinese settlements were overran, and Su Ting fled. The uprising gained the support of about sixty-five towns and settlements. Trưng Trắc was proclaimed as the queen.
In AD 42, the Han emperor commissioned general Ma Yuan to suppress the rebellion with 32,000 men. The rebellion of the two sisters was defeated in the next year as Ma Yuan captured and decapitated Trưng Trắc and Trưng Nhị, then sent their head to the Han court in Luoyang.
The Sung dynasty poet and calligrapher Huang Tingjian (1045–1105) compared the Trưng sisters to Lü Chia, the prime minister of Nanyue who resisted Han Wu di's army in 112 BC:
::Lü Chia refused treasonous brides;
::Trưng Trắc raised her shield to resist oppression
==Historiography==
The primary historical source for the sisters is the 5th century Book of the Later Han compiled by historian Fan Ye, which covers the history of the Han Dynasty from 6 to CE 189. The secondary source, but the primary popular source, is the Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư (Complete Annals of Dai Viet) compiled by Ngô Sĩ Liên under the order of the Emperor Lê Thánh Tông and finished in 1479.
===Chinese Sources===
The Chinese traditional historical accounts on the Trưng sisters are remarkably brief. They are found in several different chapters of the Book of the Later Han, the history for the Eastern Han Dynasty, against which the Trưng sisters had carried out their uprising.
====Book of Later Han; 5th century CE====
Chapter eighty-six of the Book of the Later Han, entitled Biographies of the Southern and the Southwestern Barbarians,<ref group="Note">The use of the word barbarians is historical, and is translated as used in the original Chinese texts.</ref> has this short passage:<ref>Hou Hanshu, urltoken Vol. 86</ref><ref>As quoted in Gujin Tushu Jicheng urltoken Vol. 421</ref>
<blockquote>In the 16th year of the Jianwu era (40 CE), Jiaozhi (交阯; WD: Chiao-chih) woman Zheng Ce (徵側; SV: Trưng Trắc) and her younger sister Zheng Er (徵貳; SV: Trưng Nhị) rebelled and attacked the commandery's strongholds. As for Zheng Ce, she was the daughter of the Luo general of Miling prefecture (麊泠; SV: Mê Linh). She was married as wife to Shi Suo (詩索; SV: Thi Sách), a man in Zhouyuan (朱鳶; SV: Chu Diên). She was remarkably heroic and couragerous. Su Ding (蘇定; WD: Su Ting), the administrator of Jiaozhi restrained her (them?) with law; Ce became infuriated, rebelled, and attacked. Thus, the barbarian villages in Jiuzhen (九眞; WD Chiu-chen), Rinan (日南; WD:Jih-nan), Hepu (合浦; WD: Hop'u) all supported her. All in all, she took sixty-five strongholds and established herself as queen. Jiaozhi's governor and administrators could but defend themselves. (Emperor) Guangwu thus decreed that Changsha (長沙; WD: Ch'ang-sha), Hepu, and Jiaozhi, all must furnish chariots and boats, repair roads and bridges, dredge obstructed waterways, and store foods and provisions. In the 18th year (42 CE), he dispatched Wave-Subduing General Ma Yuan (馬援 ; WD: Ma Yüan), Building-and-Boat General Duanzhi (段志 ; SV: Đoạn Chí) [and Household General Liu Long (劉隆; WD: Liu Long),<ref group="Note">Liu Long was not mentioned here, yet Hou Hanshu's urltoken Account of Liu Long recorded that he also participated in this campaign against Trưng Trắc, and that he caught Trưng Nhị at the Forbidden Gorge (禁谿), beheaded over 1,000, and subdued over 20,000 rebels</ref> who led over 10,000 troops from Ch'ang-sha, Guilin (桂陽; SV: Quế Dương); Lingling (零陵; SV: Linh Lăng); Cangwu (蒼梧; SV: Thương Ngô) on a punitive expedition. Summer next year (43 CE), in the fourth month, Ma Yuan devastated Jiaozhi, beheaded Zheng Ce, Zheng Er, and others; the rest all surrendered or scattered. He advanced and attacked the Jiuzhen's rebel Du Yang (都陽; SV: Đô Dương) and others, routing and subduing them. He exiled over 300 rebel leaders to Lingling. Thus the regions Lingnan were entirely pacified.</blockquote>
Chapter twenty-four, the biographies of Ma and some of his notable male descendants, had a parallel description that also added that Ma was able to impress the locals by creating irrigation networks to help the people and also by simplifying and clarifying the Han laws, and was able to get the people to follow Han's laws.
====Records of Jiao Province's Outer Territories, 4th century CE====
An older, yet less-known account, from the now-lost Records of Jiao Province's Outer Territories (交州外域記) was quoted in the 6th-century word Commentary on the Water Classic (水經注) by Northern Wei geographer Li Daoyuan:<ref>Li Daoyuan Commentary on the Water Classic, urltoken Vol. 37</ref>
<blockquote>Later, the son of Zhouyuan's Luo general, named Shi (詩; SV: Thi), asked<ref group="Note">The original manuscript contains no punctuation. The two characters "詩索", to be read as 'Shi/Thi asked', were instead misread as the name Shi Suo/Thi Sách; 索 "to ask" is the main verb of this sentence "後朱䳒雒將子名詩索𥹆泠雒將女名徵側爲妻"</ref> the daughter of Ming<ref group="Note">𥹆 míng is possibly a clerical error for 麊 mí</ref> ling's Luo general, named Zheng Ce (徵側; SV: Trưng Trắc), to be his wife. Ce was a bold and courageous human being. Alongsides Shi, she uprose and rebelled, attacking and devastating Jiao Province, as well as reducing the Luo generals into subordination. Zheng Ce made herself queen. Starting from Miling prefecture, she occupied two divisions Jiaozhi and Jiuzhen, and for two years taxed the people. Later on, the Han (court) dispatched Wave-Subduing General to lead troops on a punitive expedition. Ce and Shi fled into the Golden Gorge (金溪 SV; Kim Khê). Ma Yuan hunted them down and captured them after three years. Now from Western Shu there were also troops dispatched on punitive expedition against Ce and Shi and others and all those commanderies and prefectures were pacified; then magistrates were instituted there.</blockquote>
The traditional Chinese accounts differed from Vietnamese traditional accounts in many places: Chinese accounts do not indicate oppression of the Vietnamese population by the Chinese officials and Su Ding's killing of Trưng Trắc's husband. In the Chinese account, the Trưng sisters did not commit suicide. Chinese sources also contradicted accounts in Vietnamese folk history that the Trưng sisters' retainers followed their examples and also committed suicide.
===Vietnamese Chronicles===
====Excerpts from Complete Annals of Đại Việt, 1479====
The third book of Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư (Complete Annals of Dai Viet),<ref></ref><ref></ref> published in editions between 1272 and 1697, has the following to say about the Trưng Sisters:

==Cultural significance==
===Nationalism===
The Trưng Sisters are highly revered in Vietnam, as they led the first resistance movement against the occupying Chinese after 247 years of domination. Many temples are dedicated to them, and a yearly holiday in February to commemorate their deaths is observed by many Vietnamese. A central district in Hanoi called the Hai Bà Trưng District is named after them, as are numerous large streets in major cities<ref name="periplus_2011"></ref> and many schools.
The stories of the Trưng Sisters and of another famous woman warrior, Lady Triệu, are cited by some historians as hints that Vietnamese society before sinicization was a matriarchy one, where there are no obstacles for women in assuming leadership roles.
Even though the Trưng Sisters' revolt against the Chinese was almost 2000 years ago, its legacy in Vietnam remains.<ref>Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David: Vietnam Past and Present: The North (History and culture of Hanoi and Tonkin). Chiang Mai. Cognoscenti Books, 2012. </ref> The two sisters are considered to be a national symbol in Vietnam. They represent Vietnam's independence. They are often depicted as two women riding two giant war elephants. Many times, they are seen leading their followers into battle against the Chinese. The Trưng sisters were more than two sisters that gave their life up for their country, they are powerful symbols of Vietnamese resistance and freedom.
Their strong defiance and devote for Vietnamese freedom nonetheless, has been greatly appreciated by not just Vietnamese but even foreign leaders. The U.S. President Donald Trump has recalled their heroism to be one of the greatest achievement of Vietnamese people during the APEC Vietnam 2017.<ref></ref>
===Temples===
Temples to the Trưng Sisters or Hai Bà Trưng Temples were found from as early as the end of the Third Chinese domination of Vietnam. The best known Hai Bà Trưng Temple is in Hanoi near Hoàn Kiếm Lake. Other Hai Bà Trưng temples are found in Mê Linh District (Vĩnh Phúc Province), Phúc Thọ District (Hà Tây Province) and Hoàng Hoa Thám Street, Bình Thạnh District, Ho Chi Minh City.
===Women's status===
One reason for the defeat is desertion by rebels because they did not believe they could win under a woman's leadership. The fact that women were in charge was blamed as a reason for the defeat by historical Vietnamese texts in which the historians ridiculed and mocked men because they did nothing while "mere girls", whom they viewed with revulsion, took up the banner of revolt.<ref name="McKayHill2012"></ref> The historical poem containing the phrase "mere girls", which related the revolt of the Trung Sisters while the men did nothing, was not intended to praise women nor view war as women's work, as it has been wrongly interpreted.<ref></ref>

==Notes==

; Chinese pinyin: Zheng Er ; Wade–Giles: Cheng<sup>1</sup> Erh<sup>4</sup>). Trưng Trắc was the first woman to be a Vietnamese monarch as well as the only queen regnant in the history of Vietnam (Lý Chiêu Hoàng was the second woman to take the reign and is the only empress regnant).
The sisters were born in Giao Chi, in rural Northern Vietnam, a commandery of the Han dynasty (and in modern Northern Vietnam). The dates of their births are unknown, but Trưng Trắc was older than Trưng Nhị. The exact dates of their deaths are also unknown but both died around CE 43 after a battle against an army led by Ma Yuan.
The Trưng sisters were highly educated under the watchful eyes of their father; they excelled in both literature and martial arts. Both were in line to inherit their father's land and titles.<ref></ref>
