Uri Geller

==Controversial performances==
As part of a mass demonstration, Geller’s photograph appeared on the cover of the magazine ESP with the caption "On Sept. 1, 1976 at 11pm E.D.T. THIS COVER CAN BEND YOUR KEYS." According to editor Howard Smukler, over 300 positive responses were received, many including bent objects and detailed descriptions of the surrounding circumstances including the bending of the key to the city of Providence, Rhode Island.<ref></ref>
Television presenter Noel Edmonds often used hidden cameras to record celebrities in Candid Camera-like situations for his television programme, Noel's House Party. In 1996, Edmonds planned a stunt in which shelves would fall from the walls of a room while Geller was in it. The cameras recorded footage of Geller from angles he was not expecting, and they showed Geller grasping a spoon firmly with both hands as he stood up to display a bend in it.<ref> Excerpt from "James Randi's Solved Mysteries Workshop", a talk given by Randi during the 1998 Skeptics Society Convention.</ref>
In late 2006 and early 2007, Geller starred in The Successor, an Israeli television show to find his "successor." During one segment, a compass was made to move, apparently as a result of Geller's paranormal abilities. Critics say slow-motion footage of the episode showed Geller attaching a magnet to his thumb immediately prior to the compass's movement.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Geller denied that this was sleight of hand, and said he welcomed the "mystical aura" that the publicity gave him.<ref></ref>
Geller performed the same compass trick in 2000 on ABC TV's The View, which was later duplicated by Randi on the same show the following week.<ref name="compass2000"></ref>
==Litigation==
Geller has litigated or threatened legal action against some of his critics with mixed success.<ref name="truzzi"> urltoken mirror</ref> These included libel allegations against James Randi and illusionist Gérard Majax.
In 1971, a mechanical engineering student called Uri Goldstein attended one of Geller's shows, and subsequently sued the show's promoters for breach of contract. He complained that Geller had promised a demonstration of several psychic powers but had delivered only sleight-of-hand and stage tricks. The case came before the civil court in Beersheba.<ref>Randi, James (1982) The Truth About Uri Geller, Prometheus Books, pp. viii, 198, 215, . Randi quotes "Legerdemain ruled breach of contract", Jerusalem Post, 5 January 1971. Quoted in urltoken An Apology from James Randi Urigeller.com.</ref> Geller was not present as the summons had been sent to the office of the promoter Miki Peled, who had ignored it as being trivial. Goldstein was awarded 27.5 lira (around $5) for breach of contract. Later, Goldstein admitted that he went to the show specifically with the intention of suing to get his money back, and he had already found a lawyer to represent him prior to attending the performance.<ref>Margolis, Jonathan. (1998). Uri Geller Magician or Mystic. Orion Publishing Group. p. 113. </ref>
In a 1989 interview with a Japanese newspaper, James Randi was quoted as saying that Geller had driven a scientist to "shoot himself in the head" after finding out that Geller had fooled him. Randi afterwards claimed it was a metaphor lost in translation.<ref name="cuckoos"> urltoken Cuckoos and Cocoa Puffs by Carol Krol Skeptical Eye – Vol. 8, No. 3, 1995, a newsletter published by the National Capital Area Skeptics (NCAS)</ref> The story was also repeated in a Canadian newspaper, which quoted Randi as saying essentially the same thing: "One scientist, a metallurgist, wrote a paper backing Geller's claims that he could bend metal. The scientist shot himself after I showed him how the key bending trick was done."<ref>Orwen, Patricia (23 August 1986) urltoken The Amazing Randi, Toronto Star. p. M.1</ref> In 1990, Geller sued Randi in a Japanese court over the statements published in the Japanese newspaper. Randi claims that he could not afford to defend himself, therefore he lost the case by default. The court declared Randi's statement an "insult" as opposed to libel, and awarded a token judgement against him, paying Geller only "one-third of one-percent of what he'd demanded".<ref name="randi 1994"/> Since the charge of "insult" is only recognized in Chinese and Japanese law, Randi was not required to pay.<ref name="randi 1994"></ref><ref name="geller_psir"></ref><ref name="randi 2007"></ref> Later in 1995, Geller agreed not to pursue payment of the Japanese fine.<ref name="truzzi"/> Randi maintains that he has never paid anything to Geller.<ref name="randi 2007" />
In 1992, Geller filed a $15 million suit against Randi and CSICOP for statements made in an International Herald Tribune interview on 9 April 1991,<ref name="truzzi"/><ref name="cuckoos"/> but he was unsuccessful because the statute of limitations had expired.<ref name="truzzi"/> In 1994, Geller asked to dismiss without prejudice, and he was ordered to pay $50,000 for the publisher's attorney fees. After not paying in time, Geller was sanctioned with an additional $20,000. Due to the sanction, the suit was dismissed with prejudice, which, according to Randi's attorneys, means that Geller cannot pursue the same suit in any other jurisdiction.<ref name="truzzi"/><ref name="CiscopLibel" ></ref><ref> urltoken Geller v. Randi, US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, 1994.</ref> In 1995, Geller and Randi announced that this settled "the last remaining suits" between him and the CSICOP.<ref name="geller_psir"/> As part of the settlement, Geller agreed not to pursue the payment of the 1990 Japanese ruling, in exchange for Prometheus Books inserting an errata on all future editions of Physics and Psychics, correcting erroneous statements made about him.<ref name="geller_psir"/>
In 1991, Geller sued Timex Group USA and the advertising firm Fallon Worldwide for millions in Geller v. Fallon McElligott<ref>(No. 90-Civ-2839, 22 July 1991)</ref> over an ad showing a person bending forks and other items, but failing to stop a Timex watch. Geller was sanctioned $149,000 for filing a frivolous lawsuit.<ref name="randi 1994" />
In 1998, the Broadcasting Standards Commission (BSC) in the United Kingdom rejected a complaint made by Geller, saying that it "wasn't unfair to have magicians showing how they duplicate those 'psychic feats'" on the UK Equinox episode "Secrets of the Super Psychics".<ref>this film, made by Open Media, was known on first transmission as Secrets of the Psychics but should not be confused with the earlier Nova film of the same name</ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
In 1999, Geller considered a suit against IKEA over a furniture line featuring bent legs that was called the "Uri" line.<ref></ref>
==Copyright claims==
In November 2000, Geller sued video game company Nintendo for £60 million over the Pokémon species "", localized in English as "Kadabra", which he claimed was an unauthorized appropriation of his identity.<ref></ref><ref name="gellerbbc"></ref> The Pokémon in question has psychic abilities and carries a bent spoon. Geller also claimed that the star on Kadabra's forehead and the lightning patterns on its abdomen are symbolisms popular with the Waffen SS of Nazi Germany.<ref name="gellerbbc" /> The katakana for the character's name, ユンゲラー, is visually similar to the transliteration of Geller's own name into Japanese (ユリゲラー). He is quoted as saying: "Nintendo turned me into an evil, occult Pokémon character. Nintendo stole my identity by using my name and my signature image."<ref name="gellerbbc" /> Pokémon anime director and storyboard artist Masamitsu Hidaka confirmed in an interview that Kadabra would not be used on a Pokémon Trading Card until an agreement was reached on the case. In November 2020, Geller issued an apology and agreed to allow cards depicting Kadabra to be printed,<ref></ref><ref></ref> though the last Kadabra card released was in the Skyridge e-Reader set (2002/2003).<ref></ref>
 
In 2007, Geller issued a DMCA notice to YouTube to remove a video uploaded by Brian Sapient of the "Rational Response Squad" which was excerpted from an episode of the Nova television program titled "Secrets of the Psychics". The video included footage of Geller failing to perform. In response, Sapient contacted the Electronic Frontier Foundation, issued a DMCA counter-notice, and sued Geller for misuse of the DMCA. Geller's company, Explorologist, filed a counter-suit. Both cases were settled out of court; a monetary settlement was paid (but it is not clear whether Sapient paid Geller or vice versa) and the eight seconds of footage owned by Explorologist were licensed under a noncommercial Creative Commons license.<ref> urltoken Sapient v.

==Property==
On 11 February 2009, Geller purchased the uninhabited 100-metre-by-50-metre Lamb island off the eastern coast of Scotland, previously known for its witch trials, and beaches that Robert Louis Stevenson is said to have described in his novel Treasure Island. Geller claims that buried on the island is Egyptian treasure, brought there by Scota, the mythological half-sister of Tutankhamen in Irish mythology, 3,500 years ago. He claimed that he will find the treasure through dowsing. Geller also claimed to have strengthened the mystical powers of the island by burying there a crystal orb once belonging to Albert Einstein.<ref>Wall Street Journal, 23 August 2010, 1. The article quoted Geller as saying that "I'm certain there are ancient Egyptian artifacts there. It's only a matter of time until we find them."</ref><ref></ref>
In 2014, a 12-foot-tall statue of a gorilla made from approximately 40,000 metal spoons was unveiled in Geller's Berkshire garden by the Duke of Kent, with the intention of possibly relocating it to Great Ormond Street Hospital.<ref></ref> The statue was welded by sculptor Alfie Bradley, and funded by the British Ironworks Centre of Oswestry. According to Bradley, many of the spoons were donated by schoolchildren from around the world. Speaking at the unveiling, Geller said "This will not raise money for charity. It will do something better. It will amaze sick children."<ref></ref>
==2013 BBC documentary==
In 2013, a BBC documentary, The Secret Life of Uri Geller – Psychic Spy? featured Uri Geller, Benjamin Netanyahu, Christopher 'Kit' Green, Paul H. Smith, Harold Puthoff and Russell Targ. The documentary claimed Geller became a "psychic spy" for the CIA, was recruited by Mossad, and worked as an "official secret agent" in Mexico, being a frequent guest of President José López Portillo. In the film, Geller claims to have erased floppy discs carried by KGB agents by repeatedly chanting the word "erase".<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
==Personal life==
Geller has lived in Tel Aviv in Israel since 2015.<ref></ref> He previously lived in the village of Sonning, Berkshire, in the United Kingdom.<ref></ref><ref></ref> He is trilingual, speaking fluent Hebrew, Hungarian and English.<ref></ref> In an appearance on Esther Rantzen's 1996 television talk show Esther, Geller declared that he had suffered from anorexia nervosa and bulimia<ref name="Glammonitor"></ref> for several years.<ref name="Telegraph anorexia"></ref> He has written 16 fiction and non-fiction books.
Michael Jackson was best man when Geller renewed his wedding vows in 2001.<ref></ref> Geller also negotiated the TV interview between Jackson with the journalist Martin Bashir, Living with Michael Jackson.<ref></ref> Later, however, Jackson, who an advisor said could be a bit paranoid, reportedly kept an “enemy list” on which Geller appeared, along with Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, attorney Gloria Allred, music executive Tommy Mottola, DA Tom Sneddon, and Janet Arvizo, mother of a Jackson accuser.<ref></ref>
Geller is president of International Friends of Magen David Adom, a group that lobbied the International Committee of the Red Cross to recognise Magen David Adom ("Red Star of David") as a humanitarian relief organisation.<ref> urltoken Red Cross panel votes to admit Israeli agency as member, San Francisco Chronicle, 8 December 2005</ref>
In 1997, he tried to help the Second Division football club Exeter City win a crucial end of season game by placing "energy-infused" crystals behind the goals at Exeter's ground (Exeter lost the game 5–1); he was appointed co-chairman of the club in 2002. The club was relegated to the Football Conference in May 2003, where it remained for five years. He has since severed ties with the club. He had also been involved with Reading F.C. and claimed in 2002 that he had helped them to avoid relegation by getting the club's supporters to look into his eyes and say "win, Reading, win". Reading manager Alan Pardew dismissed Geller's role in the club's survival – which was achieved thanks to a draw in the crucial match – stating "as soon as we get a bit of joy, thanks to all the hard work and efforts of my staff and players, he suddenly comes out of the blue and tries to claim the limelight."<ref></ref>
Following the death of Michael Jackson, ITV broadcast an interview with Geller about his association with Jackson, titled My Friend Michael Jackson: Uri's Story, in July 2009.<ref></ref>

This appearance on The Tonight Show, which Carson and Randi had orchestrated to debunk Geller's claimed abilities, backfired. According to Higginbotham,
