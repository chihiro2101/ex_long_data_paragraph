Acilia gens

==Praenomina==
The Acilii were particularly fond of the praenomen Manius, which they used more than any other. They also used the names Gaius, Lucius, Caeso, and Marcus.
==Branches and cognomina==
The three main branches of the Acilii bore the cognomina Aviola, Balbus, and Glabrio.<ref name="DGRBM Acilia Gens"/>
The Glabriones were the first family to appear in history, and they continued the longest. Members of this family have been identified from the third century BC into the fifth century AD, a span of time that no other Roman family can be proved to have bridged. According to Millar, "the one indubitable case of continuity from the republic to the fourth century is the Acilii Glabriones."<ref>Millar, p. 341, note 1.</ref> They were certainly plebeian, as many of them were tribunes of the plebs.<ref>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 270 ("Glabrio").</ref> They also had a garden, the , on the Pincian Hill in the 2nd century. A tomb of the Acilii Glabriones was found in Rome in 1888. The surname Glabrio is derived from the adjective , "smooth", and probably referred to someone who was bald.<ref name="Chase 110">Chase, p. 110.</ref> Dondin-Payre suggests that, interpreted as "hairless" or "depilated", Glabrio had the further connotation of "effeminate".<ref>Dondin-Payre, Les Acilii Glabriones, p. 34.</ref>
The Acilii Balbi, like the Glabriones, were definitely plebeian. The surname Balbus was quite common at Rome, and originally given to one who stammered. A coin of this family depicts the head of Athena within a laurel wreath on the obverse, and on the reverse, a quadriga bearing Jupiter and Victoria.<ref>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 455 ("Balbus").</ref><ref name="Chase 110"/>
The Acilii Aviolae appear at the very end of the Republic, or under the early emperors. There is some confusion between them and the Glabriones, with the consul of BC 33 being identified as Marcus Acilius Glabrio in some writers, and Manius Acilius Aviola in others. Given the antiquity of the Glabriones, it seems likely that one of them was the ancestor of the Aviolae, and might have used both surnames at various points in time. As for the name Aviola, it seems to be a diminutive, presumably of , "grandmother".<ref>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 434 ("Aviola").</ref><ref>New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. avia.</ref>

The gens Acilia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome, that flourished from the middle of the third century BC until at least the fifth century AD, a period of seven hundred years. The first of the gens to achieve prominence was Gaius Acilius, who was quaestor in 203 and tribune of the plebs in 197 BC.<ref name="DGRBM Acilia Gens">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 13 ("Acilia Gens").</ref>
