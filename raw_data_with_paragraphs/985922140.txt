Stanley Berenstain and Janice Grant met in 1941, on their first day of drawing class at the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art, where they formed an immediate bond.<ref name="martin">Martin, Douglas. urltoken "Stan Berenstain, Co-Creator of Those Fuzzy Bears, Dies at 82."

In the early 1960s, the Berenstains sought to enter the field of writing for young children.<ref name="martin"/> For their first children's book, they chose to cast bears as the main characters, primarily because the animal held wide appeal and could be drawn easily.<ref name="martin"/><ref name="mehren"/> Stan also observed that female bears are "terrifyingly good mothers" while the males are "lousy fathers."<ref name="mehren"/> (The Berenstains denied that their last name had anything to do with the decision.)<ref name="mehren"/><ref name="weeks">Weeks, Linton. "The Bear Essentials." The Washington Post, May 13, 1996.</ref> In their 2002 memoir, they said that they knew from the start that their book would "have three characters: a bluff, overenthusiastic Papa Bear who wore bib overalls and a plaid shirt and.a wise Mama Bear who wore a blue dress with white polka dots.and a bright, lively little cub."<ref name="asim"/>
The Berenstains' first bear story, titled Freddy Bear's Spanking, arrived on the desk of Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, who had found phenomenal success in 1957 with The Cat in the Hat and was now editor of a Random House series called "Beginner Books".<ref name="weeks"/> Geisel took on the manuscript, but spent the next two years ruthlessly challenging the Berenstains to make improvements to the writing and structure and to connect with their characters on a deeper level.<ref name="loviglio"/><ref name="weeks"/><ref name="shattuck">Shattuck, Kathryn. urltoken "For Young Viewers; The Family Next Door: Furry and Full of Fun." The New York Times, January 5, 2003.</ref> He asked questions such as "What kind of pipe smoking does Papa Bear smoke?" and urged them to analyze the relationship between Papa Bear and Small Bear, to which Stan responded, mystified, "Well, he's the father, and he's the son"; however, Jan attributed the inspiration for the characters' dynamic to the 1931 film The Champ.<ref name="martin"/><ref name="mehren"/>

The book was finally published in 1962 under the title The Big Honey Hunt, with no plans to revisit the bears in a sequel.<ref name="mehren"/><ref name="weeks"/> Geisel had told the Berenstains to feature a different animal in their next story, as "there are already too many bears. Sendak's got some kind of bear. There's Yogi Bear, the Three Bears, Smokey Bear, the Chicago Bears. for your next book you should do something as different from bears as possible."<ref name="asim"/> They had started work on a new project featuring a penguin when Geisel called and told them: "We're selling the hell out of the bear book."<ref name="mehren"/><ref name="asim"/> The second bear book, The Bike Lesson, appeared in 1964, featuring the names Stan and Jan Berenstain instead of Stanley and Janice; Geisel had changed the credit without consulting them.

Over the next several decades, Stan and Jan collaborated on hundreds of books from their home studio outside Philadelphia.<ref name="loviglio"/><ref name="asim"/> After developing a storyline together, one of them (usually Stan) would develop a first draft, which the other would then refine into an 1100-word manuscript. They also worked together on the illustrations.<ref name="mehren"/> In 2002, the couple released a memoir of their career titled Down A Sunny Dirt Road.<ref name="asim"/>
Their sons Leo and Mike also entered the family business after making their own forays into children's publishing as an author and illustrator, respectively.<ref name="weeks"/> In the 1990s, the men worked on the Berenstain Bears "Big Chapter Book" series (published under the names Stan and Jan Berenstain).<ref name="weeks"/> Following Stan's death from lymphoma in 2005, Mike collaborated with his mother on writing and illustrating Berenstain Bears installments, while Leo has been involved with the business side of the franchise.<ref name="loviglio"/> Jan Berenstain died in February 2012 following a stroke.<ref name=philly022812>Schaffer, Michael D., and Bill Reed. urltoken "A bear-hug farewell to Jan Berenstain, cocreator of the Bear family."

==Characters and themes==
The Berenstain Bears, who reside "in a big treehouse down a sunny dirt road deep in Bear Country," consists of Papa Bear, an oafish, bumbling carpenter; wise Mama Bear, a housewife and perfectionist; and their children, Brother Bear (originally Small Bear), and later additions Sister Bear and Honey Bear.<ref name="martin"/><ref name="weeks"/><ref name="stevens">Stevens, Heidi. urltoken "Berenstain Bears remain faithful."

"Name the baby." Publishers Weekly, March 13, 2000.</ref>
Stories about the bears generally follow a basic formula, so described by the Berenstains: "Papa sets out to instruct Small Bear in some aspect of the art of living and ends up badly the worse for wear, with Small Bear expressing his appreciation for the fine lesson Papa has taught him."<ref name="asim"/> In the words of The Washington Posts Paul Farhi, "The action usually starts when the kids face a problem. They turn to Papa, who offers a "solution" that only makes the problem—or the kids' fears about it—even worse. Enter Mama, who eventually sets everyone straight."<ref name="farhi20051201">Farhi, Paul. urltoken "Stan Berenstain's Honey-Coated Medicine." The Washington Post, 2005-12-01, p. C1.</ref>
The litany of issues confronted by the Berenstain Bears over their fifty years of publication include bullying, messiness, poor sportsmanship, visiting the dentist, online safety, and childhood obesity, among countless others.<ref name="loviglio"/><ref name="mehren"/><ref name="graeber">Graeber, Laurel. urltoken "Bears With a Treehouse And Tidy Tales for Children." The New York Times, July 10, 2011.</ref> The Berenstains often drew inspiration from their own family experiences, which Stan credited for the series' continued relevance: "Kids still tell fibs and they mess up their rooms and they still throw tantrums in the supermarket.Nobody gets shot. No violence. There are problems, but they're the kind of typical family problems everyone goes through."<ref name="AP20090211"/><ref name="shattuck"/> The couple also claimed, in response to criticism of the characterization of Papa and Mama Bear, that those characters were heavily inspired by Stan and Jan Berenstain themselves.<ref name="mehren"/><ref name="weeks"/>
==Books==
==Reception==
The Berenstain Bears series had sold over 240 million copies by 2003. Of their books, 35 are in the Publishers Weekly top 250 titles of all time, and 15 are in the top 100 children's paperbacks.<ref name="psu"/> The series has received praise and awards for its contributions to children's literature<ref name="Scholastic"> urltoken Stan Berenstain | Scholastic</ref> as well as condemnation for promoting outdated gender roles, simplistic and unrealistic messages, and not keeping up with the times.<ref name="Langer"/>
===Criticism===
Critics of the series have called it "syrupy", "unsatisfying", "infuriatingly formulaic", "hokey", "abominable", and "little more than stern lectures dressed up as children's stories."<ref name="farhi19890903">Farhi, Paul; Keyahias, Lisa. urltoken "The New Children's Books: Grimmer than Grimm." The Washington Post, 1989-09-03, p. C05.</ref><ref name="weeks"/><ref>Olney, Kathryn. urltoken "Bearly there." Salon.com, February 2, 1999.</ref><ref>Kochakian, Mary Jo. urltoken "The Berenstains Would Be Fine If Papa Bear Had A Bigger Brain." Hartford Courant, August 11, 1998.</ref>
In a 1989 editorial titled "Drown the Berenstain Bears", The Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer lamented the popularity of the books, writing that "it is not just the smugness and complacency of the stories that is so irritating," but the bears themselves, particularly "the post-feminist Papa Bear, the Alan Alda of grizzlies, a wimp so passive and fumbling he makes Dagwood Bumstead look like Batman." He described Mama Bear as "the final flowering of the grade-school prissy, the one with perfect posture and impeccable handwriting.and now you have to visit her every night. The reason is, of course, that kids love them. My boy, 4, cannot get enough of these bears."<ref>Krauthammer, Charles. urltoken "Drown the Berenstain Bears." The Washington Post, August 18, 1989.</ref>
Upon the death of Stan Berenstain in 2005, The Washington Post published an "Appreciation" piece which many Post readers found surprisingly unappreciative in its tone. Written by Paul Farhi, who had previously rebuked the Berenstain Bears as the most popular example of a lamentable and misguided "self-help" genre aimed at children,<ref name="farhi19890903"/> the 2005 piece revived his earlier sentiments:
<blockquote>The larger questions about the popularity of the Berenstain Bears are more troubling: Is this what we really want from children's books in the first place, a world filled with scares and neuroses and problems to be toughed out and solved? And if it is, aren't the Berenstain Bears simply teaching to the test, providing a lesson to be spit back, rather than one lived and understood and embraced? Where is the warmth, the spirit of discovery and imagination in Bear Country? Stan Berenstain taught a million lessons to children, but subtlety and plain old joy weren't among them.<ref name="farhi20051201"/></blockquote>
Subsequent letters from readers condemned Farhi for expressing such harshness toward the recently deceased; one wrote, "In the name of fairness, please be sure to allow the Berenstain family the opportunity to someday retort in Farhi's obituary."<ref name="beating"> urltoken "Beating Up on Stan Berenstain." The Washington Post, December 10, 2005.</ref> Readers also defended the books' "warmth" and their enduring popularity among young children.<ref name="beating"/><ref>"Unappreciated." The Washington Post, December 2, 2005.</ref>
Slates Hanna Rosin revived Krauthammer's complaints, drawing criticism for writing of Jan Berenstain's death, "As any right-thinking mother will agree, good riddance. Among my set of mothers the series is known mostly as the one that makes us dread the bedtime routine the most." (Rosin subsequently apologized and admitted she "was not really thinking of Berenstain as a person with actual feelings and a family, just an abstraction who happened to write these books.")<ref>Rosin, Hanna. urltoken "Berenstain Bores."

===Awards and praise===
The Berenstain Bears series has been awarded the Ludington Award from the Educational Paperback Association for their contribution to children's literature, the Drexel Citation from Drexel University, several Philadelphia Literary Children's Roundtable Honors, and many other state reading association awards.<ref name="psu"> urltoken Jan Berenstain</ref><ref name="Michener"> urltoken name="Drexel"> urltoken Following Jan Berenstain's death in 2012, acclaimed children's author Jerry Spinelli said that "the Berenstains made a wonderful and lasting contribution to children's literature." Author and professor Donna Jo Napoli said, "Those bears have helped so many children through so many kinds of challenges that kids face, in such a cheerful and kind of energetic way."<ref name=philly022812/> The Washington Posts Alexandra Petri wrote that the books were "timeless, timely, and kind-hearted, like all the best literature," and acknowledged the Posts 1989 piece by saying, "This is one of the times the kids have the right idea and Charles Krauthammer does not."<ref>Petri, Alexandra. urltoken "Thank you, Jan Berenstain for the Bears."

==Franchise==
Since the Berenstain Bears' creation, the characters have been widely licensed for a broad array of products. The franchise exploded in size in the 1980s, when King Features began aggressively promoting the Bears to marketers amidst a surge in popularity following a series of animated television specials. As of 1983, the Berenstain Bears had been licensed to approximately 40 companies for more than 150 types of products, with projected annual sales of $50 million.<ref name="kleinfield">Kleinfield, N.

A second TV series, also called The Berenstain Bears, debuted on PBS in 2003. The series was produced by the Canada company Nelvana and consisted of 40 30-minute episodes adapted from the books and also a few new stories as well, similar to the 1985 production.<ref name="shattuck"/><ref name="gillies"/> However, the series are considered separate adaptations and were never aired together. Even though the 2003 series is not a remake but a continuation of the episodes, some characters' personalities changed while other characters no longer appeared. (However, new characters appeared.) The original specials and TV series have a rustic design and interaction with other forest animals, while the Nelvana series completely embraced rural life with slower timing. Additionally, as a Canadian production, due to Canadian laws requiring Nelvana to employ only Canadian writers and artists, the Berenstains' involvement in the program was limited; They sought to exert their influence on some details, according to Stan. "Our bears don't wear shoes, and Papa wouldn't wear his hat in the house.And we try to keep complete, total banality out of the stories."<ref name="shattuck"/> Common practicalities of animation did force some minor costume changes from the books, such as eliminating polka dots and plaids. (This issue also occurred in previous animated series and specials. Only a limited amount of polka dots was allowed in the five specials.)<ref name="gillies"/> The show's theme song is performed by Lee Ann Womack.<ref name="gillies"/>
In 2011, 20 episodes of the Nelvana series were dubbed in the Native American Lakota language and began airing on public television in North and South Dakota under the title Matȟó Waúŋšila Thiwáhe ("The Compassionate Bear Family"). The translated series was a collaboration of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation and the nonprofit Lakota Language Consortium, with Mike Berenstain and Nelvana waiving all licensing fees for the venture. The Berenstain Bears is the first animated series to be translated into a Native American language in the United States.<ref>Zerbisias, Antonia. urltoken "Can dubbing a cartoon help save a language?", Toronto Star, September 23, 2011.</ref><ref> urltoken "Berenstain Bears Reconnect Sioux To Native Language."

The Berenstain Bears is a children's literature franchise created by Stan and Jan Berenstain and continued by their son, Mike Berenstain, who assumed partial authorship in 2002, and full authorship in 2012 following Jan's death. The books feature a family of anthropomorphic grizzly bears who generally learn a moral or safety-related lesson in the course of each story.
Since the 1962 debut of the first Berenstain Bears book, The Big Honey Hunt, the series has grown to over 300 titles, which have sold approximately 260 million copies in 23 languages.<ref name="loviglio">Loviglio, Joann. urltoken "50 Years Along, Berenstain Bears A Family Affair". Associated Press. The Washington Times, January 30, 2011. Retrieved 2013-07-07.</ref> The Berenstain Bears franchise has also expanded well beyond the books, encompassing two television series and a wide variety of other products and licenses. While enjoying decades of popularity and receiving numerous awards, the series has been criticized for its perceived saccharine tone and formulaic storytelling.<ref name="farhi19890903" />
