Emirate of Ajman

==Geography==
Ajman is the smallest of the United Arab Emirates, covering only 260 square kilometres (100 sq mi). The city lies on the coast of the Persian Gulf and is home to some 95% of the emirate's population. In 2010, the population was 262,000, of which 16% was Emirati according to official statistics.<ref></ref>
=== Manama and Masfout ===
As well as the city of Ajman, the emirate also encompasses two landlocked exclaves, Manama and Masfut. Manama is in the plains at the foothills of the Hajjar Mountains some 60&nbsp;km east of Ajman city, while Masfout is in the mountains proper, some 110&nbsp;km south of Ajman City.
The city and main territory of Ajman is bordered to the landward side by Sharjah, while Manama shares borders with Sharjah and Fujairah. Masfout borders Oman, Dubai (the village and exclave of Hatta) and Ras Al Khaimah. Both Manama and Masfout are fertile regions and support widespread agricultural development.
Most of the main emirate's landmass is developed, with extensive suburbs stretching out almost to the E311 arterial road, with light industrial zones and warehousing towards the north east. Ajman's creek has been dredged and walled to form a port area and this is the location for the Ajman Port and the Ajman Free Zone.<ref> urltoken Ajman Free Zone</ref> Ajman has a thriving textile industry, and is home to some 15% of the UAE's manufacturing firms.<ref></ref>
The small areas of sandy desert outside the city support scant seasonal growths of wild grasses and scrub, ghaf trees and occasional date palms.<ref></ref> Acacia and ghaf trees are to be found in abundance in Manama, which has long been established as an agricultural centre. Date palm groves and fruit tree plantations are characteristic of Masfout.

Ajman Police was founded in 1967 and originally housed in Ajman Fort, which was vacated by the Ruler, Sheikh Rashid Bin Humaid Al Nuaimi, in that year. Ajman's legal system is governed by UAE Federal law and the Federal courts.
==Economy==
Ajman's GDP was $4.23 billion in 2012,<ref name=":2"></ref> in which it had a positive trade balance with exports of $1.61 billion and imports of $600 million.<ref></ref>
Ajman's economy is dominated by five sectors, manufacturing; construction; wholesale and retail; real estate and business services and transport, storage and communications. In 2012 these contributed some 82% of total GDP, with manufacturing (37%) and construction (15%) the two largest contributors. The three largest growth sectors in Ajman from 2010 to 2012 were social and personal services, which grew 6.4%, transport, storage and communication, which grew 5.1% and manufacturing, which grew 5%.<ref name=":2" />
Some 78% of overall investment in Ajman in 2012 was concentrated in the real estate and government services, electricity and manufacturing.
Ajman is also home to many businesses and manufacturing concerns such as Amtek Industries, Al Haramain Perfumes and the Gulf Medical University.
The fastest growing trades in the manufacturing sector 2009-2011 were carpentry and paper products, printing and publishing. Overall, the manufacturing sector in Ajman grew 16.3% over this period.<ref name=":3"></ref> The re-exporting of chemicals and plastic products clocked over 100% growth in this same time period.
Major export markets from 2009 to 2011 were represented by the GCC countries (31%) and Asia (27%), while Africa and Asia were the fastest growing export markets over this period. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Iran were the Ajman's principal export trade partners.<ref name=":3" />
Investments in Ajman grew in 2013 by 5% compared to 2012. Exports (including re-export) grew in the second quarter of 2014 by 53%.<ref></ref>
===Ajman Free Zone===
With capacity to accommodate 1500 companies and serving over 1,000 vessels a year, Ajman Port and Ajman Free Zone are major contributors to the emirate's economy. Exporting to over 65 countries, the Free Zone's companies comprise something like 20% of the UAE's overall industrial units, with some 256 industrial companies operating from the zone.<ref></ref>
===Real estate===
Ajman was the first emirate in the UAE to offer 100% freehold to global investors, in 2004. This led to real estate prices rising rapidly, from $11 per square foot and, by 2007, developers had announced projects with a worth of $21.78 billion, some 65,000 units in all.<ref name=":4"></ref> In an emirate with a population of 240,000 the figure was high by any standard and the pace of development was not sustainable, with the global financial crisis intervening to bring development to a sharp halt. With considerable pain from investors in stalled projects, the Ajman Real Estate Regulatory Agency came under considerable pressure.
Work has restarted on a number of projects, including the mixed business, leisure and residential development Ajman One.
===Recent developments===
A development boom followed the opening of Ajman's real estate market to global investors in 2004, with 'true' freehold on offer.<ref name=":4" /> By 2008 the growth of real estate speculation and investment had led to the establishment of a real estate regulator, the Ajman Real Estate Regulatory Agency. Arguably ineffective in the face of the fast-moving and evolutionary gold rush taking place, ARERA had not implemented widespread policies or regulations to curb the overheating market by the time the global financial crisis intervened and brought many developments to a crashing halt. As of 2014, a number of key stalled projects had restarted, marking a more cautious and measured return to the development of the emirate's real estate market, which has recently benefited from offering competitive rentals to nearby Sharjah and Dubai.<ref></ref>
The construction of Ajman International Airport began in the second half of 2008 in the Al Manama area of Ajman. Airport operations were scheduled to begin by 2011, and the airport was expected to host about two million passengers per year. The project stalled but has now been restarted and is projected to be completed by 2018<ref></ref> and will entail an investment of some $575m.<ref name=":5"></ref>
A$25 million marina project is also underway, which will include running tracks and facilities to attract international sporting events and provide a draw for tourism to the emirate.<ref name=":5" />
==Places of interest==
Ajman Fort was formerly the residence of the Ruler of Ajman but turned over to Ajman Police as their barracks in 1967. It was subsequently converted into a museum and houses an eclectic collection of artefacts and exhibitions of traditional life in Ajman.
The Red Fort was built during Sheikh Humaid bin Abdul Aziz Al Nuaimi (1910–1928), and consists of four rooms in two towers. The fort was restored in 1986 and a third tower was added to the two older towers. Gravel and red plaster were used in the construction of the walls of the fort and hence it was named the Red Fort. Sandalwood was used in the beams and supports for the construction of the roofs.<ref></ref>
Manama museum, opened on 2 December 2012, is located in Al Mareer Fort, which was originally built during the reign of Sheikh Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi (1873&nbsp;– 1891). A yard overlooks seven rooms and a well. The fort is surrounded by palm trees irrigated by the old Manama Falaj.<ref></ref>
