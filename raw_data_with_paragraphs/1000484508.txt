==Critical response==
Charles Isherwood, in his review of the 2008 revival for The New York Times called the production "a touching revival", and wrote: "Was another romp through Ms. Henley’s playfully Gothic imagination entirely necessary? Perhaps not. Might regular theatergoers eventually tire of these adorable eccentrics, laughing through their tears and crying themselves back to laughter again? Possibly. Interesting roles for women, on screen or behind it, are hard to come by. The quick return of 'Crimes of the Heart,'. gives another handful of talented women a chance to exercise — and, in the case of Ms. Turner, deepen — their gifts onstage."<ref>Isherwood, Charles. urltoken "Theater Review.
