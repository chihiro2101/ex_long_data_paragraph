The 808 was the first drum machine with which users could program a percussion track from beginning to end, complete with breaks and rolls.<ref name="keyboard">Keyboard (magazine), urltoken Volume 7, Issues 1–6, 1981: "The Roland TR-808 will undoubtedly become the standard for rhythm machines of the future because it does what no rhythm machine of the past has ever done. Not only does the TR-808 allow programming of individual rhythm patterns, it can also program the entire percussion track of a song from beginning to end, complete with breaks, rolls, literally anything you can think of."</ref> It includes volume knobs for each voice, numerous audio outputs, and a DIN sync port (a precursor to MIDI) to synchronize with other devices.<ref name=":15" /> Its three trigger outputs can synchronize with synthesizers and other equipment.<ref></ref>
The 808's sounds do not resemble real percussion,<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":12" /> and have been described as "clicky and hypnotic",<ref name=":12" /> "robotic",<ref name=":8" /> "spacey",<ref name=":5" /> "toy-like" and "futuristic".<ref name=":0" /> Fact described them as a combination of "synth tones and white noise" that resembled "bursts coming from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop" more than a real drum kit.<ref name=":1"></ref> The machine is noted for its powerful bass drum sound, built from a sine oscillator, low-pass filter, and voltage-controlled amplifier.<ref name=":6"></ref> The bass drum decay control allows users to lengthen the sound, creating uniquely low frequencies that flatten slightly over time, possibly not by design.<ref name=":6" /> The New Yorker described the kick drum as the 808's defining feature.<ref name=":8"></ref>
== Release ==
The 808 launched in 1980 with a list price of .<ref name=":1" /> Roland marketed it as an affordable alternative to the Linn LM-1, manufactured by Linn Electronics, which used samples of real drum kits.<ref name=":1" /> The 808 sounded simplistic and synthetic by comparison; electronic music had yet to become mainstream and many musicians and producers wanted realistic-sounding drum machines.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":1" /> Many reports state that one review dismissed the machine as sounding like "marching anteaters", though this was likely referring to machines that predated it.<ref name=":14" /> Keyboard (magazine) wrote a positive review, predicting that it would become "the standard for rhythm machines of the future".<ref name="keyboard"/>
Despite some early adopters,<ref name=":1" /> the 808 was a commercial failure<ref name=":11" /> and fewer than 12,000 units were sold.<ref name=":2"></ref> Roland ended production in 1983<ref name=":0" /> after semiconductor improvements made it impossible to restock the faulty transistors essential to its design.<ref name=":8" />
== Legacy ==
Though the 808 was commercially unsuccessful, it has had a lasting influence on popular music and was eventually used on more hit records than any other drum machine.<ref></ref> Roland credits the first use in a live performance to the Japanese electronic group Yellow Magic Orchestra with "BGM (album)" in 1980.<ref name=":52"></ref><ref></ref> The first records to feature the 808 were released in 1981: Yellow Magic Orchestra's BGM<ref></ref> and the Monitors' "Nobody Told Me".<ref name=":7" /> In 1982, the American R&B artist Marvin Gaye released the first hit single that featured the 808, "Sexual Healing".<ref name=":5" /> Gaye was drawn to the instrument because he could use it to create music without other musicians or producers.<ref name=":8" />
By the time Roland discontinued the 808 in 1983, it had become common on the used market, often selling for under $100.<ref name=":1" /> Its ease of use,<ref name=":12" /> affordability, and idiosyncratic sound earned it a cult following among underground musicians and producers,<ref name=":1" /> and it became a cornerstone of the developing electronic and hip hop genres.<ref name=":5" /> In 1982, Afrika Bambaataa and the Soulsonic Force released their single "Planet Rock", which made extensive use of the 808 to create "strange, futuristic percussion that became hugely popular on dancefloors".<ref name=":9"></ref> The track influenced the development of electronic and hip hop<ref name=":13"></ref> and subgenres including Miami bass and Detroit techno, and popularized the 808 as a "fundamental element of futuristic sound".<ref name=":5" /> According to Slate, "Planet Rock" "didn't so much put the 808 on the map so much as reorient an entire world of post-disco dance music around it".<ref name=":12" />
The 808 was subsequently used by hip hop acts including Run-DMC, LL Cool J, and Public Enemy.<ref name=":8" /> It has been described as hip hop's equivalent to the Fender Stratocaster guitar, which dramatically influenced the development of rock music.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> The 808 bass drum, in particular, became so essential that Hank Shocklee of the Bomb Squad production group declared that "it's not hip hop without that sound".<ref name=":8" /> The New Yorker wrote that the "trembling feeling of the 808 bass drum, booming down boulevards in Oakland, the Bronx, and Detroit, are part of America's cultural DNA".<ref name=":8" /> Even after the 808 fell out of use by East Coast hip hop producers in the 1990s, it remained a staple of southern hip hop.<ref name=":1" />
The 808's limited pattern storage encouraged artists to push its limits; according to Slate, "those eight-bar units became veritable playgrounds for invention and creativity".<ref name=":12" /> Artists manipulated the bass drum to produce new sounds,<ref name=":12" /> such as on the 1984 single "Set it Off", in which producer Strafe used it to imitate the sound of an underground nuclear test.<ref name=":8" /> Producer Rick Rubin popularized the technique of lengthening the bass drum decay and tuning it to different pitches to create basslines.<ref name=":10"></ref> On their 1986 track "Paul Revere", the Beastie Boys reversed a recording of an 808 to produce backwards-sounding percussion.<ref></ref>
The 808 also saw extensive use beyond hip hop, such as on Whitney Houston's 1987 pop hit "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)".<ref></ref> In the 1984 Talking Heads concert film Stop Making Sense, singer David Byrne performs "Psycho Killer" on acoustic guitar accompanied by an 808,<ref></ref> stumbling against its "gunshot"-like sounds.<ref></ref> Songwriter Phil Collins found the machine useful for looping rhythms for long periods, since human drummers would be tempted to add variations and fills.<ref name=":10" /> The New Yorker wrote that "the introduction of Roland's magic box was indisputably the big bang of pop's great age of disruption, from 1983 to 1986. The 808's defiantly inorganic timbres&nbsp;. sketched out the domain of a new world of music."<ref name=":8" />
In the United Kingdom, the 808 was popularized by the electronic group 808 State, which took its name from the machine<ref name=":1" /> and used it extensively. 808 State's Graham Massey said, "The Roland gear began to be a kind of Esperanto in music. The whole world began to be less separated through this technology, and there was a classiness to it—you could transcend your provincial music with this equipment."<ref name=":0" /> With the rise of Rave, a precursor to acid house, the 808 became a staple sound on British radio.<ref name=":5" />
.<ref name=":1" />
The 808 is one of the most influential inventions in popular music.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":10" /> In 2019, DJMag wrote that it is "probably the most used drum machine in the last 40 years".<ref name=":16" /> Samples of its sounds are common in music software, and it has inspired numerous Synthesiser clone.<ref name=":0" /><ref></ref> Flavorwire wrote that "the 808 has become so ubiquitous over the years that its beats are almost a language of their own—you know the sounds even if you have no idea what a drum machine is, and as such, you also notice when somebody messes with them or uses them in unusual contexts".<ref name=":13" /> The New Yorker wrote in 2015 that the 808 was the bedrock of the modern "urban-youth-culture soundtrack", particularly in trap music, and had influenced a new blend of dance and retro hip hop that "embraces and fetishizes&nbsp;. street music from the past".<ref name=":8" /> According to Slate, it was instrumental in pop music's shift from conventional structure and harmonic progression to "thinking in terms of sequences, discrete passages of sound and time to be repeated and revised ad infinitum".<ref name=":12" />
== Successors ==
The 808 was followed in 1983 by the TR-909, the first Roland drum machine to use samples. Like the 808, the 909 was influential on popular music, influencing genres such as techno, house and acid.<ref name=":11" /> 
808 samples were included in ReBirth RB-338, an early software synthesiser developed by Propellerhead Software.<ref name=":17"></ref> According to Andy Jones of MusicTech, ReBirth was "especially incredible as it made the sound of the TR-808 and TB-303, two iconic Roland dance beasts that everyone had tried to recreate in hardware, and here was something doing it… in software?"<ref name=":17" /> ReBirth was retired in 2017 as Roland said it infringed on its intellectual property.<ref name=":17" />
Roland has included 808 samples in several drum machines, including 808 its Groovebox in the 1990s,<ref name=":11" /> the TR-8 in 2014,<ref name=":9" /> and the TR-8S in 2018.<ref></ref> In 2017, Roland released the TR-08, a miniaturized 808 featuring an LED display, MIDI and USB connections, expanded sequencer control, and a built-in speaker.<ref></ref> Roland released the first official software emulations of the 808 and 909 in 2018.<ref></ref>
In 2019, Behringer released an 808 clone, the Behringer RD-8 Rhythm Designer. Unlike Roland's TR-08 and TR-8S, which use samples and virtual synthesis to recreate the 808 sounds, the RD-8 uses analogue circuitry.<ref></ref>

The Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, commonly known as the 808, is a drum machine manufactured by the Roland Corporation between 1980 and 1983. It was one of the first drum machines to allow users to program rhythms instead of using preset patterns. Unlike its nearest competitor at the time, the more expensive Linn LM-1, the 808 generates sounds using analog synthesis rather than playing samples.
Launched when electronic music had yet to become mainstream, the 808 received mixed reviews for its unrealistic drum sounds and was a commercial failure. After building approximately 12,000 units, Roland discontinued the 808 after its semiconductors became impossible to restock. It was succeeded by the TR-909 in 1983. 
Over the course of the 1980s, the 808 attracted a cult following among underground musicians for its affordability on the used market, ease of use, and idiosyncratic sounds, particularly its deep, "booming" bass drum. It became a cornerstone of the emerging electronic, dance, and hip hop genres, popularized by early hits such as "Sexual Healing" by Marvin Gaye and "Planet Rock" by Afrika Bambaataa and the Soulsonic Force.
The 808 was eventually used on more hit records than any other drum machine. Its particular popularity in hip hop has made it one of the most influential inventions in popular music, comparable to the Fender Stratocaster's impact on rock. Its sounds are included with music software and modern drum machines, and it has inspired numerous clones.
