Rabiria gens

==Origin==
The great majority of Rabirii known from inscriptions lived in Italy, and a large family of this name seems to have lived at Tusculum, an ancient city of Latium not far from Rome. Another of the Rabirii bears the cognomen Tiburtinus, indicating that he or his ancestors probably came from Tibur, another city of northern Latium, not far from Rome and Tusculum, and strongly suggesting that the Rabirii were Latins.
==Praenomina==
The chief praenomen of the Rabirii are Gaius and Publius, both of which were among the most common names throughout Roman history. Other praenomina appear sporadically, including Gnaeus, Lucius, Marcus, Numerius, Quintus, and Sextus.
==Members==
* Gaius Rabirius, an elderly senator brought to trial in 63 BC on a charge of perduellio, based on his association with the mob that killed the Tribune of the Plebs Lucius Appuleius Saturninus nearly forty years earlier. Rabirius was defended by Cicero to no avail, but escaped death when the trial was interrupted by Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer.<ref>Cassius Dio, xxxvii. 26–28.</ref><ref>Suetonius, "The Life of Caesar", 12.</ref><ref>Cicero, Pro Rabirio, passim, In Pisonem, 2, De Oratore, 29.</ref>
* Rabiria, sister of the senator Rabirius, married Gaius Curius, a publican, and was the mother of Gaius Rabirius Postumus.
* Gaius Rabirius Postumus, born Gaius Curius, was adopted by his uncle, the senator Gaius Rabirius. He earned his fortune as a money-lender, and his chief client was Ptolemy Auletes, the exiled King of Egypt.

The gens Rabiria was a minor plebs family at Ancient Rome. Although of senatorial rank, few members of this gens appear in history, and the only one known to have held any of the higher offices of the Roman state was Gaius Rabirius Postumus, who was praetor circa 48 or 47 BC.<ref>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, pp. 512 ("Gaius Rabirius Postumus"), 638–640 ("Gaius Rabirius, Rabirius").</ref>
