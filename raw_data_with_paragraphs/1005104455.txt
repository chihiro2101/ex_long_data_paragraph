Hanging

==Methods of judicial hanging==
There are numerous methods of hanging in execution which instigate death either by the fracturing of the spine or by strangulation.
===Short drop===
The short drop is a method of hanging performed by placing the condemned prisoner on a raised support such as a stool, ladder, cart, or other vehicle, with the noose around the neck. The support is then moved away, leaving the person dangling from the rope.<ref name="Hughes2012"></ref><ref name="Potter1965"></ref>
Suspended by the neck, the weight of the body tightens the noose around the neck effecting strangulation and death. This typically takes 10-20 minutes.<ref></ref>
Before 1850, the short drop was the standard method of hanging, and is still common in suicides and extrajudicial hangings (such as lynchings and summary executions) which do not benefit from the specialised equipment and Official Table of Drops used in the newer methods.
==== Pole method ====
A short drop variant is the Austro-Hungarian "pole" method, called Würgegalgen (literally: strangling gallows), in which the following steps take place:
# The condemned is made to stand before a specialized vertical pole or pillar, approximately 3 metres in height.
# A rope is attached around the condemned's feet and routed through a pulley at the base of the pole.
# The condemned is hoisted to the top of the pole by means of a sling running across the chest and under the armpits.
# A narrow-diameter noose is looped around the prisoner's neck, then secured to a hook mounted at the top of the pole.
# The chest sling is released, and the prisoner is rapidly jerked downward by the assistant executioners via the foot rope.
# The executioner stands on a stepped platform approximately 1.2 metres high beside the condemned, and guides the head downward with his hand simultaneous to the efforts of his assistants.<ref name="KHF" /> In some countries the executioner would then manually dislocate the condemned's neck.
This method was later also adopted by the successor states, most notably by Czechoslovakia; where the "pole" method was used as the single type of execution from 1918 until the abolition of capital punishment in 1990. Nazi war criminal Karl Hermann Frank, executed in 1946 in Prague, was among approximately 1,000 condemned people executed in this manner in Czechoslovakia.<ref name="KHF"></ref>
===Standard drop===
The standard drop involves a drop of between and came into use from 1866, when the scientific details were published by an Irish doctor, Samuel Haughton. Its use rapidly spread to English-speaking countries and those where judicial systems had an English origin.
It was considered a humane improvement on the short drop because it was intended to be enough to cervical fracture, causing immediate unconsciousness and rapid brain death.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
This method was used to execute condemned Nazis under United States jurisdiction after the Nuremberg Trials including Joachim von Ribbentrop and Ernst Kaltenbrunner.<ref>Report by Kingsbury Smith, International News Service, 16 October 1946.</ref> In the execution of Ribbentrop, historian Giles MacDonogh records that: "The hangman botched the execution and the rope throttled the former foreign minister for 20 minutes before he expired."<ref>MacDonogh G., "After the Reich" John Murray, London (2008) p. 450.</ref> A Life magazine report on the execution merely says: "The trap fell open and with a sound midway between a rumble and a crash, Ribbentrop disappeared. The rope quivered for a time, then stood tautly straight."<ref>Life Magazine, 28 October 1946: urltoken The Gallows Chamber</ref>
===Long drop===
. The careful placement of the eye or knot of the noose (so that the head was jerked back as the rope tightened) contributed to breaking the neck.
Prior to 1892, the drop was between four and ten feet (about one to three metres), depending on the weight of the body, and was calculated to deliver a force of 1,260 lbf (5,600 newtons or 572 kgf), which fractured the neck at either the 2nd and 3rd or 4th and 5th cervical vertebrae. This force resulted in some decapitations, such as the infamous case of Tom Ketchum in New Mexico Territory in 1901, owing to a significant weight gain while in custody not having been factored into the drop calculations. Between 1892 and 1913, the length of the drop was shortened to avoid decapitation. After 1913, other factors were also taken into account, and the force delivered was reduced to about 1,000&nbsp;lbf (4,400 N or 450 kgf). The decapitation of Eva Dugan during a botched hanging in 1930 led the state of Arizona to switch to the gas chamber as its primary execution method, on the grounds that it was believed more humane.<ref> urltoken "Gruesome death in gas chamber pushes Arizona towards injections", New York Times, 25 April 1992 (retrieved 7 January 2008).</ref> One of the more recent decapitations as a result of the long drop occurred when Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti was hanged in Iraq in 2007.<ref></ref> Accidental decapitation also occurred during the 1962 hanging of Arthur Lucas, one of the last two people to be put to death in Canada.<ref></ref>
Nazis executed under British jurisdiction, including Josef Kramer, Fritz Klein, Irma Grese and Elisabeth Volkenrath, were hanged by Albert Pierrepoint using the variable drop method devised by Marwood. The record speed for a British long drop hanging was 7 seconds from the executioner entering the cell to the drop. Speed was considered to be important in the British system as it reduced the condemned's mental distress.<ref name="isbn0-340-21307-8"></ref>
==As suicide==
Hanging is a common suicide method. The materials necessary for suicide by hanging are readily available to the average person, compared with firearms or poisons. Full suspension is not required, and for this reason, hanging is especially commonplace among suicidal prisoners (see suicide watch). A type of hanging comparable to full suspension hanging may be obtained by self-strangulation using a ligature around the neck and the partial weight of the body (partial suspension) to tighten the ligature. When a suicidal hanging involves partial suspension the deceased is found to have both feet touching the ground, e.g., they are kneeling, crouching or standing. Partial suspension or partial weight-bearing on the ligature is sometimes used, particularly in prisons, mental hospitals or other institutions, where full suspension support is difficult to devise, because high ligature points (e.g., hooks or pipes) have been removed.<ref></ref>
In Canada, hanging is the most common method of suicide,<ref name="cansuicide"></ref> and in the U.S., hanging is the second most common method, after self-inflicted gunshot wounds.<ref></ref> In the United Kingdom, where firearms are less easily available, in 2001 hanging was the most common method among men and the second most commonplace among women (after poisoning).<ref></ref>
Those who survive a suicide-via-hanging attempt, whether due to breakage of the cord or ligature point, or being discovered and cut down, face a range of serious injuries, including cerebral anoxia (which can lead to permanent brain damage), laryngeal fracture, cervical spine fracture (which may cause paralysis), tracheal fracture, pharyngeal laceration, and carotid artery injury.<ref></ref>
==As human sacrifice==
There are some suggestions that the Vikings practiced hanging as human sacrifices to Odin, to honour Odin's own sacrifice of hanging himself from the Yggdrasil.<ref>
==Hanging by the ribs==
In 1713, Juraj Jánošík, a semi-legendary Slovak outlaw and folk hero, was sentenced to be hanged from his left rib. He was left to slowly die.<ref>" urltoken Modern-day 'outlaws' gather to honour Jánošík". The Slovak Spectator. 9 July 2012.</ref>
The German physician Gottlob Schober (1670–1739),<ref></ref> who worked in Russia from 1712, notes that a person could hang from the ribs for about three days prior to expiring, his primary pain being that of extreme thirst. He thought this degree of insensitivity was something peculiar to the Russian mentality.<ref></ref>
The Dutch in Suriname were also in the habit of hanging a slave from the ribs, a custom amongst the African tribes from whom they were originally purchased. John Gabriel Stedman stayed in South America from 1772 to 1777 and described the method as told by a witness:<ref>Stedman, J.G.: " urltoken Narrative, of a five years' expedition", Vol.1, London 1813, p.116</ref>
William Blake was specially commissioned to make illustrations to Stedman's narrative.<ref>Honour, Hugh (1975). The European Vision of America Cleveland, Ohio; The Cleveland Museum of Art, p.343</ref>
==Grammar==
The proper, traditional past tense and past participle form of the verb "hang", in this sense, is (to be) "hanged".<ref>Oxford English Dictionary (2015 update), OUP, Oxford, UK</ref> Some dictionaries list only "hanged",<ref>Online </ref><ref>Online </ref> whereas others show both forms.<ref></ref><ref></ref> For example, "people are hanged; meat is hung".

Hanging is the suspension of a person by a noose or ligature around the neck.<ref name=oed>Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed. Hanging as method of execution is unknown, as method of suicide from 1325.</ref> The Oxford English Dictionary states that hanging in this sense is "specifically to put to death by suspension by the neck", though it formerly also referred to crucifixion and death by impalement in which the body would remain "hanging". Hanging has been a common method of capital punishment since medieval times, and is the primary execution method in numerous countries and regions. The first known account of execution by hanging was in Homer's Odyssey (Book XXII).<ref name=JSpine2011-02/> In this specialised meaning of the common word hang, the past and past participle is hanged instead of hung.
Hanging is a common method of suicide in which a person applies a ligature to the neck and brings about unconsciousness and then death by suspension or partial suspension.
