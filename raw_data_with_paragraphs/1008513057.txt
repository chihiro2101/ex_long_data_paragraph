== Etymology ==
The hydronym Ness is of Pictish origin.<ref name="MacBain"></ref> The name may be derived from *Nessa, the name of a river goddess.<ref name="MacBain" /> *Nessa preserves an Old Celtic *Nesta, with roots in Indo-European ned, "water",<ref name="MacBain" /> from which the Greek hydronyms Neda and Nestos are descended.<ref name="MacBain" />
==Course==
Dochgarroch weir at the downstream end of Loch Dochfour delineates the start of the River Ness. At Carnarc Point on the west bank the river discharges into the eastern end of the Beauly Firth, which is a continuation of the Moray Firth, at Kessock. The northern section of the Caledonian Canal passes partly through the River Ness and partly alongside it.<ref></ref> The river Ness is of glacial origin. Although of short length, the River Ness has one of the highest average discharge rates in the UK of .<ref> urltoken Highland Council Inverness Flooding Report </ref>
==Ness Catchment==
Although the River Ness starts at Dochgarroch weir at the downstream end of Loch Dochfour, it is supplied by Loch Ness, and so all the rivers flowing into Loch Ness are part of the River Ness catchment area:
*River Ness
**River Farigaig (R) (flows into Loch Ness)
**River Enrick (L) (flows into Loch Ness)
**River Coiltie (L) (flows into Loch Ness)
**River Foyers (R) (flows into Loch Ness)
***River Fechlin (L)
***Allt Breineag (L)
***River E (L) (flows into Loch Mhòr)
**River Moriston (L) (flows into Loch Ness)
***Allt Bhlaraidh (L)
***River Doe (L)
***River Loyne (R)
**Allt Doe (R) (flows into Loch Ness)
**River Tarff (R) (flows into Loch Ness)
**River Oich (links Loch Oich to head of Loch Ness at Fort Augustus)
***River Garry, Inverness-shire (flows into Loch Oich)
The linear River Ness-Loch Ness-Loch Oich axis follows the Great Glen Fault, with the watershed being in a low depression at Laggan Locks, beyond which Loch Lochy-River Lochy-River Spean continue on this axis to the west coast at Fort William.
==Notable buildings==
On a hill above the river in Inverness stands Inverness Castle. Next to the castle is the Inverness Museum and Art Gallery. The river is overlooked by the Eden Court Theatre, one of the largest theatres in Scotland. Inverness Cathedral also lies on the banks of the River Ness as does Old High St Stephen's, which stands on a hill known as St Michael's Mount. Inverness draws many tourists and there are hotels along the river.
==Bridges==
There are several bridges in Inverness which cross the River Ness: the Ness Islands bridges; the Infirmary Bridge, built at Rose Street Foundry, Inverness 1879; Ness Bridge, constructed in 1961 replacing an earlier bridge which itself replaced a bridge of 1685<ref> urltoken Act in Favour of Bridge Toll at Inverness 1685, 19th century copy, Am Baile</ref> which collapsed during flooding in 1849. The 1685 bridge was sketched by J. M. W.

==Miscellanea==
The first claimed sighting of the Loch Ness Monster was in the River Ness in AD 565, when Saint Columba is said to have banished a "water monster" back into the river after it tried to attack one of his disciples who was swimming across the river.<ref> urltoken Columba#Vita Columbae written by Adamnan, Ninth Abbot of that Monastery, ed. William Reeves, 1874 Book 2 Chapter 28</ref>
According to Adomnán, when Columba visited King Bridei I of Pictland at his house on the River Ness, he met a wizard named Broichan who had an Irish slave-girl that he refused to release even though Columba pleaded with him. Columba went out of Bridei's house and picked up a white pebble from the river. He said that the pebble would be used to heal many sick people in Pictland, and that Broichan was suffering for his sins at that very moment. After he had finished speaking, two messengers came to tell them that Broichan had a seizure and they wanted Columba to help them. Columba gave them the stone and said to dip it in water to give to Broichan, if he agreed to release the slave-girl. He agreed to do so, and the stone was put in water and it floated on it; the wizard drank from the water and was healed. This stone was kept by King Bridei in the royal treasury for the rest of his life, and anyone who came there for healing would be given water with the stone floating in it, and they would be healed.<ref>Adomnan of Iona.
