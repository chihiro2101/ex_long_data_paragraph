An Extremely Goofy Movie

==Plot==
After Max Goof goes to college with his friends P.J. and Bobby, Goofy's empty nest syndrome causes him to disastrously falter at work, resulting in his dismissal. At the unemployment office, Goofy is told that he needs a college degree to get another job. Max and his friends meet Bradley Uppercrust III, the leader of the Gamma Mu Mu fraternity and a veteran skateboarder. Bradley is impressed by Max's own skateboarding talent and invites him to join the Gammas and take part in the college's X Games. Max declines the offer due to the condition that he cannot bring his friends along. Following a skirmish, the two parties place a bet in which the loser becomes the other group's towel boy. To Max's horror, Goofy begins attending the same college and interrupts the group's down-time with chores. Max decides to distract his father by introducing him to the college librarian, Sylvia Marpole, with whom he has much in common. Goofy accidentally impresses Bradley with his clumsy attempt at skateboarding and is invited to join the Gammas, which he accepts upon Max's encouragement.
During the first qualifiers for the X Games, Bradley discreetly blinds Max with a pocket mirror during his performance and installs a rocket booster on Goofy's skateboard. Goofy beats Max and Max's team barely makes the semi-finals. Eventually, Max lashes out at Goofy, telling him to stay out of his life and storms off in anger. A depressed Goofy fails his first midterm exam and misses a date with Sylvia. Returning home, Goofy is inspired by his neighbor, Pete to regain his focus. Goofy goes back to college and reconciles with Sylvia, who helps him ace the rest of his exams. As Goofy decides to quit the Gammas, he overhears the group plotting to cheat for the semi-finals, but Max, still angry with his father over beating him in the qualifiers, refuses to listen.
At the semi-finals, all teams but Max's and the Gammas' are eliminated. Just before the final triathlon, Bradley eliminates P.J. from the games, leaving Max's team short one player and spurring Max to recruit and apologize to Goofy via the jumbotron. Throughout the race, Bradley and his team attempt to hinder Max's team, but fail. Although Goofy manages to temporarily knock out Bradley with a horseshoe in the final section of the race, his final trick results in Max and Gamma member, Tank, getting trapped underneath the wreckage of a logo. As Bradley passes them by, Max and Goofy rescue Tank, who assists Max in winning the race. Afterwards, Bradley concedes his defeat as Max calls off the bet, but allows a vengeful Tank to advance on Bradley for betraying him, telling him that he is now the current leader of the Gammas before flinging him into the X Games blimp overhead. During graduation day, Max gives Goofy his grand-prize trophy engraved with an affirmation of their bond as an apology gift for his outburst towards him just before Goofy drives off with Sylvia.
==Voice cast==
* Bill Farmer as Goofy. Goofy inconveniences the lives of those around him by accident, but always has the best intentions at heart. He spends most of the movie coming to terms with not being needed as a guardian for Max anymore. Andrew Collins served as the supervising animator for Goofy.
* Jason Marsden as Max. Now 18-years-old and college-bound, his attempts to distance himself from Goofy wind up making things worse for him. By finally accepting Goofy as a major part of his life, he was able to find the independence he long sought. Bob Baxter and Steven Trenbirth served as the supervising animators for Max.
* Jeff Bennett as Bradley Uppercrust III, the leader of the Gamma Mu Mu fraternity and the main antagonist of the film. He is extremely arrogant and proud of his position as head of the fraternity and will do everything he can to keep it that way. Kevin Peaty served as the supervising animator for Bradley. 
** Bennett also voices the Unemployment Lady, Chuck the Sportscaster, Ken Clark (uncredited), a diminutive member of the Gammas (uncredited), and an X-Games referee (uncredited).
* Jim Cummings as Pete, P.J.'s father. Unlike Goofy, Pete is looking forward to rid himself of P.J. According to P.J., Pete intends to turn the latter's room into a bowling alley once he leaves for college.
** Cummings also voices Goofy's boss at Beekins Toy Company (uncredited), a member of the Gammas who wears sunglasses (uncredited), and both a professor and a tour guide at the college (both uncredited).
* Vicki Lewis as the Beret Girl, a charismatic and suave stage performer in the college café called the "Bean Scene". She becomes P.J.'s love interest when the latter shows innate talent in poetry, and supports Max's group in general as they take on the Gammas. Kevin Peaty served as the supervising animator for the Beret Girl.
*Bebe Neuwirth as Sylvia Marpole, the college librarian who immediately becomes Goofy's love interest when she is shown to share Goofy's love for American culture from the 1970s. Andrew Collins served as the supervising animator for Sylvia.
* Rob Paulsen as P.J. Max's best friend since childhood. Unlike Max, P.J. is somewhat woeful about how he never earned his dad's genuine respect but finds confidence after meeting with Beret Girl. Bob Baxter and Steven Trenbirth served as the supervising animators for P.J.
** Paulsen also voices a member of the Gammas with black hair and a big snout (uncredited), and an attendant at the X-Games semifinals (uncredited).
* Pauly Shore as Robert "Bobby" Zimuruski. Max's other best friend. Bob Baxter and Steven Trenbirth served as the supervising animators for Bobby. Unlike the first film, Shore receives credit for his work.
* Brad Garrett as Tank, the second-in-command (later current leader) of the Gammas. Tank is big in stature, towering over the other characters, and serves as a typical muscle man for the Gammas.
Additional voices include Paddi Edwards as a receptionist and Kath Soucie, Jenna von Oÿ (who voiced Stacey in the first film) and Cree Summer as college students.
