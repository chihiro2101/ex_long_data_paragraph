Kenneth Clark

===Later years: 1970–1983===
Clark made a series of six programmes for ITV. They were collectively titled Pioneers of Modern Painting, directed by his son Colin. They were screened in November and December 1971, with a programme on each of Manet, Cezanne, Monet, Seurat, Rousseau, and Munch. Although they were shown on commercial television, there were no advertising breaks during each programme.<ref>"The Week's TV", The Observer, 7 June 1971, p. 26</ref> With the aid of a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC acquired copies of the series and distributed them to colleges and universities throughout the US.<ref> urltoken "National Gallery of Art Distributes New Kenneth Clark Film Series on Modern Painting" , National Gallery of Art, retrieved 27 June 2017</ref>
Five years later, Clark returned to the BBC, presenting five programmes about Rembrandt. The series, directed by Colin Clark, considered various aspects of the painter's work, from his self-portraits to his biblical scenes. The National Gallery observes about this series, "These art history lectures are an authoritative study of Rembrandt and feature examples of his work from over fifty museums".<ref> urltoken "Rembrandt: The Kenneth Clark Lectures" National Gallery, retrieved 27 June 2017</ref>
Clark was chancellor of the University of York from 1967 to 1978 and a trustee of the British Museum.<ref name=dnb/> During his last ten years he wrote thirteen books. As well as some drawn from his researches for his lectures and television series, there were two volumes of memoirs, Another Part of the Wood (1974) and The Other Half (1977). He was known throughout his life for his impenetrable façade and enigmatic character, which were reflected in the two autobiographical books: Piper describes them as "elegantly and subtly polished, at times very moving, often very funny but somewhat distanced, as if about someone else."<ref name=dnb/>
In his last years Clark suffered from arteriosclerosis. He died at the age of seventy-nine in a nursing home in Hythe, Kent, after a fall.<ref name=s398>Stourton, p. 398</ref>
==Family and personal life==
In 1927 Clark married a fellow student, Elizabeth Winifred Martin, known as "Jane" (1902–1976), the daughter of Robert Macgregor Martin, a Dublin businessman, and his wife, Emily Winifred Dickson. The couple had three children: Alan, in 1928, and twins, Colette (known as Celly, pronounced "Kelly") and Colin, in 1932.<ref name=dnb/>
Away from his official duties, Clark enjoyed what he described as "the Great Clark Boom" in the 1930s. He and his wife lived and entertained in considerable style in a large house in Portland Place. In Piper's words, "the Clarks in joint alliance became stars of London high society, intelligentsia, and fashion, from Mayfair to Windsor".<ref name=dnb/>
The Clarks' marriage was devoted but stormy. Clark was a womaniser, and although Jane had love affairs, notably with the composer William Walton, she took some of her husband's extramarital relationships badly.<ref>Lloyd, p. 197</ref> She suffered severe mood swings and later alcoholism and a stroke.<ref>Secrest, p. 217</ref> Clark remained firmly supportive of his wife during her decline.<ref name=dnb/> The Clarks' relations with their three children were sometimes difficult, particularly with their elder son, Alan. He was regarded by his father as a fascist by conviction though also as the ablest member of the Clark family "parents included";<ref>Stourton, pp. 205 and 237</ref> he became a Conservative member of parliament and junior minister, and a celebrated diarist.<ref>Ure, John urltoken "Clark, Alan Kenneth (1928–1999)", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, retrieved 19 June 2017 </ref> The younger son, Colin, became a film-maker, who among other work directed his father in television series in the 1970s.<ref> urltoken "Obituary: Colin Clark" , The Telegraph, 19 December 2002</ref> The twin daughter, Colette, became an official and board member of the Royal Opera House; she outlived her parents and brothers, and was the key source for James Stourton's authorised biography of her father, published in 2016.<ref>Stourton, pp. 253 and 415</ref>
During the war the Clarks lived at Capo Di Monte, a cottage in Hampstead, before moving to the much larger Upper Terrace House nearby.<ref>Cumming, p. 256</ref> They moved in 1953 when Clark bought the Norman castle of Saltwood in Kent, which became the family home.<ref>Secrest, p. 190</ref> In his later years he passed the castle to his elder son, moving to a purpose-built house in the grounds.<ref>Secrest, p. 235</ref> 
Jane Clark died in 1976. Her death was expected, but left Clark devastated. Several of his female friends hoped that he would marry them. His closest female friend, across many years, was Janet Stone, wife of the engraver Reynolds Stone; in common with Clark's daughter and sons, she was dismayed when he announced his intention to marry Nolwen de Janzé-Rice (1924–1989), daughter of Frederic and Alice de Janzé.<ref name=s388>Stourton, pp. 388–390</ref> The family felt that Clark was acting precipitately in marrying someone he had not known well for very long, but the wedding took place in November 1977.<ref name=s388/> Clark and his second wife remained together until his death.<ref name=s398/>
===Beliefs===
Clark's political views were moderately left-of centre; he was a lifelong Labour voter.<ref name=beard/> This was consistent with his upbringing, despite the family wealth: his parents were Liberal in outlook, and Ruskin's social and political views influenced the young Clark.<ref>Secrest, p. 11; and Stourton pp. 5 and 10</ref> His religious outlook was unconventional, but he believed in the divine, rejected atheism, and found the Church of England too secular in its outlook.<ref>Stourton, pp. 304–305</ref> Shortly before his death he was received into the Roman Catholic Church.<ref name=convert/><ref>"Memorial services: Lord Clark, OM, CH", The Times, 14 October 1983, p. 14</ref>

===Reputation===
In 2014 Tate held the "Kenneth Clark: Looking for Civilisation" exhibition, highlighting Clark's impact "as one of the most influential figures in British art of the twentieth century". The exhibition, drawing on works from Clark's personal collection and many other sources, examined his role as "a patron and collector, art historian, public servant and broadcaster&nbsp;. bringing art in the twentieth century to a more popular audience".<ref name=tate> urltoken "Kenneth Clark – Looking for Civilisation" , The Tate, retrieved 27 June 2917</ref> The BBC called him "arguably the most influential figure in 20th century British art".<ref> urltoken "BBC celebrates Sir Kenneth Clark and his iconic series Civilisation" , BBC, retrieved 28 June 2017</ref>
Clark knew that his broadly traditional view of art would be anathema to the Marxist element in the artistic world, and was unsurprised when he was attacked by younger critics, notably John Berger, in the 1970s.<ref name=h16/> Clark's reputation among critics in the twenty-first century is higher for his books and television series than for his consistency as a collector. At the time of the Tate celebration of Clark in 2014, the critic Richard Dorment commented that both in his public and private capacity Clark made many fine purchases but also many errors. In addition to the Previtali Scenes from Tebaldeo's Eclogues, Dorment lists works misattributed by Clark to Michelangelo, Pontormo, Elsheimer and Claude, and a Seurat and a Corot that were genuine but poor examples of the artists' work.<ref name=dtel/> Other critics agreed with the conclusion that Clark's most lasting achievements were as a writer and populariser.
Among his books is "the best introduction to the art of Leonardo da Vinci ever written".<ref name=dtel/> Piper singles out, in addition to the Leonardo monograph, Clark's Piero della Francesca (1951), The Nude (1956, based on his Mellon lectures in Washington in 1953), and Rembrandt and the Italian Renaissance (1966 from his Wrightsman lectures in New York).<ref name=dnb/> The critic Jackie Wullschlager wrote in 2014 that it was as a writer rather than a collector that Clark excelled: "unrivalled since Ruskin for lucidity, erudition, moral conviction".<ref>Wullschlager, Jackie. "A Question of Taste", The Financial Times, 24 May 2014, p. 13</ref> James Hall, in The Guardian, expressed a similar view, calling Clark "the most seductive writer on art since Ruskin and Pater&nbsp;. Today, when most art historians write as joylessly as lawyers and accountants, such verve is sorely needed."<ref>Hall, James. urltoken "Kenneth Clark: arrogant snob or saviour of art?" , The Guardian, 16 May 2014</ref>

Civilisation attracted unprecedented viewing figures for a high art series: 2.5 million viewers in Britain and 5 million in the US.<ref name=h16/> Clark's accompanying book has never been out of print, and the BBC continued to sell thousands of copies of the DVD set of Civilisation every year.<ref>Stourton, p. 452</ref> In 2016, The New Yorker echoed the words of John Betjeman, describing Clark as "the man who made the best telly you’ve ever seen".<ref name=ny>Meis, Morgan. urltoken "The Seductive Enthusiasm of Kenneth Clark’s Civilisation" , The New Yorker, 21 December 2016</ref>
The British Film Institute notes how Civilisation changed the shape of cultural television, setting the standard for later documentary series, from Alastair Cooke's America (1972) and Jacob Bronowski's The Ascent of Man (1973) to the present day.<ref name=bfi/>
