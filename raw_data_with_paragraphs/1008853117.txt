Echinacea species are herbaceous, drought-tolerant perennial plants growing up to 140&nbsp;cm or 4 feet,<ref>32</ref> in height. They grow from taproots, except E. purpurea, which grows from a short caudex with fibrous roots. They have erect stems that in most species are unbranched. Both the basal and cauline (stem) leaves are arranged alternately. The leaves are normally hairy with a rough texture, having uniseriate trichomes (1–4 rings of cells) but sometimes they lack hairs. The basal leaves and the lower stem leaves have petioles, and as the leaves progress up the stem the petioles often decrease in length. The leaf blades in different species may have one, three or five nerves. Some species have linear to Leaf shape leaves, and others have Leaf shape; often the leaves decrease in size as they progress up the stems. Leaf bases gradually increase in width away from the petioles or the bases are Leaf shape. Most species have leaf margins that are entire, but sometimes they are Leaf shape.
The flowers are collected together into single rounded heads at the ends of long peduncles. The inflorescences have crateriform to hemispheric shaped involucres which are 12–40&nbsp;mm wide. The phyllary, or bracts below the flower head, are persistent and number 15–50. The phyllaries are produced in a 2–4 series. The receptacles are hemispheric to conic. The paleae (chaffs on the receptacles of many Asteraceae) have orange to reddish purple ends, and are longer than the disc corollas. The paleae bases partially surrounding the cypselae, and are keeled with the apices abruptly constricted to awn-like tips. The ray florets number 8–21 and the Petal are dark purple to pale pink, white, or yellow. The tubes of the corolla are hairless or sparsely hairy, and the Leaf are spreading, reflexed, or drooping in habit and Leaf shape. The abaxial faces of the Leaf are glabrous or moderately hairy. The flower heads have typically 200–300 fertile, bisexual disc florets but some have more. The Petal are pinkish, greenish, reddish-purple or yellow and have tubes shorter than the throats. The pollen is normally yellow in most species, but usually white in E. pallida. The three or four-angled fruits (cypselae), are tan or bicolored with a dark brown band distally. The pappi are persistent and variously crown-shaped with 0 to 4 or more prominent teeth. x = 11.<ref></ref>
Like all Asteraceae, the flowering structure is a composite inflorescence, with rose-colored (rarely yellow or white) flower arranged in a prominent, somewhat cone-shaped head – "cone-shaped" because the petals of the outer ray florets tend to point downward (are reflexed) once the flower head opens, thus forming a cone. Plants are generally long lived, with distinctive flowers. The common name "cone flower" comes from the characteristic center "cone" at the center of the flower head. The generic name Echinacea is rooted in the Greek word ἐχῖνος (echinos), meaning hedgehog,<ref></ref> in reference to the spiky appearance and feel of the flower heads.
==Species==
DNA analysis is applied to determine the number of Echinacea species, allowing clear distinctions among species based on chemical differences in root metabolites.<ref> urltoken Perry, Ann. 2010. Exploring Echinacea’s Enigmatic Origins. United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service</ref> The research concluded that of the 40 genetically diverse populations of Echinacea studied, there were ten distinct species.

==Research==
Echinacea products vary widely in composition.<ref name="NIH fact sheet"></ref> They contain different species (E. purpurea, E. angustifolia, E. pallida), different plant segments (roots, flowers, extracts), different preparations (extracts and expressed juice), and different chemical compositions which complicate understanding of a potential effect.<ref></ref><ref name="Hart & Dey"/>
Well-controlled clinical trials are limited and low in quality.<ref name="Hart & Dey"/><ref name=Kar2014/> Although there are multiple scientific reviews and meta-analysis published on the supposed immunological effects of Echinacea, there are significant variability of products used among studies leading to limited conclusions about effects and safety. Consequently, regulatory authorities such as the United States Food and Drug Administration have not approved echinacea safe and effective for any health or medical purposes.<ref name=NIH-NCCIH /><ref name="Hart & Dey"></ref>
===Common cold===
While one 2014 systematic review found that Echinacea products are not effective to treat or prevent the common cold,<ref name=Kar2014></ref> a 2016 meta-analysis found tentative evidence that use of Echinacea extracts reduced the risk of repeated respiratory infections.<ref></ref> A 2015 monograph by the European Medicines Agency stated that oral consumption of "expressed juice" or dried expressed juice of Echinacea could prevent or reduce symptoms of a common cold at its onset.<ref name="ema"></ref> As of 2017, the benefit, if any, appears to be small and thus of little utility.<ref name=NIH2017Aug></ref>
===Cancer===
According to Cancer Research UK, "There is no scientific evidence to show that echinacea can help treat, prevent or cure cancer in any way. Some therapists have claimed that echinacea can help relieve side effects from cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but this has not been proven either."<ref name="cancer-uk"></ref>
===COVID-19===
Based on in-vitro studies, extracts of E. purpurea (Echinaforce®) showed virucidal activity against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Because existing data is solely derived from cell cultures, and antiviral effects in humans have not been elucidated, regulatory agencies have not recommended the use of Echinacea preparations for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19.<ref> urltoken "Echinacea als vermeintliches Mittel gegen das neue Coronavirus" swissmedic.ch. Retrieved 18 September 2020.</ref>
==Side effects==
When taken by mouth, Echinacea does not usually cause side effects,<ref name="NIH-NCCIH"></ref> but may have undesirable interactions with various drugs prescribed for diseases, such as heart disease, bleeding, and autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or psoriasis.<ref name=Mayo/><ref name="drugs"></ref> Although there are no specific case reports of drug interactions with Echinacea,<ref name="pmid19719333"></ref> safety about taking Echinacea supplements is not well-understood, with possibilities that it may cause side effects, such as nausea, stomach upset or diarrhea, and that it may have adverse reactions with other medications.<ref name=Mayo/> One of the most extensive and systematic studies to review the safety of Echinacea products concluded that overall, "adverse events are rare, mild and reversible," with the most common symptoms being "gastrointestinal and skin-related."<ref name="Huntley"></ref> Such side effects include nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, itch, and rash.<ref name=drugs/> Echinacea has also been linked to allergic reactions, including asthma, shortness of breath, and one case of anaphylaxis.<ref name=Huntley/><ref></ref><ref name="Ang-Lee"></ref> Muscle and joint pain has been associated with Echinacea, but it may have been caused by cold or flu symptoms for which the Echinacea products were administered.<ref name="Huntley"/> There are isolated case reports of rare and idiosyncratic reactions including thrombocytopenic purpura, leucopenia, hepatitis, kidney failure, and atrial fibrillation, although it is not clear that these were due to Echinacea itself.<ref name="Mayo"></ref> Up to 58 drugs or supplements may interact with Echinacea.<ref name=drugs/>
As a matter of manufacturing safety, one investigation by an independent-consumer testing laboratory found that five of eleven selected retail Echinacea products failed quality testing. Four of the failing products contained levels of phenols below the potency level stated on the labels. One failing product was contaminated with lead.<ref name=consumerlab/>
===Children under 12 years old===
The European Herbal Medicinal Products Committee (HMPC) and the UK Herbal Medicines Advisory Committee (HMAC) recommended against the use of Echinacea-containing products in children under the age of 12. Manufacturers re-labelled all oral Echinacea products that had product licenses for children with a warning that they should not be given to children under 12 as a precautionary measure.<ref name="MHRA UK press release"></ref>
===Pregnancy===
Although research has not found increased risk of birth defects associated with use of Echinacea during the first trimester, it is recommended that pregnant women should avoid Echinacea products until stronger safety supporting evidence becomes available.<ref name=Mayo/>
===Lactation===
It is recommended that women breastfeeding should use caution with Echinacea products due to insufficient safety information available.<ref name=Mayo/>
===General precaution===
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends precaution about using dietary supplements because some products may not be risk free under certain circumstances or may interact with prescription and over-the-counter medicines.<ref name="FDA tips for supplement users"></ref>
As with any herbal preparation, individual doses of Echinacea may vary significantly in chemical composition.<ref name=NIH-NCCIH/> Inconsistent process control in manufactured echinacea products may involve poor inter- and intra-batch homogeneity, species or plant part differences, variable extraction methods, and contamination or adulteration with other products, leading to potential for substantial product variability.<ref name=Kar2014/><ref name=consumerlab></ref>
==Other uses==
Some species of Echinacea, notably E. purpurea, E. angustifolia, and E. pallida, are grown as ornamental plants in gardens.<ref> urltoken "A Comprehensive Echinacea Germplasm Collection Located at the North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station", USDA</ref> Many cultivars exist, and many of them are asexually propagated to keep them true to type.
Echinacea extracts inhibited growth of three species of trypanosomatids: Leishmania donovani, Leishmania major, and Trypanosoma brucei.<ref></ref>
==History==
Echinacea angustifolia was widely used by the North American indigenous peoples as folk medicine.<ref></ref> According to Wallace Sampson, its modern use for the common cold began when a Swiss herbal supplement maker was told that Echinacea was used for cold prevention by Native American tribes who lived in the area of South Dakota.<ref name="WebMD"> urltoken Study: Echinacea Cuts Colds by Half WebMD Health News, June 26, 2007</ref> Some Plains tribes did use echinacea for cold symptoms. The Kiowa used it for coughs and sore throats, the Cheyenne for sore throats, the Pawnee for headaches, and many tribes including the Lakota used it as a analgesic.<ref></ref>

Echinacea <ref>Sunset Western Garden Book, 1995:606–607</ref> is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants in the Asteraceae. It has ten species, which are commonly called coneflowers. They are found only in eastern and central North America, where they grow in moist to dry prairies and open wooded areas. They have large, showy heads of composite flowers, blooming in summer. The generic name is derived from the Greek word , meaning "sea urchin", due to the spiny central disk. These flowering plants and their parts have different uses. Some species are cultivated in gardens for their showy flowers. Echinacea purpurea is used in traditional medicine.<ref name=NIH-NCCIH /> Two of the species, E. tennesseensis and E. laevigata, are listed in the United States as endangered species.<ref name="Conservation status of Echinacea"></ref>
