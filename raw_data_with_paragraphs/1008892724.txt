Montgomery bus boycott

===Victory===
Pressure increased across the country. The related civil suit was heard in federal district court and, on June 5, 1956, the court ruled in Browder v. Gayle (1956) that Alabama's racial segregation laws for buses were unconstitutional.<ref></ref> As the state appealed the decision, the boycott continued. The case moved on to the United States Supreme Court. On November 13, 1956, the Supreme Court upheld the district court's ruling.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
The bus boycott officially ended December 20, 1956, after 381 days. The Montgomery bus boycott resounded far beyond the desegregation of public buses. It stimulated activism and participation from the South in the national Civil Rights Movement and gave King national attention as a rising leader.<ref name="381 Days"></ref><ref>Wright, H.

== Aftermath ==
White backlash against the court victory was quick, brutal, and, in the short-term, effective.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Two days after the inauguration of desegregated seating, someone fired a shotgun through the front door of Martin Luther King's home. A day later, on Christmas Eve, white men attacked a black teenager as she exited a bus. Four days after that, two buses were fired upon by snipers. In one sniper incident, a pregnant woman was shot in both legs. On January 10, 1957, bombs destroyed five black churches and the home of Reverend Robert Graetz, one of the few white Montgomerians who had publicly sided with the MIA.<ref></ref><ref name="udayton999"></ref>
The City suspended bus service for several weeks on account of the violence. According to legal historian Randall Kennedy, "When the violence subsided and service was restored, many black Montgomerians enjoyed their newly recognized right only abstractly . In practically every other setting, Montgomery remained overwhelmingly segregated ."<ref name="udayton999"/> On January 23, a group of Klansmen (who would later be charged for the bombings) lynched a black man, Willie Edwards, on the pretext that he was dating a white woman.<ref></ref>
The city's elite moved to strengthen segregation in other areas, and in March 1957 passed an ordinance making it "unlawful for white and colored persons to play together, or, in company with each other . in any game of cards, dice, dominoes, checkers, pool, billiards, softball, basketball, baseball, football, golf, track, and at swimming pools, beaches, lakes or ponds or any other game or games or athletic contests, either indoors or outdoors."<ref name="udayton999"/>
Later in the year, Montgomery police charged seven Klansmen with the bombings, but all of the defendants were acquitted. About the same time, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled against Martin Luther King's appeal of his "illegal boycott" conviction.<ref></ref> Rosa Parks left Montgomery due to death threats and employment blacklisting.<ref></ref> According to Charles Silberman, "by 1963, most Negroes in Montgomery had returned to the old custom of riding in the back of the bus."<ref></ref>
The National Memorial for Peace and Justice contains, among other things, a sculpture "dedicated to the women who sustained the Montgomery Bus Boycott", by Dana King, to help illustrate the civil rights period.<ref name=inside></ref> The memorial opened in downtown Montgomery, Alabama on April 26, 2018.<ref name=EJI></ref><ref></ref>

King and 88 other boycott leaders and carpool drivers were indicted<ref></ref> for conspiring to interfere with a business under a 1921 ordinance.<ref></ref> Rather than wait to be arrested, they turned themselves in as an act of defiance.
King was ordered to pay a $500 fine or serve 386 days in jail. He ended up spending two weeks in jail. The move backfired by bringing national attention to the protest. King commented on the arrest by saying: "I was proud of my crime. It was the crime of joining my people in a nonviolent protest against injustice."<ref></ref>
Also important during the bus boycott were grass-roots activist groups that helped to catalyze both fund-raising and morale. Groups such as the Georgia Gilmore helped to sustain the boycott by finding new ways of raising money and offering support to boycott participants.<ref></ref> Many members of these organizations were women and their contributions to the effort have been described by some as essential to the success of the bus boycott.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
