Mausoleum of Genghis Khan

===Present-day mausoleum===
Ejin Horo fell to the Communists at the end of 1949 and was controlled by their Northwest Bureau until the establishment of Suiyuan Province the next year.<ref name=bayer1o/> The district's Communists set up rituals honouring Genghis Khan in the early 1950s, but abolished the traditional religious offices surrounding them like the Jinong and controlled the cult through local committees with loyal Party cadres.<ref name=bayer1o/> Without the relics, they relied largely on singing and dancing groups.<ref name=bayer1o/> In 1953, the PRC's central government approved the recently-formed Inner Mongolian provincial government's request for 800,000 to create the present permanent structures.<ref name=bi/> Early the next year,<ref name=bayer12/> the central government permitted the return of the objects at Kumbum to the site being constructed at Ejin Horo.<ref name=bayer1o/> The region's chairman Ulanhu officiated at the first ritual after their return, decrying the Nationalists for having "stolen" them.<ref name=bayer1o/> After this ritual, he immediately held a second ceremony to break ground on a permanent temple to house the objects and the khan's cult, again approved and paid for by China's central government.<ref name=bayer1o/> By 1956, this new temple was completed, greatly expanding the purview of the original shrine.<ref name=bayer11/> Rather than having eight separate shrines throughout Ejin Horo for the Great Khan, his wives, and his children, all were placed together; a further 20 sacred and venerated objects from around the Ordos were also brought to the new site.<ref name=bayer11/> The government also mandated that the main ritual would be held in the summer rather than in the third lunar month, in order to make it more convenient for the headers to maintain their spring work schedules.<ref name=bayer11/> With the Darkhads no longer liable for personally paying for maintenance of the shrine, most accepted these changes.<ref name=bayer11/> An especially large celebration was held in 1962 to mark the 800th anniversary of Genghis Khan's birth.<ref name=bayer12/>
In 1968, the Cultural Revolution's Red Guards destroyed almost everything of value at the shrine.<ref name=bayer11/> For 10 years, the buildings themselves were turned into a salt depot as part of preparations for a potential war with the Soviet Union.
Following Deng Xiaoping's Opening Up Policy, the site was restored by 1982<ref name=bi/> and sanctioned for "Chinese nationalism"<ref name=bayer11/> as a AAAA-rated tourist attraction.<ref name=bi/> Replicas of the former relics were made, and a great marble statue of Genghis was completed in 1989. Priests at the museum now claim that all of the Red Guards who desecrated the tomb have died in abnormal ways, suffering a kind of curse.
Inner Mongolians continued to complain about the poor state of the mausoleum. A 2001 proposal for its refurbishment was finally approved in 2004. Unrelated houses, stores, and hotels were removed from the area of the mausoleum to a separate area away and replaced with new structures in the same style as the mausoleum. The 150-million- (about $20 million) improvement plan was carried out from 2005 to 2006, improving the site's infrastructure, expanding its courtyard, and decorating and repairing its existing buildings and walls. The China National Tourism Administration named the site a AAAAA-rated tourist attraction in 2011.<ref name=2018aaaaa>. </ref>
On 10 July 2015, 20 tourists aged 33 to 74—10 South Africans, 9 Britons, and an Indian—were detained at Ordos Ejin Horo Airport, arrested on terrorism-related charges the next day, and ultimately deported from China after they watched a BBC documentary about Genghis Khan in their hotel rooms prior to visiting the mausoleum. Authorities had considered it "watching and spreading violent terrorist videos".
In 2017, the Genghis Khan Mausoleum averaged about 8000 visitors a day during its peak season and about 200 visitors a day at other times.
==Administration==
The site is overseen by the Genghis Khan Mausoleum Administration Bureau.<ref name=bayerg7/> It was headed by Chageder and then Mengkeduren in the early 2000s.

The present Genghis Khan Mausoleum Scenic Area stretches about , covering about in total.<ref name=bayerg7>.</ref> It consists of the Sulede Altar, the Sightseeing District for the Protection of Historic Relics, the Conservation District for Ecosystem Preservation, the Development-Restricted District of Visual Spectacles, the long Sacred Pathway of Genghis Khan between the entrance and the cenotaph, the long scenic pathway around the Bayinchanghuo Prairie, a Tourist Activity Centre, a Tourist Education Centre, the Sacrificial Sightseeing District, the Mongolian Folk Custom Village, the Shenquan Ecological Tourism Region, the Nadam Equestrian Sport Centre, and the Hot Air Balloon Club.
The tomb complex consists of the Main Hall, the Imperial Burial Palace, the Western Hall, the Eastern Hall, the Western Corridor, and the Eastern Corridor.
The Main Hall (正殿) is octagonal, high,<ref name=bi/> and covers about .<ref name=bi/> It is shaped like a flying eagle as a symbol of the khan's bravery and adventurousness.<ref name=bi/> Its plaque, reading "Mausoleum of Genghis Khan", was written by Ulanhu in 1985.<ref name=bi/> The site includes a high statue of Genghis Khan and two murals about his life, including a wall map of the extent of the Mongol Empire.
The Imperial Burial Palace (寢宮) or Back Palace (後殿) is high and covers about . It has three yurts with yellow silk roofs; the central yurt houses the coffins of Genghis Khan and one of his four<ref name=bi>.</ref> wives and the side yurts house the coffins of his brothers. Genghis Khan's coffin is silver decorated with engraved roses and a golden lock; weapons allegedly used by Genghis lie around it. There are also two other coffins for another two of his consorts. The site's main altar lies in front of this yurt. The cenotaph and its placement are highly unusual in China, which usually follows Han principles like feng shui in the placement of tombs, employing mountains, rivers, and forests in the belief that this increases its spiritual power.
The Eastern Hall or Palace (東殿) is high. It holds the coffin of Tolui (Genghis Khan's 4th and favourite son) and his wife Sorghaghtani.
The Western Hall or Palace (西殿) is high. It holds nine banners with holy arrows thought to house or connect with the soul of the Great Khan. They also represent 9 of Genghis's generals. It also holds Genghis's saddle and reins,<ref name=bi/> some weapons, and some other objects like the khan's milk barrel.<ref name=bi/> All of the items currently displayed are replicas.
The high Eastern (東廊) and Western Corridors (西廊) connecting these halls are decorated with of murals about the lives of Genghis Khan and his descendants.
The site uses a five-colour scheme of blue, red, white, gold, and green to represent the multiethnic nature of Genghis Khan's empire and also the sky, sun and fire, milk, earth, and prairie.<ref name=bi/>

The mausoleum is guarded by the Darkhad or Darqads<ref name=bayero9/> ("Untouchables"), who also oversee its religious festivals, stop tourists from taking photographs, keep candles lit, and watch over the site's keys and books.
