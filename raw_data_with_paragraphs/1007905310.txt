This is a list of minerals for which there are articles on Wikipedia. 
Minerals are distinguished by various chemical and physical properties. Differences in chemical composition and crystal structure distinguish the various species. Within a mineral species there may be variation in physical properties or minor amounts of impurities that are recognized by mineralogists or wider society as a mineral variety. 
Mineral variety names are listed after the valid minerals for each letter.
For a more complete listing of all mineral names, see List of minerals approved by IMA.
