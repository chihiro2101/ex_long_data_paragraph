Terminator (franchise)

==Setting==
The central theme of the franchise is the battle for survival between the nearly-extinct human race and the world-spanning synthetic intelligence that is Skynet. Skynet is positioned in the first film, The Terminator (1984), as a U.S. strategic "Global Digital Defense Network" computer system by Cyberdyne Systems which becomes self-aware. Shortly after activation, Skynet perceives all humans as a threat to its existence and formulates a plan to systematically wipe out humanity itself. The system initiates a nuclear first strike against Russia, thereby ensuring a devastating second strike and a nuclear holocaust which wipes out much of humanity in the resulting nuclear war. In the post-apocalyptic aftermath, Skynet later builds up its own autonomous machine-based military capability which includes the Terminators used against individual human targets and therefore proceeds to wage a persistent total war against the surviving elements of humanity, some of whom have militarily organized themselves into a Resistance. At some point in this future, Skynet develops the ability of time travel, and both it and the Resistance seek to use this technology in order to win the war; either by altering or accelerating past events, or by preventing the apocalyptic timeline.

==Canceled projects==
===Terminator Salvation trilogy===
On May 9, 2007, it was announced that production rights to the Terminator series had passed from the feuding of Andrew G. Vajna and Mario Kassar to The Halcyon Company. The producers of the company hoped to start a new trilogy based on the franchise.<ref></ref> However, due to the box office failure of the fourth film and legal troubles, the Salvation trilogy was ultimately cancelled. William Wisher, who co-wrote the first two films, had written material for a potential Terminator 5 and Terminator 6 that would follow on from the events of Terminator Salvation. The two-part story would involve an element of time travel that brings back the deceased character of Sarah Connor, allowing her to interact with Kyle Reese beyond their initial meeting in the first film. Schwarzenegger would also reprise his role for the sixth film. The films would also include new Terminator villains from Skynet. Wisher had written a 24-page film treatment for Terminator 5 and a four-page concept outline for Terminator 6.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
===Terminator Genisys trilogy===
By December 2013, there were plans for Terminator Genisys to be the start of a new trilogy of films.<ref name=THR></ref><ref></ref> In September 2014, Paramount announced release dates for the two Genisys sequels: May 19, 2017 and June 29, 2018.<ref name=Deadline2014></ref> Terminator Genisys producer David Ellison described the film and its intended trilogy as standalone projects based on Cameron's original Terminator films. Ellison said Terminator Genisys is neither a sequel or a prequel to the previous films, saying "For us this is Terminator 1, this is not Terminator 5".<ref name=io9></ref> The sequels to Genisys were tentatively known as Terminator 2 and Terminator 3.<ref name=io9/><ref name=Deadline2014/><ref name=THR2016/> The two sequels were to be filmed back to back during nine months of continuous shooting.<ref name=SlashVisit></ref>
The storylines for the two sequels were devised by Genisys writers Kalogridis and Lussier.<ref></ref><ref name=io9/> The trilogy was being planned out before Terminator Genisys began filming, as producers David Ellison and Dana Goldberg wanted the full storyline finished ahead of time rather than having to "figure it out as you go along," stating, "We spent a lot of time breaking that down, and we do know what the last line of the third movie is, should we be lucky enough to get to make it."<ref name=Sciretta></ref> Production on the sequels was contingent on whether Terminator Genisys would be successful;<ref name=Sciretta/> development of the trilogy stalled in 2015 after the film's disappointing box-office performance.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> The planned sequels were ultimately cancelled,<ref name=Slash/> with Terminator 2 being removed from Paramount's release schedule in January 2016.<ref name=THR2016></ref>
The new trilogy would have explained who sent Pops back in time to protect Sarah Connor.<ref name=Verge></ref> In February 2015, Schwarzenegger said he would reprise his role as Pops for the second film in the trilogy, with filming set to begin in 2016.<ref></ref> Jai Courtney and Matt Smith would also reprise their respective roles as Kyle Reese and Skynet.<ref></ref><ref></ref> J. K. Simmons would have had further involvement in the new trilogy,<ref name=Verge/> and Dayo Okeniyi would have a significant role reprising his character Danny Dyson in the second film,<ref name=Verge/><ref name=SlashVisit/> which would have focused on John Connor's life after becoming part machine. Jason Clarke said about the cancelled Genisys sequel:<ref name=Slash></ref>
===Terminator Genisys-connected television series===
By December 2013, Skydance Productions and Annapurna Pictures were developing a new Terminator television series. Ashley Miller and Zack Stentz, who had worked together previously on Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, were named as writers and executive producers. The series was said to deviate from the franchise's history at a critical moment in 1984's The Terminator, and would also integrate with the then-projected film series' direct sequels to Terminator Genisys.<ref name=THR/><ref name=Sciretta/><ref></ref>
===Terminator: Dark Fate trilogy===
Plans for a new Terminator film trilogy were announced in July 2017.<ref></ref> While working on the story for Terminator: Dark Fate that year, Cameron and the writers envisioned the film as the first in the new trilogy. They also worked out the basic storylines for each planned film.<ref name=Deadline></ref><ref name=Chitwood></ref><ref></ref><ref name=IGN/>
In October 2019, Cameron said that sequels to Terminator: Dark Fate would further explore the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence, while stating that a resolution between the two feuding sides would be the ultimate outcome.<ref name="IGN"></ref><ref></ref> That month, Schwarzenegger said that Cameron would write the Terminator: Dark Fate sequels, and that Cameron would begin work on the next film in early 2020, for release in 2022.<ref></ref>
Although the events of Terminator: Dark Fate erase Schwarzenegger's T-800 character from existence, Cameron did not rule out the possibility of Schwarzenegger reprising the character: "Look, if we make a shit ton of money with this film Terminator: Dark Fate and the cards say that they like Arnold, I think Arnold can come back. I'm a writer. I can think of scenarios. We don't have a plan for that right now, let me put it that way."<ref></ref> Natalia Reyes was to reprise her role for a sequel.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Hamilton said in October 2019 that she would probably reprise her role as well,<ref></ref> although she joked that she would fake her own death to avoid appearing in it, saying that making Terminator: Dark Fate "really was hard" because of the physical training she had to undergo.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Hamilton later said that she would be happy not to star in another Terminator film, but she kept the possibility open, with a potential exception being that a sequel be done on a smaller scale and budget.<ref></ref>
Dark Fate director Tim Miller said in November 2019 that he did not expect to return for a sequel.<ref></ref> Production of a sequel was contingent on whether Dark Fate was a box-office success.<ref></ref> Following the underwhelming performance of Dark Fate at the box-office (with an estimated loss of at least $120 million), sources close to Skydance told The Hollywood Reporter that there are no plans for further films, effectively cancelling the planned Dark Fate trilogy.<ref></ref>
