East Turkestan

==History==
===Pre-20th century===
In China, the term Western Regions ; Uyghur: Qurighar, Қуриғар) referred to the regions west of the Yumen Pass and more specifically the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang that had come under the Han dynasty's control since 60 BC. Since the Han, successive Chinese governments had to deal with secessionist movements and local rebellions from different peoples in the region.<ref name="Rumer"/> However, even when Xinjiang was not under Chinese political control, Xinjiang has long had "close contacts with China" that distinguish it from the independent Turkic countries of Central Asia.<ref name="Millward"/> The Gökturks, known in ancient Chinese with pronunciation as Tutkyud as well as modern Chinese pronunciation as Tujue (Tu-chueh; united the Turkic peoples and created a large empire, which broke into various Khanates; the West Tujue Khanate inherited Xinjiang, but West Tujue became part of China's Tang dynasty until the 9th century. However, the terms for West Tujue and East Tujue do not have any relation with the terms West and East Turkestan.<ref name="Rumer"></ref> "Turkestan", which means "region of the Turks", was defined by Arab geographers in the ninth and tenth centuries as the areas northeast of the Sir River.<ref name="Rahman"></ref> For those Arab writers, the Turks were Turkic-speaking nomads and not the sedentary Persian-speaking oasis dwellers.<ref name="Millward"/> With the various migrations and political upheavals following the collapse of the Gökturk confederation and the Mongol invasions "Turkestan", according to the official Chinese position, gradually ceased to be a useful geographic descriptor and was not used.<ref name="wp"></ref>
During the sixteenth century, the Chagatai Khanate completed the Islamization and Turkification of western Xinjiang and the surrounding region, known then as Moghulistan, while China's Ming dynasty held the Eastern Areas. After the Fall of the Ming dynasty, a western Mongol group established a polity in "Chinese Tartary" as it was sometimes known or in eastern Xinjiang, expanding southward into southern Xinjiang.<ref name="Ildiko 2008"></ref> In 1755, the Qing dynasty defeated the Mongol Dzungar Khanate and captured two territories in Xinjiang. The northern territory, where the Dzungars lived, was called Dzungaria, while the southern areas which the Dzungars controlled and mined were called Huijiang (Hui-chiang; or Altishahr.<ref name="Millward"/> The term "Xinjiang", which up until that time simply meant all territories new to the Qing, gradually shifted in meaning for the Qing court to exclusively mean Dzungaria and Altishahr taken together. In 1764, the Qianlong Emperor made this use of Xinjiang as a proper name official and issued an imperial order defining Xinjiang as a "provincial administrative area". After General Tso suppressed the Dungan revolt in 1882, Xinjiang was officially reorganized into a province and the name Xinjiang was popularized,<ref name="Rahman"/> superseding "Xiyu" in writing.<ref name="Starr"/>
At the same time as the Chinese consolidation of control in Xinjiang, explorers from the British and Russian Empire explored, mapped and delineated Central Asia in a The Great Game. Several influential Russians would propose new terms for the territories, as in 1805 when the Russian explorer Timovski revived the use of "Turkestan" to refer to Middle Asia and "East Turkestan" to refer to the Tarim Basin east of Middle Asia in southern Xinjiang or in 1829, when the Russian sinologist Nikita Bichurin proposed the use of "East Turkestan" to replace "Chinese Turkestan" for the Chinese territory east of Bukhara.<ref name="Ildiko 2007"/> The Russian Empire mused expansion into Xinjiang,<ref></ref> which it informally called "Little Bukhara". Between 1851 and 1881, Russia occupied the Ili valley in Xinjiang and continued to negotiate with the Qing for trading and settlement rights for Russians.<ref></ref> Regardless of the new Russian appellations, the original inhabitants of Central Asia generally continued not to use the word "Turkestan" to refer to their own territories.<ref name="car13"/>
After a spate of annexations in Middle Asia, Russia consolidated its holdings west of the Pamir Mountains as the Russian Turkestan or "Russian Turkestan" in 1867.<ref></ref> It is at this time that Western writers began to divide Turkestan into a Russian and a Chinese part.<ref name="wp"/> Although foreigners acknowledged that Xinjiang was a Chinese polity, and that there were Chinese names for the region, some travelers preferred to use "names that emphasized Turkic, Islamic or Central Asian, i.e., non-Chinese characteristics".<ref name="Ildiko 2008"/> For contemporary British travelers and English-language material, there was no consensus on a designation for Xinjiang, with "Chinese Turkestan", "East Turkestan", "Chinese Central Asia", "Serindia"<ref></ref> and "Sinkiang" being used interchangeably to describe the region of Xinjiang.<ref name="Ildiko 2007"/> Until the 20th century, locals used the names of cities or oases in their "territorial self-perception", that expanded or contracted as needed, such as Kashgaria out of Kashgar to refer to southwestern Xinjiang. Altishahr, or "six cities", collectively referred to six vaguely defined cities south of the Tian Shan.<ref name="Ildiko 2008"/>
===Early 20th century===
In 1912, the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing Dynasty and created a Republic of China. As Yuan Dahua, the last Qing governor, fled from Xinjiang, one of his subordinates, Yang Zengxin (杨增新), took control of the province and acceded in name to the Republic of China in March of the same year. In 1921, the Soviet Union officially defined the Uyghurs as the sedentary Turkic peoples from Chinese Turkestan as part of their nation building policy in Central Asia.<ref name="Ildiko 2007"/> Multiple insurgencies arose against Yang's successor Jin Shuren (金树仁) in the early 1930s throughout Xinjiang, usually led by Hui people.<ref></ref> "East Turkestan" became a rallying cry for people who spoke Turki and believed in Islam to rebel against Chinese authorities.<ref name="wp"/> In the Kashgar region on November 12, 1933, Uyghur separatists declared the short-lived<ref name="Pan"/> and self-proclaimed East Turkestan Republic (ETR), using the term "East Turkestan" to emphasize the state's break from China and new anti-China orientation.<ref name="car13"></ref>
The First ETR gave political meaning to the erstwhile geographical term of East Turkestan.<ref name="Millward"/> However, the Chinese warlord Sheng Shicai (盛世才) quickly defeated the ETR and ruled Xinjiang for the decade after 1934 with close support from the Soviet Union.<ref name="Dillon"/> Eventually, though, the Soviet Union exploited the change in power from Sheng to Kuomintang officials to create the puppet Second East Turkestan Republic (1944–1949) in present-day Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture to exploit its minerals,<ref name="Dickens"></ref> later justifying it as a national liberation movement against the "reactionary" Kuomintang regime.<ref name="Ildiko 2007"/> Amid the anti-Han programs and policies<ref name="Dillon"></ref> and exclusion of "pagans",<ref name="wp"/> or Kafir, from the separatist government,<ref name="Dickens"/> Kuomintang leaders based in Dihua (Ürümqi) appealed to the long Chinese history in the region to justify its sovereignty over Xinjiang. In response, Soviet historians produced revisionist histories to help the ETR justify its own claims to sovereignty, with statements such as that the Uyghurs were the "most ancient Turkic people" that had contributed to world civilization.<ref name="Ildiko 2007"/> Traditionally, scholars had thought of Xinjiang as a "cultural backwater" compared to the other Central Asian states during the Islamic Golden Age.<ref name="Ildiko 2008"/> Local British and American consuls, also intrigued by the separatist government, published their own histories of the region. The Soviet Uyghur histories produced during its support of the ETR remain the basis of Uyghur nationalist publications today.<ref name="Ildiko 2007"/>
===Late 20th century===
At the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, with Xinjiang divided between Kuomintang forces and ETR secessionists, the Communist leadership persuaded both governments to surrender and accept the succession of the People's Republic of China government<ref name="Dillon"/> and negotiated the establishment of Communist provincial governments in Yining (Ghulja) and Dihua.<ref name="Gibb"></ref> On October 1, 1955, PRC leader Mao Zedong designated Xinjiang a "Uyghur Autonomous Region",<ref name="Starr"/> creating a regionwide Uyghur identity which overtook Uyghurs' traditionally local and oasis-based identities.<ref></ref> Although the Soviet Union initially suppressed the publications of its past Uyghur studies programs, after the Sino-Soviet split in the 1960s, it revived its Uyghur studies program as part of an "ideological war" against China.<ref name="Ildiko 2007"/><ref name="Shulsky"/> The term "East Turkestan" was popularized in academic works,<ref name="Rumer"/> but inconsistently: at times, the term East Turkestan only referred to area in Xinjiang south of the Tian Shan mountains, corresponding to the Tarim Basin;<ref name="Rumer"/> the areas north of the Tian Shan mountains were called Dzungaria or Zungaria.<ref name="Rahman"/><ref name="Herbertson"></ref><ref></ref> Tursun Rakhimov, a Uyghur historian for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union during the Sino-Soviet split,<ref></ref> argued in his 1981 book "Fate of the Non-Han Peoples of the PRC" that "both" East Turkestan and Dzungaria were conquered by China and "renamed" Xinjiang. Occasionally, he used East Turkestan and Xinjiang interchangeably.<ref name="Ildiko 2007"></ref> Concurrently during the Cultural Revolution and the Revolution's campaigns against "local nationalism", the government had come to associate the term East Turkestan with Uyghur separatism and "" and forbade its usage.<ref name="Rahman"/> Uyghur nationalist historian Turghun Almas and his book Uyghurlar (The Uyghurs) and Uyghur nationalist accounts of history were galvanized by Soviet stances on history, "firmly grounded" in Soviet Turcological works, and both heavily influenced and partially created by Soviet historians and Soviet works on Turkic peoples.<ref> urltoken Bellér-Hann 2007 , p. 42.</ref> Soviet historiography spawned the rendering of Uyghur history found in Uyghurlar.<ref> urltoken Bellér-Hann 2007 , p. 33.</ref> Almas claimed that Central Asia was "the motherland of the Uyghurs" and also the "ancient golden cradle of world culture".<ref> urltoken Bellér-Hann 2007 , p. 4.</ref> The global trends set by the Dissolution of the Soviet Union in the 1990s and the rise of global Islamism<ref name="Starr"/> and pan-Turkism<ref></ref><ref></ref> revived separatist sentiments in Xinjiang and led to a wave of political violence that killed 162 people between 1990 and 2001.<ref name="Rumer"/>
===21st century===
In 2001, the government of China lifted its ban on state media's using the terms "Uyghurstan"<ref name="Starr"/> or "East Turkestan",<ref></ref> as part of a general opening up after the September 11 attacks to the world about political violence in Xinjiang and a plea for international help to suppress East Turkestan terrorists.<ref name="APCSS" /><ref name="Rumer" /> In 2004, the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile was established in Washington, DC to strive for East Turkistan's independence.
On February 28, 2017, it was announced by the Qira County government in Hotan Prefecture that those who reported others for stitching the 'Star and crescent' insignia on their clothing or personal items or having the words 'East Turkestan' on their mobile phone case, purse or other jewelry, would be eligible for cash payments.<ref></ref>
== Current status ==
As the history of Xinjiang in particular is contested between the government of China and Uyghur separatists, the official and common name of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (with its Uyghur loanword counterpart, Shinjang) is rejected by those seeking independence.<ref name="Starr"></ref> "East Turkestan", a term of Russian origin, asserts a continuity with a "West Turkestan" or the now-independent states of Soviet Central Asia.<ref name="Ildiko 2007" /> Not all of those states accept the designation of "Turkestan", however; Tajikistan's Persian-speaking population feels more closely aligned with Iran and Afghanistan.<ref name="Humphrey"></ref> For separatists,<ref></ref><ref name="Chung"></ref> East Turkestan is coterminous with Xinjiang or the independent state that they would like to lead in Xinjiang.<ref></ref> Proponents of the term "East Turkestan" argue that the name Xinjiang is arrogant, because if the individual Chinese characters are to be taken literally and not as a proper name, then Xinjiang means "New Territory".<ref name="Rahman"/> Some Chinese scholars have advocated a name change for the region or a reversion to the older term Xiyu ("Western Regions"), arguing that "Xinjiang" might mislead people into thinking that Xinjiang is "new" to China. Other scholars defend the name, noting that Xinjiang was new to the late Qing dynasty, which gave Xinjiang its current name.<ref name="Rahman"/>
In modern separatist usage,<ref name="Starr"/> "Uyghuristan" (Уйғуристан), which means "land of the Uyghurs", is a synonym for Xinjiang or a potential state in Xinjiang,<ref name="APCSS"></ref> like "East Turkestan".<ref name="bovingdon4"></ref><ref name="Shulsky"></ref> There is no consensus among separatists about whether to use "East Turkestan" or "Uyghurstan";<ref name="Ildiko 2008"/> Uyghurstan is also a difference in emphasis in that it excludes more peoples in Xinjiang than just the Han,<ref name="Priniotakis"></ref> but the "East Turkestan" movement<ref name="Pan"></ref> is still a Uyghur phenomenon. Kazakhs and Hui Muslims are largely alienated from the movement,<ref name="APCSS"/> as are Uyghurs who live closer to the eastern provinces of China. Separatist sentiment is strongest among the Uyghur diaspora,<ref name="Starr"/> who practice what has been called "cyber-separatism", encouraging the use of "East Turkestan" on their websites and literature.<ref></ref> Historically "Uyghurstan" referred to the northeastern oasis region of "Hami-Turpan".<ref name="Gladney"></ref> "Chinese Turkestan", while synonymous with East Turkestan in historical terms,<ref name="Herbertson"/> is not used today, rejected by Uyghur separatists for the "Chinese" part of the name and by China for the "Turkestan" part.<ref name="Millward"></ref>
In China, the terms "East Turkestan", "Uyghurstan"<ref name="Priniotakis"/> and even "Turkestan" alone connotes old Western imperialism and the past East Turkestan republics and modern militant groups, such as the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM). The government of China conflates the violence of differing separatist groups, such as the ETIM and the East Turkestan Liberation Organization, as coming simply from "East Turkestan forces".<ref name="Millward"/> Chinese diplomatic missions have objected to foreigners' use of "East Turkestan". They argue that the term is political and no longer geographical or historical and that its use represents "a provocation" to the sovereignty of China.<ref name="Rahman"/> The historical definitions for "East Turkestan" are multifarious and ambiguous, reflecting that outside of Chinese administration,<ref name="Ildiko 2008"/> the area now called "Xinjiang" was not geographically or demographically a single region.<ref name="Starr"/>

East Turkestan, also East Turkistan ; , varies in meaning by context and usage. The term was coined in the 19th century by Russian Turkology including Nikita Bichurin to replace another Western term, Chinese Turkestan, which referred to the Tarim Basin in the southwestern part of Xinjiang during the Qing dynasty. The medieval Persian toponym "Turkestan" and its derivatives were not, however, used by the local population. The Uyghur name for the Tarim Basin is Altishahr, which means "Six Cities" in Uyghur. Besides, China had since the Han dynasty had its own name for an overlapping area: the "Western Regions." The parts of this area controlled by China were termed "Xinjiang" starting in the 18th century. 
From the 20th century on, Uyghur separatists and their supporters used East Turkestan (or Uyghurstan) as an appellation for the whole of Xinjiang or for a future independent state in present-day Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (presumably with Ürümqi as its capital). They reject the name of Xinjiang (meaning "New Frontier" in Chinese) because of the Chinese perspective reflected in the name and prefer East Turkestan to emphasize connection to other, westerly, Turkic groups. However, even in nationalist writing, East Turkestan retained its older, more narrow geographical meaning.
The First East Turkestan Republic existed from November 12, 1933 until April 16, 1934 and the second Second East Turkestan Republic existed between November 12, 1944 and December 22, 1949.<ref></ref> East Turkestan is a founding member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO), which was formed in 1991, where it is represented by the World Uyghur Congress.<ref name="UNPO"></ref> In September 2004, the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile was established in Washington, D.C.
