Edible mushroom

== History of mushroom use ==
Mycophagy , the act of consuming mushrooms, dates back to ancient times. Edible mushroom species have been found in association with 13,000-year-old archaeological sites in Chile. Ötzi, the mummy of a man who lived between 3400 and 3100 BCE in Europe, was found with two types of mushroom. The Chinese value mushrooms for supposed medicinal properties as well as for food. Ancient Rome and Greeks, particularly the upper classes, used mushrooms for culinary purposes.<ref name=Boa2004 /> Food tasters were employed by Roman emperors to ensure that mushrooms were safe to eat.<ref name=Jordan2006></ref>
== Current culinary use ==
=== Commercially cultivated ===
Mushroom cultivation has a long history, with over twenty species commercially cultivated. Mushrooms are cultivated in at least 60 countries<ref></ref> with China, the United States, Poland, Netherlands, and India being the top five producers in 2013.<ref></ref>
A fraction of the many fungi consumed by humans are currently cultivated and sold commercially. Commercial cultivation is important ecologically, as there have been concerns of depletion of larger fungi such as chanterelles in Europe, possibly because the group has grown popular, yet remains a challenge to cultivate.
* Agaricus bisporus dominates the edible mushroom market in North America and Europe, in several forms. It is an edible basidiomycete mushroom native to grasslands in Europe and North America. As it ages, this mushroom turns from small, white and smooth to large and light brown. In its youngest form, it is known as the 'common mushroom', 'button mushroom', 'cultivated mushroom', and 'champignon mushroom'. Its fully mature form is known as 'portobello'. Its semi-mature form is known variously as 'cremini', 'baby-bella', 'Swiss brown' mushroom, 'Roman brown' mushroom, 'Italian brown' mushroom, or 'chestnut' mushroom.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref name="psu.edu"></ref>

* Cyclocybe aegerita, the pioppino, velvet pioppini, poplar or black poplar mushroom
* Hericium erinaceus, the lion's mane, monkey head, bearded tooth, satyr's beard, bearded hedgehog, or pom pom mushroom.
=== Commercially harvested wild edibles ===
Some species are difficult to cultivate; others (particularly mycorrhizal species) have not yet been successfully cultivated. Some of these species are harvested from the wild, and can be found in markets. When in season they can be purchased fresh, and many species are sold dried as well. The following species are commonly harvested from the wild:
* Boletus edulis or edible Boletus, native to Europe, known in Italian as fungo porcino (plural 'porcini') (pig mushroom), in German as Steinpilz (stone mushroom), in Russian as (white mushroom), in Albanian as (wolf mushroom), in French as the cèpe and in the UK as the penny bun. It is also known as the king bolete, and is renowned for its delicious flavor. It is sought after worldwide, and can be found in a variety of culinary dishes.
* Calbovista subsculpta commonly known as the sculptured giant puffball is a common puffball of the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast ranges of western North America. The puffball is more or less round with a diameter of up to , white becoming brownish in age, and covered with shallow pyramid-shaped plates or scales. It fruits singly or in groups along roads and in open woods at high elevations, from summer to autumn. It is considered a choice edible species while its interior flesh (the gleba) is still firm and white. As the puffball matures, its insides become dark brown and powdery from mature spores.
* Calvatia gigantea the giant puffball. Giant puffballs are considered a choice edible species and are commonly found in meadows, fields, and deciduous forests usually in late summer and autumn. It is found in temperate areas throughout the world.<ref name=Kew></ref> They can reach diameters up to and weights of . The inside of mature Giant puffballs is greenish brown, whereas the interior of immature puffballs is white. The large white mushrooms are edible when young.<ref name=Arora></ref><ref name=Bessette></ref>
* Cantharellus cibarius (the chanterelle), The yellow chanterelle is one of the best and most easily recognizable mushrooms, and can be found in Asia, Europe, North America and Australia. There are poisonous mushrooms which resemble it, though these can be confidently distinguished if one is familiar with the chanterelle's identifying features.
* Craterellus tubaeformis, the tube chanterelle, yellowfoot chanterelle or yellow-leg
* Clitocybe nuda, blewit (or blewitt)
* Cortinarius caperatus, the Gypsy mushroom
* Craterellus cornucopioides, Trompette de la mort (trumpet of death) or horn of plenty
* Grifola frondosa, known in Japan as maitake (also "hen of the woods" or "sheep’s head"), a large, hearty mushroom commonly found on or near stumps and bases of oak trees, and believed to have Macrolepiota procera properties.
* Gyromitra esculenta (the false morel) is prized by the Finns. This mushroom is deadly poisonous if eaten raw, but highly regarded when parboiled (see below).
* Hericium erinaceus, a tooth fungus; also called "lion's mane mushroom"
* Hydnum repandum, sweet tooth fungus, hedgehog mushroom or hedgehog fungus, urchin of the woods
* Lactarius deliciosus, saffron milk cap, consumed around the world and prized in Russia
* Morchella species, (morel family) morels belong to the ascomycete grouping of fungi. They are usually found in open scrub, woodland or open ground in late spring. When collecting this fungus, care must be taken to distinguish it from the poisonous false morels, including Gyromitra esculenta. The morel must be cooked before eating.
** Morchella conica var. deliciosa
** Morchella esculenta var. rotunda
* Pleurotus species are sometimes commercially harvested despite ease of cultivation.
* Tricholoma matsutake, the matsutake, a mushroom highly prized in Japanese cuisine.
* Tuber, species, (the truffle), Truffles have long eluded the modern techniques of domestication known as trufficulture. Although the field of trufficulture has greatly expanded since its inception in 1808, several species still remain uncultivated. Domesticated truffles include
**Tuber aestivum, black summer truffle
** Tuber borchii
** Tuber brumale
** Tuber indicum, Chinese black truffle
** Tuber macrosporum, smooth black truffle
** Tuber mesentericum, the Bagnoli truffle<ref>T. mesenterium was first reported in Great Britain after the wet August 2008: </ref>

=== Conditionally-edible species ===
* Amanita fulva (Tawny Grisette) must be cooked before eating.
* Amanita muscaria is edible if parboiled to leach out toxins,<ref name=Arora2008></ref> fresh mushrooms cause vomiting, twitching, drowsiness, and hallucinations due to the presence of muscimol. Although present in A. muscaria, ibotenic acid is not in high enough concentration to produce any physical or psychological effects unless massive amounts are ingested.
* Amanita rubescens (The Blusher) must be cooked before eating.
* Coprinopsis atramentaria (Coprinus atramentarius - Common Inkcap) is edible without special preparation, however, consumption with alcohol is toxic due to the presence of coprine. Some other Coprinus spp. share this property.
* Gyromitra esculenta (False Morel - Turban, Brain Mushroom) is eaten by some after it has been parboiled, however, many mycologists do not recommend it. Raw Gyromitra are toxic due to the presence of gyromitrin, and it is not known whether all of the toxin can be removed by parboiling.
* Lactarius spp. Apart from Lactarius deliciosus (Saffron Milkcap), which is universally considered edible, other Lactarius spp. that are considered toxic elsewhere in the world are eaten in some Eastern European countries and Russia after pickling or parboiling.<ref>Arora, David. Mushrooms Demystified, 2nd ed. Ten Speed Press, 1986</ref>
* Lepista saeva (Field Blewit, Blue Leg, or Tricholoma personatum) must be cooked before eating.
* Morchella esculenta (Morel) must be cooked before eating.<ref name=":0"></ref>
* Verpa bohemica is considered choice by some—it even can be found for sale as a "morel"—but cases of toxicity have been reported. Verpas appear to contain monomethylhydrazine<ref> urltoken FDA IMPORT ALERT IA2502 </ref> and similar precautions apply to them as Gyromitra species.
==Nutrients==
A commonly eaten mushroom is the white mushroom (Agaricus bisporus). In a reference serving, Agaricus mushrooms provide of food energy and are 92% water, 3% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and 0.3% fat (table). They contain high levels (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of riboflavin, niacin, and pantothenic acid (24–33% DV), with moderate content of phosphorus (table). Otherwise, raw white mushrooms generally have low amounts of essential nutrients (table). Although cooking (by boiling) lowers mushroom water content only 1%, the contents per 100 grams for several nutrients increase appreciably, especially for dietary minerals (table for boiled mushrooms).
The content of vitamin D is absent or low unless mushrooms are exposed to sunlight or purposely treated with artificial ultraviolet light (see below), even after harvesting and processed into dry powder.<ref name=LATeat/><ref name=d2/>
=== Vitamin D ===
Mushrooms exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light produce vitamin D2 before or after harvest by converting ergosterol, a chemical found in large concentrations in mushrooms, to vitamin D<sub>2</sub>.<ref name="LATeat"></ref><ref name="d2"></ref> This is similar to the reaction in humans, where Cholecalciferol is synthesized after exposure to sunlight.
Testing showed an hour of UV light exposure before harvesting made a serving of mushrooms contain twice the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's daily recommendation of vitamin D, and 5 minutes of artificial UV light exposure after harvesting made a serving of mushrooms contain four times the FDA's daily recommendation of vitamin D.<ref name="LATeat" /> Analysis also demonstrated that natural sunlight produced vitamin D<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=d2/>
The ergocalciferol, vitamin D<sub>2</sub>, in UV-irradiated mushrooms is not the same Vitamin D#Synthesis mechanism (form 3) or animal skin, fur, or feathers (cholecalciferol, vitamin D<sub>3</sub>). Although vitamin D<sub>2</sub> clearly has vitamin D activity in humans and is widely used in food fortification and in Dietary supplement, vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is more commonly used in dairy and cereal products.

Edible mushrooms are the fleshy and Eating fruit bodies of several species of macrofungi (fungi which bear fruiting structures that are large enough to be seen with the naked eye). They can appear either below ground (hypogeous) or above ground (epigeous) where they may be picked by hand.<ref name=def></ref> Edibility may be defined by criteria that include absence of poisonous effects on humans and desirable taste and aroma.<ref name="Mattila et al"></ref>
Edible mushrooms are consumed for their nutritional and cuisine value. Mushrooms, especially dried shiitake, are sources of umami flavor from guanylate.<ref></ref>
Mushrooms consumed by those practicing folk medicine are known as Medicinal fungi. While psychedelic mushrooms are occasionally consumed for recreational or entheogenic purposes, they can produce psychological effects, and are therefore not commonly used as food.<ref name=Boa2004></ref> While there is no evidence (as of 2019) from high-quality clinical research that "medicinal" mushrooms have an effect on human diseases<ref name="mlp2019"></ref><ref name="Money"></ref>, a number of potential medicinal effects have been shown in non-clinical studies <ref> urltoken 
Edible mushrooms include many fungal species that are either harvested wild or cultivated. Easily cultivated and common wild mushrooms are often available in markets, and those that are more difficult to obtain (such as the prized truffle, matsutake and morel) may be collected on a smaller scale by private gatherers. Some preparations may render certain mushroom poisoning fit for consumption.
Before assuming that any wild mushroom is edible, it should be identified. Accurate determination and proper identification of a species is the only safe way to ensure edibility, and the only safeguard against possible accident. Some mushrooms that are edible for most people can cause allergic reactions in some individuals, and old or improperly stored specimens can cause food poisoning. Great care should therefore be taken when eating any fungus for the first time, and only small quantities should be consumed in case of individual allergies. Deadly poisonous mushrooms that are frequently confused with edible mushrooms and responsible for many fatal poisonings include several species of the genus Amanita, in particular, Amanita phalloides, the death cap. It is therefore better to eat only a few, easily recognizable species, than to experiment indiscriminately. Moreover, even normally edible species of mushrooms may be dangerous, as mushrooms growing in polluted locations can accumulate pollutants such as heavy metals.<ref name=kalac00></ref>
