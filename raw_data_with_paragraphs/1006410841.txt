Pasty

==History==
Despite the modern pasty's strong association with Cornwall, its exact origins are unclear. The English word "pasty" derives from Medieval French (O.Fr. paste from V.Lat pasta<ref></ref>) for a pie, filled with venison, salmon or other meat, vegetables or cheese, baked without a dish.<ref></ref> Pasties have been mentioned in cookbooks throughout the ages. For example, the earliest version of Le Viandier (Old French) has been dated to around 1300 and contains several pasty recipes.<ref></ref> In 1393, Le Menagier contains recipes for pasté with venison, veal, beef, or mutton.<ref></ref>
Other early references to pasties include a 13th-century charter that was granted by Henry III (1207–1272) to the town of Great Yarmouth. The town is bound to send to the sheriffs of Norwich every year one hundred herrings, baked in twenty four pasties, which the sheriffs are to deliver to the lord of the manor of East Carlton who is then to convey them to the King.<ref></ref> Around the same time, 13th-century chronicler Matthew Paris wrote of the monks of St Albans Abbey "according to their custom, lived upon pasties of flesh-meat".<ref></ref> A total of 5,500 venison pasties were served at the installation feast of George Neville, archbishop of York and chancellor of England in 1465.<ref></ref> 
The earliest reference for a pasty in Devon can be found in Plymouth City Records of 1509/10, which describe "Itm for the cooke is labor to make the pasties 10d."<ref></ref> 
They were even eaten by royalty, as a letter from a baker to Henry VIII's third wife, Jane Seymour (1508–1537) confirms: ".hope this pasty reaches you in better condition than the last one ."<ref></ref> In his diaries written in the mid-17th century, Samuel Pepys makes several references to his consumption of pasties, for instance "dined at Sir W. Pen's . on a damned venison pasty, that stunk like a devil.",<ref></ref> but after this period the use of the word outside Devon and Cornwall declined.<ref name="mason & brown"></ref>
In contrast to its earlier place amongst the wealthy, during the 17th and 18th centuries, the pasty became popular with working people in Cornwall, where tin miners and others adopted it due to its unique shape, forming a complete meal that could be carried easily and eaten without cutlery.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref name="grigson" /> In a mine, the pasty's dense, folded pastry could stay warm for several hours, and if it did get cold, it could easily be warmed on a shovel over a candle.<ref name="context" />
Side-crimped pasties gave rise to the suggestion that the miner might have eaten the pasty holding the thick edge of pastry, which was later discarded, thereby ensuring that his dirty fingers (possibly including traces of arsenic) did not touch food or his mouth.<ref name="DEFRA" /> However, many old photographs show that pasties were wrapped in bags made of paper or muslin and were eaten from end to end;<ref></ref> according to the earliest Cornish recipe book, published in 1929, this is "the true Cornish way" to eat a pasty.<ref name=CRAM></ref> Another theory suggests that pasties were marked at one end with an initial and then eaten from the other end so that if not finished in one go, they could easily be reclaimed by their owners.<ref name="context"></ref>

Lambert, Cornwall, Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1945, p. 38</ref><ref> urltoken The West Briton, Commercial pasty companies are failing our Cornish national dish, 23 September 2010</ref> and an early reference is from a New Zealand newspaper:</ref>
* They are also popular in South Africa, New Zealand<ref name="newzealand"></ref> and Ulster.
* Pasties were modified with different spices and fillings in Jamaica, giving rise to the Jamaican patty.
* Similar dishes are found in many countries such as empanadas in Spanish speaking countries, Coulibiac in Eastern Europe, Tourtière in Canada and Shaobing in China.
==Culture==
===Literature===
Pasties have been mentioned in multiple literary works since the 12th century Matter of Britain Erec and Enide, written by Chrétien de Troyes, in which they are eaten by characters from the area now known as Cornwall.<ref name="context" /><ref name="WhoInvented"></ref> There is a mention in Havelok the Dane, another romance written at the end of the thirteenth century;<ref> (line 645)</ref> in the 14th century Robin Hood tales; in Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales;<ref name="context" /> and in three plays by William Shakespeare.<ref>In The Merry Wives of Windsor Act 1 Scene 1, Page says Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a hot venison pasty to dinner: come gentlemen, I hope we shall drink down all unkindness.</ref><ref>In All's Well That Ends Well, Act IV Scene III, Parrolles states: I will confess to what I know without constraint: if ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.</ref><ref>In Titus Andronicus, Titus bakes Chiron and Demetrius's bodies into a pasty, and forces their mother to eat them.</ref>
Pasties appear in many novels, used to draw parallels or represent Cornwall. In American Gods by Neil Gaiman, main character Shadow discovers pasties at Mabel's restaurant in the fictional town of Lakeside. The food is mentioned as being popularised in America by Cornishmen, as a parallel to how gods are "brought over" to America in the rest of the story. Another literature reference takes place in The Cat Who . series by Lilian Jackson Braun. Pasties are referred to as a cultural part of the north country, and Jim Qwilleran often eats at The Nasty Pasty, a popular restaurant in fictional Moose County, famous for its tradition of being a mining settlement. Reference to pasties is made in Brian Jacques' popular Redwall series of novels, where it is a staple favourite on the menu to the mice and hares of Redwall Abbey. Pasties also appear in the Poldark series of historical novels of Cornwall, by Winston Graham, as well as the BBC television series adapted from these works.
===Superstitions, rhymes and chants===
In the tin mines of Devon and Cornwall, pasties were associated with "knockers", spirits said to create a knocking sound that was either supposed to indicate the location of rich veins of ore,<ref></ref> or to warn of an impending tunnel collapse. To encourage the good will of the knockers, miners would leave a small part of the pasty within the mine for them to eat.<ref name="Trust"></ref> Sailors and fisherman would likewise discard a crust to appease the spirits of dead mariners, though fishermen believed that it was bad luck to take a pasty aboard ship.<ref name="Trust" />
A Cornish proverb, recounted in 1861, emphasised the great variety of ingredients that were used in pasties by saying that the devil would not come into Cornwall for fear of ending up as a filling in one.<ref></ref> A West Country schoolboy playground-rhyme current in the 1940s concerning the pasty went: In 1959 the English singer-songwriter Cyril Tawney wrote a nostalgic song called "The Oggie Man". The song tells of the pasty-seller with his characteristic vendor's call who was always outside Plymouth's HMNB Devonport gates late at night when the sailors were returning, and his replacement by hot dog sellers after World War II.<ref></ref>
The word "oggy" in the internationally popular chant "Oggy Oggy Oggy" is thought to stem from Cornish dialect "hoggan", deriving from "hogen" the Cornish word for pasty. When the pasties were ready for eating, the bal maidens at the mines would supposedly shout down the shaft "Oggy Oggy Oggy" and the miners would reply "Oi Oi Oi".<ref></ref>
===Giant pasties===
As the national dish of Cornwall, several oversized versions of the pasty have been created in the county. For example, a giant pasty is paraded from Polruan to Fowey through the streets during regatta week.<ref></ref> Similarly, a giant pasty is paraded around the ground of the Cornish Pirates rugby team on St Piran's Day before it is passed over the goal posts.<ref></ref>
The world's largest Cornish pasty was made in August 2010, measuring and weighing . It used of beef, of swede, of potatoes and of onions.

A pasty <ref>Oxford Learner's Dictionaries, s.v. urltoken "pasty".</ref>) is a British baked pastry, a traditional variety of which is particularly associated with Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is made by placing an uncooked filling, typically meat and vegetables, on one half of a flat shortcrust pastry circle, folding the pastry in half to wrap the filling in a semicircle and crimping the curved edge to form a seal before baking.
The traditional Cornish pasty, which since 2011 has Protected Geographical Status (PGI) status in Europe,<ref name=L193 /> is filled with beef, sliced or diced potato, swede (also known as yellow turnip or rutabaga – referred to in Cornwall as turnip) and onion, seasoned with salt and pepper, and baked. Today, the pasty is the food most associated with Cornwall. It is regarded as the national dish and accounts for 6% of the Cornish food economy. Pasties with many different fillings are made and some shops specialise in selling all sorts of pasties.
The origins of the pasty are unclear, though there are many references to them throughout historical documents and fiction. The pasty is now popular worldwide due to the Cornish diaspora and sailors from across Cornwall, and variations can be found in Australia, Mexico, the United States, Ulster and elsewhere.
Pasties also resemble turnovers from many other cuisines and cultures, including the bridie in Scotland, empanada in Spanish-speaking countries, pirog in Eastern Europe, tourtière in Canada and shaobing in China.
