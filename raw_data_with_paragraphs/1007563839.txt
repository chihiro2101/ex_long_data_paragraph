Avocado

==Culinary uses==
The fruit of horticultural cultivars has a markedly higher fat content than most other fruit, mostly monounsaturated fat, and as such serves as an important staple in the diet of consumers who have limited access to other fatty foods (high-fat meats and fish, dairy products). Having a high smoke point, avocado oil is expensive compared to common salad and cooking oils, and is mostly used for salads or dips.
A ripe avocado yields to gentle pressure when held in the palm of the hand and squeezed. The flesh is prone to enzymatic browning, quickly turning brown after exposure to air.<ref></ref> To prevent this, lime or lemon juice can be added to avocados after peeling.
The fruit is not sweet, but distinctly and subtly flavored, with smooth texture.<ref name=morton/> It is used in both savory and sweet dishes, though in many countries not for both. The avocado is common in vegetarian cuisine as a substitute for meats in sandwiches and salads because of its high fat content.
Generally, avocado is served raw, though some cultivars, including the common 'Hass', can be cooked for a short time without becoming bitter. The flesh of some avocados may be rendered inedible by heat. Prolonged cooking induces this chemical reaction in all cultivars.<ref></ref>
It is used as the base for the Mexican dip known as guacamole,<ref name=morton/> as well as a spread on corn tortillas or toast, served with spices.
In the Philippines, Brazil, Indonesia, Vietnam, and southern India (especially the coastal Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka region), avocados are frequently used for milkshakes and occasionally added to ice cream and other desserts.<ref> urltoken In Brazil, Vietnam, the Philippines<ref name="zeldes"></ref> and Indonesia, a dessert drink is made with sugar, milk or water, and pureed avocado. Chocolate syrup is sometimes added. In Morocco, a similar chilled avocado and milk drink is sweetened with confectioner's sugar and flavored with a touch of orange flower water.
In Ethiopia, avocados are made into juice by mixing them with sugar and milk or water, usually served with Vimto and a slice of lemon. It is also common to serve layered multiple fruit juices in a glass (locally called Spris) made of avocados, mangoes, bananas, guavas, and papayas. Avocados are also used to make salads.
Avocados in savory dishes, often seen as exotic, are a relative novelty in Portuguese-speaking countries, such as Brazil, where the traditional preparation is mashed with sugar and lime, and eaten as a dessert or snack. This contrasts with Spanish-speaking countries such as Chile, Mexico, or Argentina, where the opposite is true and sweet preparations are rare.
In Australia and New Zealand, avocados are commonly served on sandwiches, sushi, toast, or with chicken. In Ghana, they are often eaten alone on sliced bread as a sandwich. In Sri Lanka, their well-ripened flesh, thoroughly mashed or pureed with milk and kitul treacle (a liquid jaggery made from the sap of the inflorescence of Caryota urens), is a common dessert.<ref name="K.2012"></ref> In Haiti, they are often consumed with cassava or regular bread for breakfast.
In Mexico and Central America, avocados are served mixed with white rice, in soups, salads, or on the side of chicken and meat. They are also commonly added to pozole. In Peru, they are consumed with tequeños as mayonnaise, served as a side dish with Asado, used in salads and sandwiches, or as a whole dish when filled with tuna, shrimp, or chicken. In Chile, it is used as a puree-like sauce with chicken, hamburgers, and hot dogs; and in slices for celery or lettuce salads. The Chilean version of Caesar salad contains large slices of mature avocado. In Kenya and Nigeria, the avocado is often eaten as a fruit alone or mixed with other fruits in a fruit salad, or as part of a vegetable salad.
Avocado is a primary ingredient in avocado soup. Avocado slices are frequently added to hamburgers, tortas, hot dogs, and carne asada. Avocado can be combined with eggs (in scrambled eggs, tortillas, or omelettes), and is a key ingredient in California rolls and other makizushi ("maki", or rolled sushi).
In the United Kingdom, the avocado became available during the 1960s when introduced by Sainsbury's under the name 'avocado pear'.<ref name=Scotsman /> Much of the success of avocados in the UK is attributed to a long-running promotional campaign initiated by South African growers in 1995.<ref></ref>
===Leaves===
In addition to the fruit, the leaves of Mexican avocados (Persea americana var. drymifolia) are used in some cuisines as a spice, with a flavor somewhat reminiscent of anise.<ref></ref> They are sold both dried and fresh, toasted before use, and either crumbled or used whole, commonly in bean dishes.<ref></ref> Leaves of P. americana, Guatemalan variety, are toxic to goats, sheep, and horses.<ref></ref>
==Nutrition and health==
===Nutrients===
Raw avocado flesh is 73% water, 15% fat, 9% carbohydrates, and 2% protein (table). In a 100 gram reference amount, avocado supplies 160 calories, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of several B vitamins (such as 28% DV in pantothenic acid) and vitamin K (20% DV), with moderate contents (10-19% DV) of vitamin C, vitamin E, and potassium. Avocados also contain phytosterols and carotenoids, such as lutein and zeaxanthin.<ref></ref>
====Fat composition====
Avocados have diverse fats.<ref name=ND></ref> For a typical one:
* About 75% of an avocado's energy comes from fat, most of which (67% of total fat) is monounsaturated fat as oleic acid (table).<ref name=ND/>
* Other predominant fats include palmitic acid and linoleic acid.<ref name=ND/>
* The saturated fat content amounts to 14% of the total fat.<ref name=ND/> 
* Typical total fat composition is roughly: 1%&nbsp;ω-3, 14%&nbsp;ω-6, 71%&nbsp;ω-9 (65% oleic and 6% palmitoleic), and 14% saturated fat (palmitic acid).<ref name=ND/>
Although costly to produce, nutrient-rich avocado oil has a multitude of uses for salads or cooking and in cosmetics and soap products.<ref name=morton/>
===Allergies===
Some people have allergic reactions to avocado. There are two main forms of allergy: those with a tree-pollen allergy develop local symptoms in the mouth and throat shortly after eating avocado; the second, known as latex-fruit syndrome,<ref name="pmid9188921"></ref> is related to latex allergy<ref></ref> and symptoms include generalised urticaria, abdominal pain, and vomiting and can sometimes be life-threatening.<ref></ref>
===Toxicity to animals===
Avocado leaves, bark, skin, or pit are documented to be harmful to animals; cats, dogs, cattle, goats, rabbits,<ref></ref> rats, guinea pigs, birds, fish, and horses<ref name="kgkat.tripod.com"/><ref></ref> can be severely harmed or even killed when they consume them. The avocado fruit is poisonous to some birds, and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) lists it as toxic to horses.<ref></ref>
Avocado leaves contain a toxic fatty acid derivative, persin, which in sufficient quantity can cause colic in horses and without veterinary treatment, death.<ref name="pmid8581318"></ref> The symptoms include gastrointestinal irritation, vomiting, diarrhea, respiratory distress, congestion, fluid accumulation around the tissues of the heart, and even death. Birds also seem to be particularly sensitive to this toxic compound. A line of premium dog and cat food, AvoDerm, uses oils and meal made from avocado meat as main ingredients.<ref></ref> The manufacturer says the avocado's leaves and pit are the source of toxicity, and only in the Guatemalan variety of avocados, and the fruit is often eaten by orchard dogs as well as wildlife such as bears and coyotes.<ref></ref>

In 2019, world production of avocados was 5.9 million tonnes, led by Mexico with 32% (2.3 million tonnes) of the total (table). Other major producers were Dominican Republic, Peru, Colombia, and Indonesia, together producing 31% of the world total (table).<ref name=faostat/> 
In 2018, the US Department of Agriculture estimated that in total were under cultivation for avocado production in Mexico, a 6% increase over the previous year, and that 2 million tonnes would be exported.<ref name="fas"></ref> The Mexican state of Michoacán is the world leader in avocado production, accounting for 80% of all Mexican output.<ref name=fas/> Most Mexican growers produce the Hass avocado due to its longer shelf life for shipping and high demand among consumers.<ref name=fas/>
During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, Mexican avocado farmers restricted harvesting as the overall demand and supply chain slowed.<ref name=ffp2020/> Later in 2020, demand increased,<ref name=ffp2020/> causing prices to rise as well.<ref></ref> Seventy-five percent of Mexico's exports of avocados go to the United States, with the free trade agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico in July 2020 facilitating avocado shipments within the North American free trade zone.<ref name=ffp2020/> Mexican avocado exports are challenged by growth of production by Peru and Chile to supply the European market.<ref name=ffp2020/>
