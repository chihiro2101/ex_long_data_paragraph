HTMS Chakri Naruebet

==Design==
The original plan was to acquire a 7,800 ton vessel from Bremer Vulcan, but the Thai government cancelled this contract on 22 July 1991.<ref name=Janes08.09/> A new contract for a larger warship to be constructed at Bazán's shipyard in Ferrol, Spain was signed by the Thai and Spanish governments on 27 March 1992.<ref name=Janes08.09/> The proposed vessel was based on the design of the Spanish Navy aircraft carrier , which in turn was based on the United States Navy's Sea Control Ship concept.<ref name=Bischan88/><ref name=Ireland249/> The design is formally referred to by the RTN as an "Offshore Patrol Helicopter Carrier".<ref name="Pike ed., Chakri Naruebet"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="Royal Thai Navy"/>
Chakri Naruebet while still operating with Harriers was the smallest aircraft carrier with a fixed wing air group in operation in the world.

The carrier is equipped with four Mark 36 SRBOC,<ref name=Bischan89/> and an SLQ-25 towed decoy.
In April 2012 Saab won a contract to upgrade Chakri Naruebets command and control systems. This will include fitting a 9LV Mk4 command and control system to the ship as well as a Giraffe radar radar and improved datalinks.<ref></ref>
==Construction==
Work on the Thai carrier commenced in October 1993, although it was not until 12 July 1994 that the hull was laid down.<ref name=Bischan88/><ref name=Janes08.09/> Chakri Naruebet was launched on 20 January 1996<ref name=Bischan88/> by Queen Sirikit.
Sea trials were conducted from October 1996 to January 1997, the latter part of which was in coordination with the Spanish Navy.<ref name=Bischan88/><ref name=Janes08.09/> This was followed by aviation trials at Rota, Spain.<ref name=Janes08.09/> The carrier was handed over on 27 March 1997, when she was commissioned into the RTN.<ref name=Werth772/><ref name=Janes08.09/> She arrived in Phuket on 4 August 1997 following a 42-day voyage from Spain, and formally entered service on 10 August.<ref name=Bischan88/><ref></ref>
Chakri Naruebet cost US$336 million to build.<ref name=Carp302>Carpenter & Wiencek, Asian Security Handbook 2000, p. 302</ref>
==Role and operational history==
Chakri Naruebet is the first aircraft carrier to be operated by a Southeast Asian nation.<ref name=Bischan88>Bishop & Chant, Aircraft Carriers, p. 88</ref> She is assigned to the Third Naval Area Command, and her intended duties include operational support of the RTN's amphibious warfare forces, patrols and force projection around Thailand's coastline and economic exclusion zone, disaster relief and humanitarian missions, and Search and rescue operations.<ref name=Werth772/><ref name=Bischan88/><ref name=Janes08.09/><ref name=Ireland249/><ref name=Carp302/> However, at the time the carrier entered service, the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis prevented the necessary funding to operate the ship from being available.<ref name=Bischan88/><ref name=Carp302/> Consequently, Chakri Naruebet was usually only operational for a single day per month for training, with the rest of the time spent alongside as a "part-time tourist attraction".<ref name=Werth772/><ref name=Bischan88/><ref name=Carp302/> The struggles continued for years, but today it is increasingly common to see her participate in maritime exercise or joint forces exercise – including PASSEX, CARAT, Guardian Sea and Cobra Gold. She was also sent for a fleet review such as 2017 International Maritime Review in Singapore.
Naval commentators usually consider Chakri Naruebet to be less an aircraft carrier and more the world's largest and most expensive royal yacht, while the Thai media have nicknamed the ship "Thai-tanic", and consider her to be a white elephant.<ref name=Bischan88/><ref name=Carp302/>
Between 4 and 7 November 1997, Chakri Naruebet participated in disaster relief operations following the passage of Tropical Storm Linda across the Gulf of Thailand and the Kra Isthmus.<ref name=RTNdisaster>Chakri Nauebet disaster relief missions, Royal Thai Navy</ref> The carrier's main task was to search for and assist any fishing vessels affected by the storm.<ref name=RTNdisaster/>
Flooding in the Songkhla Province resulted in the carrier's mobilisation in late November 2000.<ref name=RTNdisaster/> Chakri Naruebet was anchored at an island marina off Songkhla, and used as a base for helicopters and small boats transporting food, supplies, and wounded.<ref name=RTNdisaster/>
In January 2003 after 2003 Phnom Penh riots, she was sent for her only "show of force" type mission to date—as an "insurance" policy for the Pochentong-1 evacuation plan. 
Following an 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, tsunamis struck multiple regions around the Indian Ocean, including the Andaman Sea coast of Thailand. The personnel of Chakri Naruebet were part of a 760-strong response by the Thai military to the disaster.<ref name=RTNdisaster/> This task force was involved in search-and-rescue around Phuket and the Phi Phi Islands, treatment of wounded and handling of dead, and repair work to schools and government facilities.<ref name=RTNdisaster/>
During the August 2005 filming of Rescue Dawn, a dramatized biographical film of US Navy pilot Dieter Dengler and his capture during the Vietnam War, the flight deck of Chakri Naruebet was used to represent the carrier .<ref></ref>
In November 2010, the ship was involved in flood relief operations following the 2010 Thai floods; anchored off Songkhla Province, relief supplies and food were airlifted to people in the region, while hospital patients were evacuated by the ship's helicopters.<ref>Earth Times, Thai aircraft carrier used as floating kitchen</ref><ref></ref> Chakri Naruebet was sent to Ko Tao in late-March during the 2011 Southern Thailand floods, as the heavy storms causing the flooding had isolated the island, requiring the evacuation of tourists and local citizens.<ref name=BP2011>Bangkok Post, Navy races South to aid victims</ref>
On January 11, 2021, the RTN reported two sailors from the Chakri Naruebet were confirmed positive with COVID-19 after visiting Pah Daeng beer house in Sattahip district.<ref> urltoken

HTMS Chakri Naruebet (CVH-911) , meaning 'Sovereign of the Chakri Dynasty', the Thai monarchy's ruling family)<ref name="no-aircraft"/><ref name=Werth772/> is the flagship of the Royal Thai Navy (RTN), and Thailand's first and only aircraft carrier, although the RTN refers to her as an "Offshore Patrol Helicopter Carrier".<ref name="Pike ed., Chakri Naruebet">Pike (ed.), Chakri Naruebet</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">Chakri Naruebet, Thailand, naval-technology.com</ref><ref name="Royal Thai Navy"></ref> Based on the Spanish Navy's design and constructed by Spanish shipbuilder Bazán, Chakri Naruebet was ordered in 1992, laid down in 1994, launched in 1996, and commissioned into the RTN in 1997. The ship is the smallest functioning aircraft carrier in the world.<ref name="no-aircraft"/>
The aircraft carrier was designed to operate an air group of V/STOL fighter aircraft and helicopters, and is fitted with an aircraft ski-jump. Initial intentions were to operate a mixed air group of ex-Spanish AV-8S Matador aircraft<ref name="costs"></ref> and Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk helicopters. However, by 1999 it was reported that only one Matador was operational due to parts, training, and fiscal limitations,<ref name="costs"/><ref name=Goebel/><ref name=Carp302/> although three Matadors were spotted on the ship during a show of force after the 29 January 2003 Phnom Penh riots in Cambodia. Her entire Harrier V/STOL jet fleet was removed from service in 2006.<ref name="no-aircraft"></ref> Although Chakri Naruebet was intended for patrols and force projection in Thai waters, a lack of funding brought on by the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis meant the carrier has spent most of her career docked at the Sattahip naval base.
Chakri Naruebet has been deployed on several disaster relief operations, including in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, and in response to separate flooding incidents in late-2010 and early-2011. Other than disaster relief, the carrier's few other departures from port are for a single training day per month,<ref name=Carp302/> and transportation of the Royal Family of Thailand, leading to claims by some naval commentators that the ship is merely an oversized royal yacht.<ref name=Werth772/><ref name=Bischan88/>
