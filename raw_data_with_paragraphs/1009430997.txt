Christie's

== History ==
=== Founding ===
The official company literature states that founder James Christie (1730–1803) conducted the first sale in London, England, on 5 December 1766,<ref></ref> and the earliest auction catalogue the company retains is from December 1766. However, other sources note that James Christie rented auction rooms from 1762, and newspaper advertisements for Christie's sales dating from 1759 have also been traced.<ref>Daily Gazetteer (London, England), 25 September 1762; Issue 10460</ref> After his death, Christie's son, James Christie the Younger (1773–1831) took over the business.<ref>M.A. Michael (2019).

=== 1979–1990s ===
Christie's was a public company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, from 1973 to 1999. In 1974, Jo Floyd was appointed chairman of Christie's. He served as chairman of Christie's International plc from 1976 to 1988, until handing over to Lord Carrington, and later was a non-executive director until 1992.<ref>Sarah Lyall (27 February 1998), urltoken Jo Floyd, 74; Led Growth and Change at Christie's The New York Times.</ref> Christie's International Inc. held its first sale in the United States in 1977.

In 1990, the company reversed a long-standing policy and guaranteed a minimum price for a collection of artworks in its May auctions.<ref>Rita Reif (12 March 1990), urltoken Christie's Reverses Stand on Price Guarantees The New York Times.</ref> In 1996, sales exceeded those of Sotheby's for the first time since 1954.<ref>Carol Vogel (6 May 1998), urltoken Frenchman Gets Big Stake In Christie's The New York Times.</ref> However, profits did not grow at the same pace;<ref name="Carol Vogel 1998">Carol Vogel (19 May 1998), urltoken Frenchman Seeks the Rest Of Christie's The New York Times.</ref> from 1993 through 1997, Christie's annual pretax profits were about $60 million, whereas Sotheby's annual pretax profits were about $265 million for those years.<ref name="ReferenceA">Carol Vogel (19 February 1998), urltoken Christie's Ends Talks On Takeover By Swiss The New York Times.</ref>
In 1993, Christie's paid $12.7 million for the London gallery Spink & Son, which specialised in Oriental art and British paintings; the gallery was run as a separate entity. The company bought Leger Gallery for $3.3 million in 1996, and merged it with Spink to become Spink-Leger.<ref>Carol Vogel (22 June 2001), urltoken Re: Real Estate The New York Times.</ref> Spink-Leger closed in 2002. To make itself competitive with Sotheby's in the property market, Christie's bought Great Estates in 1995, then the largest network of independent estate agents in North America, changing its name to Christie's Great Estates Inc.<ref name="nytimes.com" />
=== 1998 takeover ===
In December 1997, under the chairmanship of Lord Hindlip, Christie's put itself on the auction block, but after two months of negotiations with the consortium-led investment firm Warburg Dillon Read it did not attract a bid high enough to accept.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> In May 1998, François Pinault's holding company, Groupe Artémis S.A., first bought 29.1 percent of the company for $243.2 million, and subsequently purchased the rest of it in a deal that valued the entire company at $1.2 billion.<ref name="Carol Vogel 1998" /> The company has since not been reporting profits, though it gives sale totals twice a year. Its policy, in line with UK accounting standards, is to convert non-UK results using an average exchange rate weighted daily by sales throughout the year.<ref name="bloomberg.com">Scott Reyburn (17 July 2012), urltoken Rothko, Private Sales Help Boost Christie's Revenue 13% Bloomberg.</ref>
=== Price-fixing scandal in 2000 ===
In 2000, allegations surfaced of a price-fixing arrangement between Christie's and Sotheby's. Executives from Christie's subsequently alerted the Department of Justice of their suspicions of commission-fixing collusion.
Christie's gained immunity from prosecution in the United States as a longtime employee of Christie's confessed and cooperated with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. Numerous members of Sotheby's senior management were fired soon thereafter, and A. Alfred Taubman, the largest shareholder of Sotheby's at the time, took most of the blame; he and Dede Brooks (the CEO) were given jail sentences, and Christie's, Sotheby's and their owners also paid a civil lawsuit settlement of $512 million.<ref name="AR"></ref><ref name="CM"></ref><ref name="KW"></ref>
=== 2000s ===
In 2002, Christie's France held its first auction in Paris.<ref>Souren Melikian (17 January 2004), urltoken The battle of Paris: Christie's rising International Herald Tribune.</ref>
Like Sotheby's, Christie's became increasingly involved in high-profile private transactions. In 2006, Christie's offered a reported $21 million guarantee to the Donald Judd Foundation and displayed the artist's works for five weeks in an exhibition that later won an AICA award for "Best Installation in an Alternative Space".<ref>Souren Melikian (12 January 2007), urltoken How Christie's kept top spot over Sotheby's in 2006 sales The New York Times.</ref> In 2007 it brokered a $68 million deal that transferred Thomas Eakins's The Gross Clinic (1875) from the Jefferson Medical College at the Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia to joint ownership by the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.<ref>Judd Tully (24 October 2011), urltoken Private Sales Go Public: Why Christie's and Sotheby's Are Embracing Galleries Like Never Before The New York Observer.</ref> In the same year, the Haunch of Venison gallery<ref>Colin Gleadell (27 February 2007), urltoken Christie's move stuns dealers The Daily Telegraph.</ref> became a subsidiary of the company.<ref>Kate Taylor (16 April 2007), urltoken Auction Houses Vs.

On 28 December 2008, The Sunday Times reported that Pinault's debts left him "considering" the sale of Christie's and that a number of "private equity groups" were thought to be interested in its acquisition.<ref></ref> In January 2009, the company employed 2,100 people worldwide, though an unspecified number of staff and consultants were soon to be cut due to a worldwide downturn in the art market;<ref name="downturn"></ref> later news reports said that 300 jobs would be cut.<ref name="downturn2"></ref> With sales for premier Impressionist, Modern, and contemporary artworks tallying only US$248.8 million in comparison to US$739 million just a year before, a second round of job cuts began after May 2009.<ref name="BloombergSecondCut"></ref> Guy Bennett resigned just before to the beginning of the summer 2009 sales season.<ref name="Bennett"></ref> Although the economic downturn has encouraged some collectors to sell art, others are unwilling to sell in a market which may yield only bargain prices.<ref name="downturn2" />
=== 2010 onwards ===

With income from classic auctioneering falling, treaty sales made £413.4 million ($665 million) in the first half of 2012, an increase of 53% on the same period last year; they now represent more than 18% of turnover.<ref>Georgina Adam (17 October 2012),

From 2008 until 2013, Christie's charged 25 percent for the first $50,000; 20 percent on the amount between $50,001 and $1 million, and 12 percent on the rest. From 2013, it charged 25 percent for the first $75,000; 20 percent on the next $75,001 to $1.5 million and 12 percent on the rest.<ref>Carol Vogel (18 February 2013), urltoken Christie's Raises Its Commissions for First Time in Five Years The New York Times.</ref>
== Locations ==
Christie's main London saleroom is on King Street in St. James's, where it has been based since 1823. It had a second London saleroom in South Kensington which opened in 1975 and primarily handled the middle market. Christie's permanently closed the South Kensington saleroom in July 2017 as part of their restructuring plans announced March 2017. The closure was due in part to a considerable decrease in sales between 2015 and 2016 in addition to the company expanding its online sales presence.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

Until 2001, Christie's East, a division that sold lower-priced art and objects, was located at 219 East 67th Street. In 1996, Christie's bought a townhouse on East 59th Street in Manhattan as a separate gallery where experts could show clients art in complete privacy to conduct private treaty sales.<ref name="nytimes.com" /> Christie's opened a Beverly Hills salesroom in 1997.<ref>Irene Lacher (2 August 1996), urltoken Christie's Ups the Ante With Beverly Hills Space Los Angeles Times.</ref>

In early 2017, Christie's announced plans to close its secondary South Kensington salesroom at the end of the year and scale back its operation in Amsterdam.<ref name="auto" /> In April 2017, Christie's is to open a 4,500 square feet two-story flagship space in Beverly Hills, California.<ref>Gabriella Angeleti (9 February 2017), urltoken Christie’s to open new flagship location in Los Angeles The Art Newspaper.</ref>

== Christie's Fine Art Storage Services (CFASS) ==
Christie's first ventured into storage services for outside clients in 1984, when it opened a 100,000 square feet brick warehouse in London that was granted "Exempted Status" by HM Revenue and Customs,<ref name="online.wsj.com">Kelly Crow (26 April 2010), urltoken The Ultimate Walk-In Closet: Christie's Offers Art Storage in Brooklyn The Wall Street Journal.</ref> meaning that property may be imported into the United Kingdom and stored without incurring import duties and VAT.
