Foo fighter

== Etymology ==
The nonsense word "foo" emerged in popular culture during the early 1930s, first being used by cartoonist Bill Holman, who peppered his Smokey Stover<ref>See for instance;<br />Holman, "Smokey Stover – A Dead Ringer", Daily News, 21 November 1938, urltoken retrieved 6 Feb 2009,<br />Holman, "Smokey Stover – Movie Idle", Daily News, 23 November 1938, urltoken retrieved 6 Feb 2009.</ref> fireman cartoon strips with "foo" signs and puns.<ref>Moira Davison Reynolds, Comic Strip Artists in American Newspapers, 1945–1980, p. 94, Jefferson, N.C: McFarland & Co., 2003 .</ref><ref>Coulton Waugh, The Comics, p. 316, Univ.

The term "foo" was borrowed from Smokey Stover by a radar operator in the 415th Night Fighter Squadron, Donald J. Meiers, who (it is agreed by most 415th members) gave the foo fighters their name. Meiers was from Chicago and was an avid reader of Holman's strip, which was run daily in the Chicago Tribune. Smokey Stover's catch-phrase was "where there's foo, there's fire". In a mission debriefing on the evening of November 27, 1944, Fritz Ringwald, the unit's S-2 Intelligence Officer, stated that Meiers and Ed Schleuter had sighted a red ball of fire that appeared to chase them through a variety of high-speed maneuvers. Fritz said that Meiers was extremely agitated and had a copy of the comic strip tucked in his back pocket. He pulled it out and slammed it down on Fritz's desk and said, "It was another one of those fuckin' foo fighters!" and stormed out of the debriefing room.<ref name="Jeffery A Lindell 1991">Jeffery A.

According to Ringwald, because of the lack of a better name, it stuck. And this was originally what the men of the 415th started calling these incidents: "fuckin' foo fighters". In December 1944, a press correspondent from the Associated Press in Paris, Bob Wilson, was sent to the 415th at their base outside of Dijon, France, to investigate this story.<ref>New York Times. "Balls of Fire Stalk U.S. Fighters in Night Assaults Over Germany". (A.P.) 2 Jan. 1945. p. 1, 4.</ref> It was at this time that the term was cleaned up to just "foo fighters". The squadron commander, Capt. Harold Augsperger, also decided to sanitize the term to "foo fighters" in the historical data of the squadron.<ref name="Jeffery A Lindell 1991"/>
==History==
Sightings occurred in November 1944, when pilots flying over Western Europe by night reported seeing fast-moving round glowing objects following their aircraft. The objects were variously described as fiery, and glowing red, white, or orange. Some pilots described them as resembling Christmas-tree lights and reported that they seemed to toy with the aircraft, making wild turns before simply vanishing. Pilots and aircrew reported that the objects flew formation with their aircraft and behaved as if they were under intelligent control, but never displayed hostile behavior. However, they could not be outmaneuvered or shot down. The phenomenon was so widespread that the lights earned a name – in the European Theater of Operations they were often called "Kraut fireballs", but for the most part called "foo fighters". The military took the sightings seriously, suspecting that the mysterious sightings might be secret German weapons, but further investigation revealed that German and Japanese pilots had reported similar sightings.<ref></ref>
On 13 December 1944, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force in Paris issued a press release, which was featured in the New York Times the next day, officially describing the phenomenon as a "new German weapon". Follow-up stories, using the term "Foo Fighters", appeared in the New York Herald Tribune and the British Daily Telegraph.<ref></ref>
In its 15 January 1945 edition, Time magazine carried a story entitled "Foo-Fighter", in which it reported that the "balls of fire" had been following USAAF Night fighter for over a month, and that the pilots had named it the "foo-fighter". According to Time, descriptions of the phenomena varied, but the pilots agreed that the mysterious lights followed their aircraft closely at high speed.<ref name=time19450115></ref>
The "balls of fire" phenomenon reported from the Pacific Theater of Operations differed somewhat from the foo fighters reported from Europe; the "ball of fire" resembled a large burning sphere which "just hung in the sky", though it was reported to sometimes follow aircraft. There was speculation that the phenomena could be related to the Japanese fire balloon campaign. As with the European foo fighters, no aircraft were reported as having been attacked by a "ball of fire".<ref></ref>
The postwar Robertson Panel cited foo fighter reports, noting that their behavior did not appear to be threatening, and mentioned possible explanations, for instance that they were electrostatic phenomena similar to St. Elmo's fire, electromagnetic phenomena, or simply reflections of light from ice crystals. The Panel's report suggested that "If the term 'flying saucers' had been popular in 1943–1945, these objects would have been so labeled."<ref name="ufoevidence.org"/>
===Sightings===
Foo fighters were reported on many occasions from around the world; a few examples are noted below.
* Sighting from September 1941 in the Indian Ocean was similar to some later foo fighter reports. From the deck of the S.S. Pułaski (a Poland merchant vessel transporting British troops), two sailors reported a "strange globe glowing with greenish light, about half the size of the full moon as it appears to us."<ref>Clark 1998 p 230</ref> They alerted a British officer, who watched the movements of the object with them for over an hour.
* Charles R. Bastien of the US Eighth Air Force reported one of the first encounters with foo fighters over the Belgium/Netherlands area; he described them as "two fog lights flying at high that could change direction rapidly". During debriefing, his intelligence officer told him that two RAF nightfighters had reported the same thing, and it was later reported in British newspapers.<ref></ref>
*Career U.S. Air Force pilot Duane Adams often related that he had witnessed two occurrences of a bright light which paced his aircraft for about half an hour and then rapidly ascended into the sky. Both incidents occurred at night, both over the South Pacific, and both were witnessed by the entire aircraft crew. The first sighting occurred shortly after the end of World War II while Adams piloted a B-25 bomber. The second sighting occurred in the early 1960s when Adams was piloting a KC-135 tanker.
* Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) pilots spotted a “foo fighter” in the skies of Karachi during a domestic flight PK-304 on Saturday, 26 January 2021 in daylight. According to details, the PIA aircraft was flying at 35,000 feet when the flight captain noticed a white round object above the jet. The flight crew immediately started filming the object and after landing found that similar sightings had been reported in the past across the world. The flight captain said that the round object had a metal ring around it and was emitting white light from the center. He added that it was difficult to determine whether the object was hovering or moving slowly due to relative motion.<ref> urltoken 
==Explanations and theories==
The author Renato Vesco revived the wartime theory that the foo fighters were a Nazi secret weapon in his work Intercept UFO, reprinted in a revised English edition as Man-Made UFOs: 50 Years of Suppression in 1994. Vesco claims that the foo fighters were in fact a form of ground-launched, automatically guided, jet-propelled flak mine called the Feuerball (Fireball). This device, supposedly operated by special SS units, resembled a tortoise shell in shape, and it flew by means of gas jets that spun like a Catherine wheel around the fuselage. Miniature klystron tubes inside the device, in combination with the gas jets, created the characteristic glowing spheroid appearance of the foo fighters. A crude form of collision avoidance radar ensured the craft would not crash into another airborne object, and an onboard sensor mechanism would even instruct the machine to depart swiftly if it was fired upon. The purpose of the Feuerball, according to Vesco, was twofold. The appearance of this weird device inside a bomber stream would (and indeed did) have a distracting and disruptive effect on the bomber pilots. Also, Vesco alleges that the devices were also intended to have an "offensive" capability. Electrostatic discharges from the klystron tubes would, he stated, interfere with the ignition systems of the bombers, causing the engines to stall and the planes to crash. Although there is no hard evidence to support the reality of the Feuerball drone, this theory has been taken up by other aviation/ufology authors, and it has even been cited by some as the most likely explanation for the phenomena in at least one recent TV "documentary" on Wunderwaffen.<ref>Renato Vesco, David Hatcher Childress, Man-made UFOs 1944–1994: 50 years of suppression, Adventures Unlimited Press, 1994 .</ref><ref>Renato Vesco, Intercept UFO, Pinnacle Books, 1974 .</ref> Although others cite the single–sourced nature of the claims, the complete lack of evidence supporting them, and the implausible capabilities of the supposed device as nonsense. <ref>The Nazi UFO Mythos urltoken The Nazi UFO Mythos: An Investigation

Any type of electrical discharge from the wings of airplanes (see St. Elmo's Fire) has been suggested as an explanation, since it has been known to appear at the wingtips of aircraft.<ref name=time19450115/> It has also been pointed out that some of the descriptions of foo fighters closely resemble those of ball lightning.<ref></ref>
During April 1945, the U.S. Navy began to experiment on visual illusions as experienced by nighttime aviators. This work began the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Medicine (BUMED) project X-148-AV-4-3. This project pioneered the study of aviators' vertigo and was initiated because a wide variety of anomalous events were being reported by nighttime aviators.<ref>"The Real Foo Fighters: A Historical and Physiological Perspective on a World War II Aviation Mystery". Skeptic Magazine, vol. 17, no. 2 (pp. 38–43)</ref> Dr. Edgar Vinacke, who was the prime flight psychologist on this project, summarized the need for a cohesive and systemic outline of the epidemiology of aviators' vertigo:

== Notes ==

The term "foo fighter" was used by Allied aircraft pilots during World War II to describe various UFOs or mysterious aerial phenomena seen in the skies over both the European and Pacific theaters of operations.
Though "foo fighter" initially described a type of UFO reported and named by the U.S. 415th Night Fighter Squadron, the term was also commonly used to mean any UFO sighting from that period.<ref name=toomey></ref> Formally reported from November 1944 onwards, witnesses often assumed that the foo fighters were secret weapons employed by the enemy.
