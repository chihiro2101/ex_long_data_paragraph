Jing Ke

==Background==
In 230 BC, the Qin state began conquering other states Qin's wars of unification. Qin's army successfully annihilated the weakest of the Seven Warring States, Han. Two years later Zhao was also conquered.<ref name="gongtong70">王恆偉. (2005) (2006) 中國歷史講堂 #2 戰國 秦 漢. 中華書局. . pp. 70-71.</ref>
In exchange for peace, King Xi of Yan had earlier forced his son Crown Prince Dan to be held hostage by the Qin, but Prince Dan returned knowing that Qin was far stronger than Yan and would attack it sooner or later.<ref name="gongtong70" />
Jing Ke originally came from the Wei (state).<ref></ref> He was a scholar, proficient in the art of the sword. His homeland of Wei was absorbed by Qin, and Jing Ke fled to Yan.<ref name="gongtong70" /> A youxia named Tian Guang (田光) first introduced him to Prince Dan.<ref>曹正文. 1998 (1998). 俠客行: 縱談中國武俠. 知書房出版集團 publishing. , . p. 27.</ref> There Jing Ke accepted the hospitality of Prince Dan, who as a last resort decided to send an assassin against the King of Qin.<ref name="gongtong70" /> The plan involved either kidnapping the king and forcing him to release the territories from his control; or failing this, killing him.<ref name="gongtong70" /> The expectation in either case was that Qin would be left disorganized, enabling the other six major states to unite against it.<ref name="gongtong70" />
== Assassination plot ==
=== The plan ===
In 228 BC, the Qin army was already at the Zhao capital of Handan, and was waiting to approach the state of Yan. Jing Ke agreed to go to Qin and pretend to be a nobleman begging for mercy.<ref name="gongtong70" /> According to events at the time, Dukang (督亢) (in present-day Hebei Province) was the first part of the Yan state that the Qin wanted, by reason of its fertile farmland.<ref name="gongtong70" /> The plan was to present as gifts the map of Dukang<ref name="gongtong70" /> and the severed head of the traitorous Qin general Fan Wuji<ref name="gongtong70" /> to the king of Qin, in order to approach him.
At the time, General Fan Wuji had lost favor with Qin and wanted revenge against it;<ref name="gongtong72">王恆偉. (2005) (2006) 中國歷史講堂 #2 戰國 秦 漢. 中華書局. . pp. 72-73.</ref> whereas the Qin state put a bounty on capturing him of 1,000 gold pieces.<ref name="tonsi62">戴逸, 龔書鐸. 2002 (2003) 中國通史. 春秋 戰國 秦. Intelligence press. . p. 62.</ref> Jing Ke went to Fan himself to discuss the assassination plan. Fan Wuji believed that the plan would work, and agreed to commit suicide so that his head could be collected.<ref name="gongtong72" /><ref name="tonsi62" />
Prince Dan then obtained the sharpest possible dagger, refined it with poison, and gave it to Jing Ke.<ref name="gongtong72" /> To accompany him, Prince Dan assigned Qin Wuyang as his assistant.<ref name="gongtong72" /> Qin Wuyang was known to have successfully committed murder at the age of 13.<ref name="gongtong72" />
In 227 BC, Prince Dan and other guests wore white clothing and white hats at the Yi River (易水) to send the pair of assassins off.<ref name="gongtong72" /> Jing Ke reportedly sang a song "the wind blows, the river freezes. The hero fords, never to return!" (風蕭蕭兮易水寒，壯士一去兮不復還).<ref name="gongtong72" /> The King of Qin received the message of visitors presenting a gift to him, and was willing to receive them at the city.<ref name="gongtong72" />
=== Assassination attempt ===
Concealing the dagger inside the map scroll, Jing Ke and Qin Wuyang represented the Yan as ambassadors and met with King Zheng.<ref name="gongtong72" /> Qin Wuyang reportedly became so nervous that he acted almost paralyzed when entering the palace, and Jing Ke managed the excuse that his partner had never set eyes on the grace of Son of Heaven.<ref name="sima">Sima Qian. Dawson, Raymond Stanley. Brashier, K. E. (2007). The First Emperor: Selections from the Historical Records. Oxford University Press. , . pp. 15-20, 82, 99.</ref> Other sources suggest Jing Ke described Qin Wuyang as a rural boy who had never seen the world and was suffering a cultural shock.<ref name="gongtong72" /> The panicked Qin Wuyang was then barred from moving up the palace, and Jing Ke was ordered to present the map alone.
Jing Ke approached King Zheng and politely presented the map scroll. When the King Zheng unrolled the map, Jing Ke immediately seized the revealed dagger, grabbed the king's clothes and attacked him, who somehow managed to back away from the initial thrust by tearing off a sleeve in the process. While King Zheng fled from his attacker on foot, he attempted to draw his own sword hanging from his belt, but was unable to do so while running desperately as it was a very long ceremonial sword. None of the other Qin officials within the vicinity were armed and able to stop Jing Ke, and the guards were all stationed outside the palace and were unable to immediately reach the scene.<ref name="gongtong72" /> In the confusion Jing Ke began to close in on the king, who struggled to get away from the assassin by circling behind a pillar.
Seeing the king in grave danger, a royal physician named Xia Wuju (夏無且) grabbed his own medicine bag and hurled it at Jing Ke,<ref name="gongtong72" /> which slowed down the assassin just enough to allow King Zheng to recover some distance. Reminded by cries from other officials, the king managed to shift his longsword behind his back and unsheathe it over the shoulder. Now armed, he immediately turned back and struck Jing Ke in the thigh, effectively immobilizing him.<ref name="gongtong74">王恆偉. (2005) (2006) 中國歷史講堂 #2 戰國 秦 漢. 中華書局. . pp. 74-75.</ref> The injured Jing Ke, out of a desperate last attempt, threw his dagger towards King Zheng, only to miss the target. The king then proceeded to stab Jing Ke eight more times, mortally wounding him. Knowing it was hopelessly over, the dying Jing Ke sat with his legs stretched forward (jījù), a manner then considered very rude, and used the last of his strength to taunt King Zheng with abuses. At this point, the guards had arrived at the scene to finish off both Jing Ke and the fleeing Qin Wuyang.<ref name="gongtong74" />
It was recorded that right after the incident, King Zheng sat on his throne catatonically holding the sword, due to the exhaustion caused by the adrenaline rush, before he finally recovered after a short while and thanked the physician Xia Wuju for attempting to stop the assassin.
==Yan annihilation==
After Jing Ke's attempt, the Qin army general Wang Jian was sent against the Yan state. In 226 BC, Prince Dan sent his army to fight at Ji (薊),<ref name="gongtong74" /> but were soon defeated. In an effort to try to appease the King of Qin, King Xi of Yan put his son to death; however, the Yan were annexed nonetheless and the Yan were destroyed.<ref name="gongtong74" />
