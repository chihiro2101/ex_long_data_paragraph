Richard Ford

==Early life==
Ford was born in Jackson, Mississippi, the only son of Parker Carrol and Edna Ford. Parker was a traveling salesman for Faultless Starch, a Kansas City company. Of his mother, Ford said, "Her ambition was to be, first, in love with my father and, second, to be a full-time mother." When Ford was eight years old, his father had a severe heart failure, and thereafter Ford spent as much time with his grandfather, a former prizefighter and hotel owner in Little Rock, Arkansas, as he did with his parents in Mississippi.<ref name="Guagliardo 2001, p.xiii">Guagliardo 2001, p.xiii.</ref> Ford's father died of a second heart attack in 1960. In Jackson, Ford lived across the street from the home of author Eudora Welty.<ref></ref>
Ford's grandfather had worked for a railroad. At the age of 19, before deciding to attend college, Ford began work on the Missouri Pacific train line as a locomotive engineer's assistant, learning the work while doing the job.<ref></ref>
Ford received a B.A. degree from Michigan State University. Having enrolled to study hotel management, he switched to English. After graduating, he taught junior high school in Flint, Michigan, and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps but was discharged after contracting hepatitis. At university he met Kristina Hensley, his future wife; they married in 1968.<ref name="Guagliardo 2001, p.xiii"/>
Despite mild dyslexia, Ford developed a serious interest in literature. He has stated in interviews that his dyslexia may have helped him as a reader, as it forced him to read books slowly and thoughtfully.<ref></ref>
Ford briefly attended law school but quit and participated with the creative writing program at the University of California, Irvine, to pursue a Master of Fine Arts degree, which he received in 1970. Ford chose this course simply because "they admitted me. I remember getting the application for Iowa, and thinking they'd never have let me in. I'm sure I was right about that, too. But, typical of me, I didn't know who was teaching at Irvine. I didn't know it was important to know such things. I wasn't the most curious of young men, even though I give myself credit for not letting that deter me." Actually, Oakley Hall and E. L. Doctorow were teaching there, and Ford has acknowledged that they influenced him.<ref name="Ploughshares profile">This citation is now only available in its via the Web Archive.

==Early career==
Ford published his first novel, A Piece of My Heart,<ref></ref> the story of two unlikely drifters whose paths cross on an island in the Mississippi River, during 1976, and followed it with The Ultimate Good Luck during 1981. During the interim he briefly taught at Williams College and Princeton University.<ref name="Guagliardo 2001, p.xiii"/> Despite good notices the books sold little, and Ford retired from fiction writing to become a writer for the New York magazine Inside Sports. "I realized," Ford said, "there was probably a wide gulf between what I could do and what would succeed with readers. I felt that I'd had a chance to write two novels, and neither of them had really created much stir, so maybe I should find real employment, and earn my keep."<ref name="Ploughshares profile"/>
During 1982, the magazine was terminated, and when Sports Illustrated did not hire Ford, he resumed writing fiction, composing The Sportswriter,<ref></ref> a novel about a failed novelist turned sportswriter who undergoes an emotional crisis after the death of his son. The novel became Ford's first well-known publication, named one of Time magazine's five best books of 1986 and a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction.<ref name="Ploughshares profile"/> Ford followed the success immediately with Rock Springs (1987),<ref></ref> a story collection mostly set in Montana, includes some of his most popular stories.
Reviewers and literary critics associated the stories in Rock Springs with the aesthetic style known as "dirty realism". This term referred to a group of authors during the 1970s and 1980s that included Raymond Carver and Tobias Wolff—- two writers with whom Ford was well acquainted—- along with Ann Beattie, Frederick Barthelme, Larry Brown, and Jayne Anne Phillips, among others.<ref></ref> Those applying this label refer to Carver's lower-middle-class subjects or the protagonists Ford portrays in Rock Springs. However, many of the characters of the novels about Frank Bascombe (The Sportswriter, Independence Day, The Lay of the Land, and Let Me Be Frank With You), notably the protagonist himself, enjoy degrees of material affluence and cultural capital not normally associated with dirty realism.
==Mid-career and acclaim==
His 1990 novel Wildlife, a story of a Montana golf professional turned firefighter, met with mixed reviews and middling sales, but by the end of the 1990s Ford was well known. He was increasingly sought after as an editor and contributor to various projects. Ford edited the 1990 The Best American Series, the 1992 Granta Book of the American Short Story, the Fall 1996 "fiction issue" of Ploughshares,<ref></ref> and the 1998 Granta Book of the American Long Story. In the latter volume's "Introduction," Ford stipulated that he preferred the designation "long story" instead of term "novella." For the publishing project Library of America, Ford edited a two-volume edition of the selected works of the Mississippi writer Eudora Welty, which was published during 1998.
During 1995, Ford published the novel Independence Day, a sequel to The Sportswriter, featuring the continued story of its protagonist, Frank Bascombe. Reviews were positive, and the novel became the first to win both the PEN/Faulkner Award<ref name="Penfaulkner.org"></ref> and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.<ref name="Pulitzer Prize citation"></ref> During the same year, Ford was chosen as winner of the Rea Award for the Short Story, for outstanding achievement for that genre.<ref name="Rea Award citation"></ref> He ended the 1990s with a well-received collection of short stories, Women With Men, published during 1997. The Paris Review termed him a "master" of the short story genre.<ref></ref>
==Later life and writings==
Ford lived for many years in New Orleans in the French Quarter, on lower Bourbon Street, and then in the Garden District of the same city, where his wife, Kristina, was the executive director of the city planning commission. He now lives in Maine in East Boothbay.<ref></ref> During the intervening years, Ford lived in other locations, usually in the United States, as he pursued a peripatetic teaching career.
He obtained a teaching appointment at Bowdoin College during 2005 but kept the job for only one semester.<ref></ref> During 2008 Ford was an adjunct professor of the Oscar Wilde Centre with the School of English at Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland, teaching in the Masters programme in creative writing.<ref></ref> Starting December 29, 2010, Ford assumed the job of senior fiction professor at the University of Mississippi during the autumn of 2011, replacing Barry Hannah, who died during March 2010. During the autumn of 2012, he became the Emmanuel Roman and Barrie Sardoff Roman Professor of the Humanities and Professor of Writing at the Columbia University School of the Arts.<ref></ref>
As the new century commenced, he published another story collection, A Multitude of Sins (2002), followed by the novels The Lay Of The Land, the third Bascombe novel published during 2006, and Canada, published during May 2012.<ref></ref> According to Ford, The Lay Of The Land completed his series of Bascombe novels, but Canada was a stand-alone novel. However, during April 2013, Ford read from a new Frank Bascombe story without revealing to the audience whether it was part of a longer work.<ref></ref> By 2014, it was confirmed that the story was to appear in the book Let Me Be Frank With You, published during November of that year.<ref></ref> The latter is a work consisting of four interconnected novellas (or "long stories": I'm Here, Everything Could Be Worse, The New Normal and Deaths of Others), all narrated by Frank Bascombe.<ref name="lyceumagency.com"> urltoken Richard Ford, Lyceum Agency, 2014</ref> Let Me Be Frank With You was a finalist for the 2015 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction. It did not win the prize, but the selection committee praised the book for its "unflinching series of narratives, set in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, insightfully portraying a society in decline."<ref name="pulitzer.org"> urltoken "The 2015 Pulitzer Prize Finalist in Fiction", The Pulitzer Prizes.</ref>
Also, as he did in the preceding decade, Ford continued to assist with various editing projects. During 2007, he edited the New Granta Book of the American Short Story, and in 2011 he edited Blue Collar, White Collar, No Collar: Stories of Work. During May 2017, Ford published a memoir, Between Them: Remembering My Parents.<ref></ref>
In 2018, Wildlife was adapted into a Wildlife (film) by director Paul Dano and screenwriter Zoe Kazan. It was released to widespread critical acclaim.
==Critical opinion==
Ford's writing demonstrates "a meticulous concern for the nuances of language . and the rhythms of phrases and sentences". Ford has described his sense of language as "a source of pleasure in itself—- all of its corporeal qualities, its syncopations, moods, sounds, the way things look on the page". Besides this "devotion to language" is what he terms "the fabric of affection that holds people close enough together to survive."<ref>Guagliardo 2001, p.vii.</ref>
Comparisons have been drawn between Ford's work and the writings of John Updike, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and Walker Percy. Ford resists such comparisons, commenting, "You can't write . on the strength of influence. You can only write a good story or a good novel by yourself."<ref>Guagliardo 2001, p. xi.</ref>
Ford's works of fiction "dramatize the breakdown of such cultural institutions as marriage, family, and community," and his "marginalized protagonists often typify the rootlessness and nameless longing . pervasive in a highly mobile, present-oriented society in which individuals, having lost a sense of the past, relentlessly pursue their own elusive identities in the here and now."<ref>Guagliardo 2000, p. xiv.</ref> Ford "looks to art, rather than religion, to provide consolation and redemption in a chaotic time."<ref>Guagliardo 2000, p. xvi.</ref>
==Controversies==
Ford once sent Alice Hoffman a copy of one of her books with bullet holes in it after she angered him by unfavorably reviewing The Sportswriter.<ref></ref>
In 2004, Ford spat on Colson Whitehead when encountering him at a party two years after Whitehead published a negative review of A Multitude of Sins, resulting in speculation that the incident may have been racially motivated rather than a matter of critical differences.<ref></ref> Thirteen years later after spitting in his colleague's face, Ford remained unrepentant, writing in Esquire in 2017, "as of today, I don’t feel any different about Mr. Whitehead, or his review, or my response."<ref></ref>
