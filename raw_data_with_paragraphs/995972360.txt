His poetic works were praised by fellow writers including Yasunari Kawabata and Yukio Mishima.<ref name="album"></ref> Today his works are admired for their finely tuned self-observation and descriptive power.
Despite the limited body of work he created during his short lifetime, Kajii has managed to leave a lasting footprint on Japanese culture. "Lemon" is a staple of literature textbooks.<ref name=kojima/> According to a report in major daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun, many high school students have emulated the protagonist's defiant act of leaving a lemon in the book section of Maruzen, a department store chain.<ref name=kojima>"&nbsp;I read an article about Maruzen closing its business in yesterday's Asahi Journal Evening Edition. It claims that many people are leaving lemons in the department store, just like the main character in Motojiro Kajii's short story titled LEMON. Coincidentally, I learned that many people are buying LEMON from the bookstore inside Maruzen. LEMON is featured in school textbooks; there aren't many Japanese who don't know the story. I am fond of the story myself. I learned the name Maruzen for the first time through LEMON. To be perfectly honest. I left a lemon in Maruzen when I was a high school student. My friend did the same. It must have been a nuisance for the people who worked there.&nbsp;" – Hideo Kojima (creator of the Metal Gear Solid video games for Konami), in the </ref><ref>"&nbsp;On October 10 Maruzen will close their Kyoto shop which is associated with this novel Lemon. After they announced their closure, store staff found lemons on the books. They had lemons before a few times in a year, but this year they have found 11 lemons already.&nbsp;" – Mari Kanazawa (notable Tokyo blogger), in the urltoken Monday, October 03, 2005 entry "A lemon on books" of her English blog "Watashi to Tokyo – Me and Tokyo"</ref> The opening line of "Under the Cherry Trees" (Dead bodies are buried under the cherry trees!) is popularly quoted<ref name="loveletter"> urltoken "Why is the Cherry Blossom (Sakura) cherished?" </ref> in reference to hanami, the Japanese custom of cherry blossom viewing.
