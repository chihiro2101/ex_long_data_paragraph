Gabriel

===Gabriel's horn===
The trope of Gabriel blowing a trumpet blast to indicate the Lord's return to Earth is especially familiar in Spirituals. However, though the Bible mentions a trumpet blast preceding the resurrection of the dead, it never specifies Gabriel as the trumpeter. Different passages state different things: the angels of the Son of Man (Matthew 24:31); the voice of the Son of God (John 5:25-29); God's trumpet (I Thessalonians 4:16); seven angels sounding a series of blasts (Revelation 8-11); or simply "a trumpet will sound" (I Corinthians 15:52).<ref name="svm">S. Vernon McCasland, "Gabriel's Trumpet", Journal of Bible and Religion 9:3:159–161 (August 1941) </ref>
In related traditions, Gabriel is again not identified as the trumpeter. In Judaism, trumpets are prominent, and they seem to be blown by God himself, or sometimes Michael. In Zoroastrianism, there is no trumpeter at the last judgment. In Islamic tradition, it is Israfil who blows the trumpet, though he is not named in the Qur'an. The Christian Church Fathers do not mention Gabriel as the trumpeter; early English literature similarly does not.<ref name="svm"/>
The earliest known identification of Gabriel as the trumpeter comes in John Wycliffe's 1382 tract, De Ecclesiæ Dominio.<ref></ref> In the year 1455, in Armenian art, there is an illustration in an Armenian manuscript showing Gabriel sounding his trumpet as the dead climb out of their graves.<ref>Walters MS 543, fol. 14.</ref> Two centuries later, Gabriel is identified as the trumpeter, in John Milton's Paradise Lost (1667):<ref name="svm"/><ref>Milton, Paradise Lost, XI.72ff</ref>
<blockquote><poem>
Betwixt these rockie pillars Gabriel sat
Chief of the Angelic guards (IV.545f).
He ended, and the Son gave signal high
To the bright minister that watch'd, he blew
His trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps
When God descended, and perhaps once more
To sound at general doom. (XI.72ff).
</poem></blockquote>
Later, Gabriel's horn is omnipresent in Negro spirituals, but it is unclear how the Byzantine conception inspired Milton and the spirituals, though they presumably have a common source.<ref name="svm"/>
Gabriel's horn also makes an appearance in The Eyes of Texas (1903) in which it signifies the rapture.<ref></ref> In Marc Connelly's play based on spirituals, The Green Pastures (1930), Gabriel has his beloved trumpet constantly with him, and the Lord has to warn him not to blow it too soon.<ref name="svm" /> Four years later "Blow, Gabriel, Blow" was introduced by Ethel Merman in Cole Porter's Anything Goes (1934).
===Feast days===
Saint Gabriel the Archangel's festival day was exclusively celebrated on 18 March according to many sources dating between 1588 and 1921; unusually, a source published in 1856<ref></ref> has the feast celebrated on 7 April for unknown reasons (a note in parentheses states that the day is normally celebrated on 18 March). Writer Elizabeth Drayson mentions the feast being celebrated on 18 March 1588 in her 2013 book "The Lead Books of Granada".<ref></ref>
One of the oldest out of print sources placing the feast on 18 March, first published in 1608, is "Flos sanctorum: historia general de la vida y hechos de Jesu-Christo.y de los santos de que reza y haze fiesta la Iglesia Catholica." by the Spain writer Alonso de Villegas; a newer edition of this book was published in 1794.<ref></ref> Another source published in Ireland in 1886 the Irish Ecclesiastical Record also mentions 18 March.<ref></ref> There is a painting from 1886 by the Italian artist Diodore Rahoult, on which 18 March also appears.<ref></ref>
The feast of Saint Gabriel was included by Pope Benedict XV in the General Roman Calendar in 1921, for celebration on 24 March.<ref>Butler's Lives of the saints, vol. 1, edited by Herbert Thurston and Donald Attwater, Christian Classics, 1981 </ref> In 1969 the day was officially transferred to 29 September for celebration in conjunction with the feast of the archangels St. Michael and St. Raphael.<ref>Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 119</ref> The Church of England has also adopted the 29 September date, known as Michaelmas.
The Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite celebrate his feast day on 8 November (for those churches that follow the traditional Julian Calendar, 8 November currently falls on 21 November of the modern Gregorian Calendar, a difference of 13 days). Eastern Orthodox commemorate him, not only on his November feast, but also on two other days: 26 March is the "Synaxis of the Archangel Gabriel" and celebrates his role in the Annunciation.
13 July is also known as the "Synaxis of the Archangel Gabriel", and celebrates all the appearances and miracles attributed to Gabriel throughout history. The feast was first established on Mount Athos when, in the 9th century, during the reign of Emperor Basil II and the Empress Constantina Porphyrogenitus and while Nicholas Chrysoverges was Patriarch of Constantinople, the Archangel appeared in a cell<ref></ref> near Karyes, where he wrote with his finger on a stone tablet the hymn to the Theotokos, "Axion Estin".<ref></ref>
The Coptic Orthodox Church celebrates his feast on 13 Paoni,<ref></ref> 22 Koiak and 26 Paoni.<ref></ref>
The Ethiopian Church celebrates his feast on 28 December, with a sizeable number of its believers making a pilgrimage to a church dedicated to "Saint Gabriel" in Kulubi on that day.<ref>Nega Mezlekia, Notes from the Hyena's Belly: An Ethiopian Childhood (New York: Picador, 2000), p. 266. .</ref>
Additionally, Gabriel is the patron saint of messengers, those who work for broadcasting and telecommunications such as radio and television, postal workers, clerics, diplomats, and stamp collectors.<ref name=Guiley2004p140></ref>
===Latter-day Saint teachings===
In Latter-day Saint theology, Gabriel is believed to have lived a mortal life as the prophet Noah. The two are regarded as the same individual; Noah being his mortal name and Gabriel being his heavenly name.<ref name=":1">.</ref><ref name=":2" />

Though alternate theories exist, whether the occurrence of the Holy Spirit in the Quran refers to Gabriel or not, remains an issue of scholarly debate. In the Quran, Gabriel appears named in and , as well as in , where he is mentioned along with Michael (Mika'il).
Muslims also revere Gabriel for a number of historical events predating the first revelation, found in the Quran. Muslims believe that Gabriel was the angel who informed Zachariah of John's birth, as well as Mary of the future nativity of Jesus;<ref>Ibn Kathir.

The eccentric English hagiography and antiquarian, Sabine Baring-Gould (1834–1924) wrote "Gabriel's Message", the English translation of the Basque Christmas carol Birjina gaztetto bat zegoen. The original charol is likely related to the 13th or 14th-century Latin chant Angelus ad virginem, which itself is based on the biblical account of the Annunciation in the Gospel of Luke.
In "My Own Prison" by Creed, Gabriel is mentioned as deciphering the visions to the main character in the song.
"Sugar Baby", the last track on Bob Dylan's Love and Theft album, contains this reference:

Daniel 8:15 describes Gabriel as appearing in the "likeness of man" and in Daniel 9:21 he is referred to as "the man Gabriel." David Everson observes that "such anthropomorphic descriptions of an angel are consistent with previous.descriptions of angels," as in Genesis 19:5.<ref name=everson></ref>
Gabriel is most often portrayed in the context of scenes of the Annunciation. In 2008 a 16th-century drawing by Lucas van Leyden of the Netherlands was discovered. George R. Goldner, chairman of the department of prints and drawings at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, suggested that the sketch was for a stained glass window. "The fact that the archangel is an ordinary-looking person and not an idealized boy is typical of the artist", said Goldner.<ref>Vogel, Carol. 25 July 2008.
