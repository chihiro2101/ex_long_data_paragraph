Lewis & Clark College

==History==
Like many modern universities, the institution that would eventually become Lewis & Clark was initially intended to provide secondary as well as higher education for a specific religious community, in this case Presbyterian pioneers in Oregon's Willamette Valley. To this end the Presbyterian church incorporated Albany Academy in 1858,<ref name=Oregon>Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956.</ref> making Lewis & Clark one of four Oregon colleges with foundations predating Oregon's statehood (along with Willamette University, Pacific University, and Linfield University).
Within a decade of its founding, Albany Academy began to focus more exclusively on higher education, changing its official name to the Albany Collegiate Institution in 1866. Lewis & Clark's official founding date comes from the current charter, which has been legally valid since the Presbyterian church reincorporated the Albany Collegiate Institution as Albany College in 1867.<ref name=Oregon/> Unlike most Oregon colleges of the pioneer era, the college has been coeducational since the first class, which graduated in 1873. The early campus of in Albany was situated on land donated by the Monteith family. In 1892, the original school building was enlarged, and in 1925 the school relocated south of Albany where it remained until 1937.<ref name=Oregon/>
Albany College established a junior college to the north in Portland in 1934, with the entire school moving to Portland in 1939.<ref name=Oregon/> The former campus grounds later became home to the federal government's Albany Research Center.<ref></ref> In 1942 the college trustees acquired the Lloyd Frank (of the historic Portland department store Meier & Frank) "Fir Acres" estate in southwest Portland, and the school name was changed to Lewis & Clark College.<ref name=Oregon/> The original school mascot, the Pirates, was changed to the Pioneers in 1946.

Lewis & Clark maintains 9 male and 10 female varsity sports teams, and athletic facilities including Pamplin Sports Center and Griswold Stadium.<ref></ref>

The Pioneers compete mainly in the Northwest Conference against eight other NCAA Division&nbsp;III institutions in the Pacific Northwest. One in five undergraduates are officially designated student athletes.<ref></ref>
Recent accomplishments in varsity athletics include the men's rowing team winning its conference, women's swim team winning third in conference, and men's and women's basketball both earning third in conference.<ref></ref>
In the 2011 season, the women's cross-country team placed seventh at West regionals, with the men's team placing 13th.<ref></ref>

A large number of smaller club and intramural sports such as Rugby, Ultimate (sport),<ref></ref>
and Boffing<ref></ref> enjoy broad participation. Lewis & Clark students have invented several intramural competitive sports, including Ninja<ref></ref> and Wolvetch,<ref name="Wolvetch Crawls on All Fours"></ref> which are popular at Lewis & Clark but seldom played elsewhere. While some varsity athletic events are well attended, there has long been tension between varsity athletes and non-athletes regarding perceived social and cultural differences, as well as the substantial financial support varsity sports teams enjoy.<ref></ref><ref name="Athletics giveaway sparks controversy among LC students"></ref>
