O'Leary challenged the way the department had traditionally been run, particularly its focus on developing and testing nuclear weapons.

McCurry called the project "unacceptable."<ref name="Warren, James, O'Leary's Legacy" /> O'Leary claimed the allocation was made without her direct knowledge and defended the research as an attempt to study the efficacy of the department's messaging.<ref name="Lewis, Neil, monitor reporters"></ref> A Government Accountability Office audit of travel criticized her for traveling too frequently and spending excessively on accommodations.<ref></ref><ref></ref> She apologized to Congressional committees in 1996 for spending that exceeded limits on the funds appropriated to the agency for travel.<ref name="Ford, Lynne E."></ref>

On July 13, 2004, O'Leary was selected and began work as President of her undergraduate alma mater, Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee.<ref name="2003 Office of Fisk President"></ref><ref name="O'Leary 14th President"></ref> She was officially installed as the university's 14th president on October6, 2005.<ref></ref> Before O'Leary's tenure, the university had tried unsuccessfully to increase its enrollment and experienced financial problems.<ref name="Schelzig, Erik"></ref> In 2008 Fisk had an enrollment of 770 students and 264 faculty and staff members.<ref></ref><ref name="Greenberg, Pierce, Financially challenged Fisk"></ref> 
 By 2011 Fisk's enrollment numbers improved,<ref name="Greenberg, Pierce, Financially challenged Fisk" /> but the school was still operating with a loss in six of the previous nine years.<ref name="Greenberg, Pierce, Financially challenged Fisk" /> These ongoing financial problems caused the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to place Fisk on probation in 2010 over concerns for the university's finances and prospects.<ref name="Stuart, Reginald"></ref><ref name="jbhe, O'Leary to Retire"></ref> The probation ended in December 2013.<ref name="Stuart, Reginald" />
Under O'Leary's leadership, Fisk went to court in December 2005 seeking a ruling that it could sell a portion of the university's Alfred Stieglitz Collection.<ref name="Brooks, Jennifer, Can Selling O'Keefe"></ref><ref name="Schelzig, Erik" /> Stieglitz's widow Georgia O'Keeffe had bequeathed the collection to Fisk with restrictions on its sale. At the time the deal was finalized, O'Leary said the arrangement was essential to keeping the university open.<ref name="Tamburin, Adam, leader justifies 2010 sale"></ref>
Amidst the public battle over attempts to sell the Alfred Stieglitz Collection, O'Leary quietly arranged to sell two other works of art, including a work by Florine Stettheimer. Fisk's board of trustees approved the sale in 2010 although it was not publicly disclosed until The New York Times reported it in 2016. O'Leary defended the decision to sell the artwork, saying it was done out of necessity amid financial difficulties.<ref name="Tamburin, Adam, leader justifies 2010 sale" />

Hazel Reid O'Leary (born May 17, 1937) was the seventh United States Secretary of Energy, from 1993 to 1997, appointed by President Bill Clinton. She was the first woman and first African American to hold the position. She served as president of Fisk University, a historically black college and her alma mater, from 2004 to 2013. O'Leary's tenure at Fisk came amid financial difficulty for the school, during which time she increased enrollment and contentiously used school's art collection to raise funds.
O'Leary received her bachelor's degree from Fisk before earning her Bachelor of Laws degree from Rutgers Law School. O'Leary worked as a prosecutor in New Jersey and then in a private consulting/accounting firm before joining the Carter Administration. O'Leary returned to the private sector and rejoined the government as the first Secretary of Energy of the Clinton administration. As Secretary of Energy, O'Leary declassified documents detailing how the United States had previously conducted secret testing on the effects of radiation on unsuspecting American citizens. O'Leary received criticism for her excessive spending as Secretary.
