==Invention of Gatorade==
In 1965, Cade was approached by Dewayne Douglas, an assistant coach for the Florida Gators football team, about the extreme dehydration faced by Gator football players practicing in the high temperatures and humidity of the Deep South in late summer and early fall.<ref name=mcleod8142005>Michael McLeod, " urltoken Gator-made," Orlando Sentinel (August 14, 2005). Retrieved February 17, 2010.</ref> Douglas questioned Cade why his football players did not urinate during practice and games.<ref name=mcleod8142005/> Cade learned from anecdotal evidence that football players were losing water through perspiration and failing to replace fluid during practice and games.<ref name=mcleod8142005/> Cade's research team discovered that football players were losing up to 18 pounds (8.2 kilograms) during the three hours of a college football game, and that ninety to ninety-five percent of that loss was water.<ref name=ap11272007/> A player's plasma volume could decrease as much as seven percent and blood volume by five percent, and sodium and chloride were excreted in the sweat.<ref name=ap11272007/>
During 1965 and 1966, Cade, together with his team of research doctors Dana Shires, James Free, and Alejandro M. de Quesada, conducted a series of trial-and-error experiments with his glucose-and-electrolytes rehydration drink on members of the Gators football team of coach Ray Graves, first with members of the freshman squad, and after initially promising results, with starting members of the varsity team.<ref name=han2242003/> "It didn't taste like Gatorade," Cade said in a 1988 interview with Florida Trend magazine.<ref name=martin11282007/> In fact, according to Cade, when Gators lineman Larry Gagner first tried it, he spat it out and strongly suggested that the original experimental formula tasted more like bodily waste.<ref name=martin11282007/><ref>Proctor, urltoken Cade Interview, pp. 68–69.</ref> Dana Shires remembered that "it sort of tasted like toilet bowl cleaner."<ref name=times11292007>" urltoken Robert Cade: Scientist who invented Gatorade, the world's first and biggest-selling sports drink," The Times (November 29, 2007).

Gatorade achieved national prominence as a result of the Gators' first Orange Bowl title over the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in January 1967.<ref name=times11292007/> The Gators reinforced their reputation as a "second-half team" and came from behind to defeat the Yellow Jackets 27–10.<ref>College Football Data Warehouse, All-Time Coaching Records, urltoken Ray Graves 1966 .

James Robert Cade (September 26, 1927 – November 27, 2007) was an American physician, university professor, research scientist and inventor. Cade, a native of Texas, earned his bachelor and medical degrees at the University of Texas, and became a professor of medicine and nephrology at the University of Florida. Although Cade engaged in many areas of medical research, he is most widely remembered as the leader of the research team that created the sports drink Gatorade.<ref name=han2242003>Arline Phillips-Han, " urltoken Dr. Robert Cade . . . saga of the world's best-selling sports drink and the creative physician scientist behind it," Health Science Center News, University of Florida (February 24, 2003). Retrieved December 10, 2014.</ref> Gatorade would have significant medical applications for treating dehydration in patients, and has generated over $150 million in royalties for the university.
In his later years, Cade became a prominent philanthropist, donating significant sums to charities affiliated with the Lutheran Church, creating scholarships and donating freely to the University of Florida and other colleges and universities, and endowing his own charitable foundations.
