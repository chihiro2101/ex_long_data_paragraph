Cross-platform interchange

==Types==
===Between one line with continuous track but no overlapping services===
Kirkby railway station (until 1977) and Ormskirk railway station (until 1970) were double-track railway, when they were converted into single-track railway with cross-platform interchange separated by buffers but on the same track alignment.
===Between different lines===
Common cross-platform interchanges allow passengers to change trains without changing to another platform. This applies at places where trains of different directions meet in minor and major hubs, but this arrangement is only found at some interchange stations in metro and other rail networks worldwide.
===Between different train categories===
Some railway lines, usually in more congested areas, also offer cross-platform interchanges between different categories of trains, for example between express and stopping ("local") trains. For instance, this kind of interchange is used at many European railway minor hubs to connect fast trains to local feeder services, as well as surface sections of suburban lines like the RER E in Paris or the Metro North Hudson Line in New York State. However, local–express interchanges are found in only a few metro networks, such as Chicago, Chengdu, London, New York City, and Philadelphia. The New York City Subway system has numerous stations facilitating cross-platform transfers between local and express trains, typically using pairs of island platforms, each serving express trains on one side, and local trains on the other side, with both alternatives headed in the same direction.<ref name=MTA-HowtoRideSubway></ref><ref name="IRT2007"></ref>
As express and stopping trains usually head for different directions, cross-platform interchange between different train categories (e.g. interchanges between metros and railways) is commonly combined with cross-platform interchanges between different lines.
==Service levels of connections==
In some, but not all, cases, the trains are coordinated in the timetable.
===Noncoordinated===
In the case, the cross-platform infrastructure offers the possibility of easily changing trains, independently from the waiting time for the second train. In metro systems with short headways, waiting time is small, but such an noncoordinated approach could reduce the advantages of stairless cross-platform interchange in railway networks with less dense train traffic.
===Coordinated===
A more advanced approach involves the coordination of the lines' timetables to reduce the scheduled changing time, either from one line to the other, or, ideally, bidirectionally, between both trains at the same time. This concept is widely used in Dutch, German, and Swiss railway networks, where trains of different lines meet at the same platforms in numerous hubs all over the country.
===Optimised, with connection guarantee===
Most advanced are coordinated cross-platform interchanges wherein interconnected trains also wait for each other to 'guarantee' scheduled interchanges, even in the event of modest delays. In order to still ensure on-time running across the network, additional waiting time for trains is usually limited to a certain period of time depending on general network performance, further connections to be guaranteed, train category, train line, and a balanced consideration of other factors.
In practice, most railways coordinating cross-platform interchanges define a certain waiting time window for each 'guaranteed' interchange. Some railway operators will briefly delay train departure signals to allow imminently arriving passengers time to interchange. For example, the Vienna U-Bahn metro signals train drivers to wait briefly, by operating a special white light signal triggered by the approach of an interchange train on another track.
==Example interchanges==
In most cases, only cross-platform interchanges used for both directions of travel are listed, with some exceptions.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
===Asia===
====Beijing====
Guogongzhuang station offers cross-platform interchange between Line 9 and Fangshan line. National Library station offers cross-platform interchange between Lines 4 and 9. In addition Nanluoguxiang station<ref>(Chinese) urltoken "南锣鼓巷地铁站可双向同台换乘" baic.gov.cn 2012-05-17</ref> (Lines 6 and 8), Zhuxinzhuang station (Changping line and Line 8), Beijing West railway station (Lines 7 and 9), Yancun East station (Fangshan Line and Yanfang Line) offer cross-platform interchange.
====Chengdu====
Xipu Station in Chengdu provides cross-platform interchange between Line 2 of Chengdu Metro and Chengdu–Dujiangyan Intercity Railway of the Rail transport in China. It is the first implementation of cross-platform interchanges between different train categories in China.<ref></ref> Metro-only cross-platform interchanges exist between Lines 2, 4 and 5 at Chengdu University of TCM & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital station and outbound direction interchanges between Line 3 and Line 10 at Taipingyuan Station.
====Chongqing====
Line 5 and Line 6 of the Chongqing Rail Transit offer a paired cross-platform interchange for passengers transferring among 4 directions between the two lines at Ranjiaba and Dalongshan stations.
====Dalian====
The Dalian Metro has a cross platform interchange between Line 1 and Line 12 at Hekou Station.
====Guangzhou====
Guangzhou Metro offers three two way cross-platform interchanges by 2016, between Line 2 and Line 3 at Jiahewanggang Station, between Line 8 and the extended Guangfo Line at Shayuan Station and one between both branches of Line 3 at Tiyu Xilu Station. At Tiyu Xilu Station the northern section of Line 3 terminates at the center track serving both island platforms connecting to the southern section of Line 3 stopping at the outer tracks. In 2016, a single direction cross platform interchange started operating between the westbound Line 7 and northbound Line 2 trains at Guangzhou South Railway Station.
====Hangzhou====
Hangzhou Metro's East Railway Station and Pengbu Station offer paired cross-platform interchange between Line 1 and Line 4. Qianjiang Road Station offers a single cross-platform interchange between Line 2 and Line 4. There is a provision for another paired cross-platform interchange at West Lake Cultural Square and Wulin Square Stations between Line 1 and the planned Line 3. Another provision for cross-platform interchange was also made at Coach Center Station between Lines 1 and the planned Line 9. More cross-platform interchanges are under construction including one at University of Eastern Medicine Station between Lines 4 and 6.
====Hong Kong====
In the MTR (MTR) system of Hong Kong, cross-platform interchange stations first appeared at Mong Kok and Prince Edward stations when Tsuen Wan line was opened. The interchange is two stations long, with inverse cross-platform interchange assigned to Prince Edward and same-direction interchange to Mong Kok as large volumes of traffic had been anticipated in both modes.
Popular with passengers, this design was repeated on Admiralty station when the Island line was opened to deal with the heavy opposite-direction interchange anticipated. Years later, another interchange spanning Tiu Keng Leng station (same direction) and Yau Tong station (opposite direction) was built to the same configuration as Mong Kok and Prince Edward.
The Ma On Shan line is specifically designed to follow right-hand traffic rules unlike other railway lines in Hong Kong to enable a single-direction cross-platform interchange at Tai Wai station to the East Rail line while keeping all platforms at roughly the same height.
Another configuration found in Lai King station makes commute in both directions more convenient by aligning both tracks leading towards city next to each other on one level, and both tracks leading away from city next to each other on the other level. The configuration for North Point station is similar to provide convenience for passengers travelling towards city, although the distance between the two platforms are longer compared to other stations.
Before the MTR–KCR merger in 2007, Nam Cheong station was served by MTR's Tung Chung line and KCR's West Rail line. Due to the different fare system, platforms of southbound Tung Chung Line and northbound West Rail were separated by wall even though they were at similar elevations. After the merger, some sections of the wall was demolished in order to provide cross-platform interchange between southbound Tung Chung Line and northbound West Rail line. However, this arrangement does not serve the dominant rush hour passenger flows, which are between New Territories and Hong Kong Island, as well as between Lantau Island and Tsim Sha Tsui.
By connecting East Rail and West Rail lines at Hung Hom without through-running, both lines terminate there alternating on both East/West Rail platforms to offer cross-platform interchanges.
At Sunny Bay station, passengers on the Tung Chung Line from the city can make a cross-platform interchange to a Disneyland Resort line Train. However, the inverse is not the case, as passengers returning to the city from Hong Kong Disneyland need to use an overpass to catch a Hong Kong-bound train.
====Kuala Lumpur====
 offers cross-platform interchange between Sri Petaling Line (Line 4) and Kelana Jaya Line (Line 5) while offers cross-platform interchange between Ampang Line (Line 3) and Sri Petaling Line (Line 4)
====Kyoto====
There is a cross-platform interchange between the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line and the Keihan Keishin Line at .
====Nanjing====
Nanjing Metro's Nanjing South Railway Station offers cross-platform interchange between Lines 1 and 3 and single direction cross platform interchange between Line S1 and Line S3. In addition, a cross platform interchange is available at Xiangyulunan Station between Line S1 and Line S9, and Konggangxinchengjiangning Station between Line S1 and Line S7.<ref name=jschina1></ref>
====Nanning====
A paired cross platform interchange is available between Line 1 and Line 2 at Nanning railway station and Chaoyang Square station.
====Osaka====
The Osaka Metro has a cross-platform interchange between the Midosuji Line and the Yotsubashi Line at Daikokuchō, where the platforms are at the same level.
Kintetsu Railway also has a cross-platform interchange between the Nara Line and the Osaka Line at Tsuruhashi, where the platforms are at the same level.
Hanshin Railway has a same direction cross-platform interchange between the Namba Line and Hanshin Main Line at Amagasaki.
====Qingdao====
Cross-platform interchange is available between Line 2 and Line 3 at Wusi Square Station. A provisions for cross platform interchange between Line 3 and the under construction Line 8 were made at Qingdao North Railway Station.<ref>
The New York City Subway has many three- or Quadruple track with local and express service. Cross-platform interchanges are located in numerous locations throughout the system to allow for convenient transfers between express and local trains. In general, express trains run on the inner pair of tracks and bypass local-only stations, while local trains run on the outer pair of tracks and stop at every station. Express stations typically have island platforms between the express and local tracks, allowing passengers to quickly switch between trains heading in the same direction simply by crossing a platform.<ref></ref>
In addition to the very common express-local interchanges, the New York City Subway also has several cross-platform interchanges between lines that do not share a three- or four-track right-of-way:
* The Queensboro Plaza station contains a same-directional cross-platform transfer between the IRT Flushing Line and BMT Astoria Line . The Flushing Line's connection with the Astoria Line is the line's only connection with the rest of the system.
* The Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets and Jay Street–MetroTech stations in Brooklyn allow cross-platform interchanges between the of the IND Crosstown Line with the of the IND Fulton Street Line, the of the IND Culver Line, respectively. The Fulton Street Line does not have any track connections with the Crosstown Line, and the Fulton Street Line's track connection to the Culver Line is rarely used.
* At the Seventh Avenue&ndash;53rd Street station on the , there are no track connections between the on the IND Queens Boulevard Line and the on the IND Sixth Avenue Line. At Seventh Avenue, there is also a feature unique to the system, as anti-directional cross-platform interchanges can be made here (albeit between trains heading in the same general cardinal direction, due to the track layout near the station).
* The DeKalb Avenue and Prospect Park stations on the BMT Brighton Line in Brooklyn feature cross-platform interchanges to the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and the BMT Franklin Avenue Line , respectively.
* The Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station in Manhattan has a cross-platform interchange between the two 63rd Street Lines .
The Jamaica hub station of the Long Island Rail Road features coordinated cross-platform interchanges among the many services that stop there. During peak periods, this is enhanced by having three trains arrive at the same time, and a cross-platform interchange can be done by walking across through the train on the center track, which is waiting with its doors open on both sides. In the absence of this middle train, interchanging passengers must walk to one end of the long platform, walk to another platform, and then walk back in order to move between trains on the outer two tracks.
==== Philadelphia ====
The SEPTA Broad Street Line has cross-platform interchanges between local and express trains at Olney Transportation Center, Erie, Girard, Spring Garden, Race-Vine, City Hall, and Walnut-Locust.
==== San Francisco Bay Area ====
Three adjacent stations of the BART system, namely Oakland City Center / 12th Street, 19th Street / Oakland and MacArthur stations, feature cross-platform interchange between the Antioch–SFO/Millbrae line and the Richmond-Fremont line. The trains are so timed that the trains bound for Pittsburg/Bay Point and Richmond arrive at the same time at 19th Street Oakland station; the trains might arrive at the same time at the other stations too, but that is not guaranteed. Only MacArthur station has enough platforms to enable such "timed" transfer between trains bound for San Francisco Airport/Millbrae and for Fremont at the extremes of the system.
The forced transfer (between the main BART systems and eBART) for continuing passengers at a transfer platform east of Pittsburg/Bay Point has a cross-platform interchange to traditional service.
An intermodal cross-platform interchange exists at the Millbrae Intermodal Terminal in Millbrae, California, between Caltrain commuter rail service and BART.
==== Vancouver ====
In December 2016, Lougheed Town Centre station on the Vancouver SkyTrain was expanded to a 3-track, 2-platform station in preparation for the beginning of service on the Evergreen Extension. For the first 18 months of service on the Evergreen Extension, the third platform served eastbound trains while the southern half of the island platform served westbound trains (with Millennium Line trains running left-handed through the station); this measure allowed a same-direction cross-platform transfer between Millennium Line trains headed to VCC–Clark and Expo Line trains headed to Waterfront (via Columbia). On June 25, 2018, normal right-hand running of Millennium Line trains through the station resumed, making it possible to do an anti-directional cross-platform transfer between Expo Line trains headed for Production Way–University and Millennium Line trains headed to Lafarge Lake–Douglas.<ref></ref>
===Oceania===
==== Auckland ====
At Newmarket Station, there are three lines serving two island platforms. Western Line services use the centre line (which can serve both platforms) allowing cross-platform interchange with Southern Line services which use the outer lines.
==== Melbourne ====
Railways in Melbourne offers cross-platform interchanges along the City Loop according to the operation concept depending on time and day. All three underground stations consist of four tracks and two island platforms one above each other.
Burnley Group passengers can also change between Flinders Street direct and City Loop services at Richmond station on weekday mornings.
Camberwell station operates as a partial cross-platform interchange off-peak, when Alamein services operate as shuttles from Camberwell. During the day, terminating trains from Alamein drop passengers off (before proceeding to a reversing track west of the station) on platform 2, which connects to a city-bound Belgrave/Lilydale line train on platform 1. At night, trains from Alamein terminate and reverse on platform 1, allowing cross-platform transfers for passengers from the city arriving on platform 2 on a Belgrave/Lilydale service.
==== Sydney ====
The Sydney Trains suburban railway system offers cross-platform interchange at Central between express and local trains to/from Strathfield as well as on the four-track section from Westmead to St Marys along the Western Line, each in the same direction. Selected cross-platform interchanges can also be made at Glenfield, Granville, Hornsby, Lidcombe, Redfern, Revesby and Town Hall.
Cross-platform interchange is also available between Sydney Metro and Sydney Trains services at Chatswood.
===South America===
==== Buenos Aires ====
Plaza Miserere provided cross transfer interchange between subway line A and suburban railroad line Sarmiento. There is a never used cross-platform interchange between lines A and D at Plaza de Mayo station and three abandoned cross-platform interchanges: at Primera Junta station between line A and the former tram service towards Lacarra avenue and at San José station on line E between the branch going to Bolívar station and the closed branch to Constitución station where another cross-platform interchange was provided between lines C and E.
Suburban lines Sarmiento, San Martín and Roca offers many cross-platform interchanges between express and local services on their 4 track stretches.
==== Santiago de Chile ====
Vicuña Mackenna metro station is the only in the metro network of Santiago Metro offering cross-platform transfer; the through-running line 4 and its shuttle line 4A are interconnected cross-platform here. Line 4A uses the center track between both island platforms, with line 4 stopping on the outer tracks.
==== São Paulo ====
Only two stations of São Paulo Metro and train network offer cross-platform interchange: Paraíso, between lines 1 (towards Jabaquara) and 2 (towards Vila Madalena), and Brás, between lines 7 and 11 (both towards Luz).

A cross-platform interchange is a type of interchange between different lines at a metro (or other railway) station. The term originates with the London Underground;<ref></ref> such layouts exist in other networks but are not commonly so named. In the United States, it is often referred to as a "cross-platform transfer".
This configuration occurs at a station with island platforms, with a single platform in between the tracks allocated to two directions of travel, or two side platforms between the tracks, connected by level corridors. The benefit of this design is that passengers do not need to use stairs to another platform level for transfer, thus increasing the convenience of users. A cross-platform interchange arrangement may be costly due to the complexity of rail alignment, especially if the railway designers also arrange the track with flyovers (which is typically done to increase efficiency). A common two-directions cross-platform interchange configuration consists of two directions of two different lines sharing an island platform, and the respective return directions of both lines sharing a different island platform in the same station complex. Much rarer is a cross-platform interchange to transfer onto the same line as in Kirkby and Ormskirk.
