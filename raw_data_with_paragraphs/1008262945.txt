Geography of Ireland

==Natural resources==
===Bogs===
Ireland has 12,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (about 4,600&nbsp;sq miles) of bogland,<ref></ref> consisting of two distinct types: blanket bogs and raised bogs. Blanket bogs are the more widespread of the two types. They are essentially a product of human activity aided by the moist Irish climate. Blanket bogs formed on sites where Neolithic farmers cleared trees for farming. As the land so cleared fell into disuse, the soil began to leach and become more acidic, producing a suitable environment for the growth of Calluna and rushes. The debris from these plants accumulated and a layer of peat formed. One of the largest expanses of Atlantic blanket bog in Ireland is to be found in County Mayo.<ref></ref>
Raised bogs are most common in the Shannon basin. They formed when depressions left behind after the last ice age filled with water to form lakes. Debris from reeds in these lakes formed a layer at the bottom of the water to form fens. Dead plant matter, preserved by the water, eventually filled the lake, covering this alkaline base. This led to the growth of plants that could survive in a wet low-nutrient acidic medium, The plants kept growing and dying, increasingly well preserved by the acidic conditions and they piled up raising the surface of the bog above the surrounding land, forming raised bogs.<ref></ref>
Since the 17th century, peat has been cut for fuel for domestic heating and cooking, and it is called turf when so used. The process accelerated as commercial exploitation of bogs grew. In the 1940s, machines for cutting turf were introduced and larger-scale harvesting became possible. In the Republic, this became the responsibility of a semi-state company called Bord na Móna. In addition to domestic uses, commercially extracted turf is used in a number of industries, producing peat briquettes for domestic fuel and milled peat for electricity generation.<ref></ref> More recently peat is being combined with biomass for dual-firing electricity generation.<ref></ref>
In recent years, the destruction of bogs has raised environmental concerns. The issue is particularly acute for raised bogs which were more widely mined as they yield a higher-grade fuel than blanket bogs. Plans are now in place in both the Republic and Northern Ireland to conserve most of the remaining raised bogs on the island.<ref></ref>
===Marine resources===
Ireland has major marine resources, with a significant fishing industry in the Atlantic Ocean. The Exclusive Economic Zone of the Republic of Ireland is .
===Oil, natural gas and minerals===
Offshore exploration for natural gas began in 1970.<ref name="sch">Shannon, Corcoran & Haughton (2001), The petroleum exploration of Ireland's offshore basins: introduction, Geological Society, London Lyell Collection—Special Publications, p 2</ref> The first major discovery was the Kinsale Head gas field in 1971.<ref></ref> Next were the smaller Ballycotton gas field in 1989,<ref name="sch"/> and the Corrib gas field in 1996.<ref></ref> Exploitation of the Corrib project has yet to get off the ground because the Corrib gas controversy to refine the gas onshore, rather than at sea, has been met with Shell To Sea. Gas from these fields is pumped ashore and used for both domestic and industrial purposes. The Helvick oil field, estimated to contain over of oil, was discovered in 2000.<ref></ref> Ireland is the largest European producer of zinc, with three operating zinc-lead mines at Navan, Galmoy and Lisheen. Other mineral deposits with actual or potential commercial value include gold, silver, gypsum, talc, calcite, dolomite, roofing slate, limestone aggregate, building stone, sand and gravel.<ref></ref>
In May 2007 the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (now replaced by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources) reported that there may be volumes over of petroleum and of natural gas in Irish waters<ref name="oilbonanza"></ref> – worth trillions of Euro, if true. The minimum confirmed amount of oil in the Irish Atlantic waters is , worth over €450 billion. There are also areas of petroleum and natural gas on shore, for example the Lough Allen basin, with of gas and of oil, valued at €74.4 billion. Already some fields are being exploited, such as the Spanish Point field, with of gas and of oil, valued at €19.6 billion. The Corrib Basin is also quite large, worth anything up to €87 billion, while the Dunquin gas field, initially estimated to have of natural gas and of petroleum<ref name="oilbonanza"/> but 2012 revised estimates suggest only of natural gas and barrels of oil condensate.<ref></ref>
In March 2012 the first commercial oil well was drilled 70&nbsp;km off the Cork coast by Providence Resources. The Barryroe oil well is yielding 3500 barrels per day; at current oil prices of $120 a barrel Barryroe oil well is worth in excess of €2.14bn annually.<ref></ref>

From an administrative viewpoint, 21 of the counties in the Republic are units of local government. The other six have more than one local council area, resulting in a total of 31 county-level authorities. County Tipperary had two ridings, North Tipperary and South Tipperary, originally established in 1838, renamed in 2001<ref></ref> and amalgamated in 2014.<ref></ref> The cities of Dublin, Cork and Galway have city councils and are administered separately from the counties bearing those names. The cities of Limerick and Waterford were merged with their respective county councils in 2014 to form new city and county councils. The remaining part of County Dublin is divided into Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Fingal, and South Dublin.<ref name="placenames"/>
Electoral areas in Ireland (the state) are called constituencies in accordance with Irish law, mostly follow county boundaries. Maintaining links to the county system is a mandatory consideration in the re-organisation of constituency boundaries by a Constituency Commission.<ref></ref>
In Northern Ireland, a major re-organisation of local government in 1973 replaced the six traditional counties and two county boroughs (Belfast and Derry) by 26 single-tier districts,<ref name="doe-ni"></ref> which, apart from Fermanagh cross the traditional county boundaries. The six counties and two county-boroughs remain in use for purposes such as Lieutenancy. In November 2005, proposals were announced which would see the number of local authorities reduced to seven.<ref>" urltoken Major reform of local government". bbc.co.ik, 22 November 2005.
