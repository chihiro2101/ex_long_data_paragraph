Empress Meishō

==Genealogy==
Before Meishō's accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne, her personal name (her imina) was ;<ref>Ponsonby-Fane, p. 9.</ref> and her pre-accession title was . She was the second daughter of Emperor Go-Mizunoo. Her mother was Tokugawa Masako, daughter of the second Tokugawa shōgun, Tokugawa Hidetada and his wife Oeyo.<ref>NHK announced that its 2011 Taiga drama would be Gō: Himetachi no Sengoku, based on the life of Oeyo, the mother of Tokugwa Masako.</ref><ref name="j-dorama"> urltoken "Atsuhime" - Autorin für NHKs 2011er Taiga-Drama gewählt , j-dorama.de; accessed 13 July 2015.</ref> Hidetada was the son of Tokugawa Ieyasu and his consort, Oai.<ref>Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 392.</ref>
Meishō lived within the Inner Apartments of the Heian Palace, as opposed to the section reserved for the women of the Imperial Court. She had no children of her own, and was succeeded by her younger paternal half-brother, Go-Kōmyō. Her name was derived by combining the names of two previous empresses, Empress Genmei (707–715) and her daughter Empress Genshō (715–724).
==Events of Meishō's life==
Okiko-naishinnō became empress following the abdication of her father. The succession (senso) was considered to have been received by the new monarch; and shortly thereafter, Empress Meishō is said to have acceded (sokui).<ref>Titsingh, urltoken p. 411; A distinct act of senso is unrecognized prior to Emperor Tenji; and all sovereigns except Jitō, Yōzei, Go-Toba, and Fushimi have senso and sokui in the same year until the reign of Emperor Go-Murakami</ref><ref>Varley, H. Paul (1980). Jinnō Shōtōki p. 44.</ref> The events during her lifetime shed some light on her reign. The years of Meishō's reign correspond with the development and growth of the Tokugawa shogunate under the leadership of Tokugawa Iemitsu.

Empress Meishō reigned for fifteen years. Although there were seven other reigning empresses, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century.<ref name="jt2007"> urltoken "Life in the Cloudy Imperial Fishbowl", JapanTimes.co.uk, March 27, 2007.</ref> Empress Gemmei, who was followed on the throne by her daughter, Empress Gensho, remains the sole exception to this conventional argument.
* December 4, 1696: The former empress died at age 72.<ref name="meyer186"/>
The kami of this empress is venerated in the imperial mausoleum at Tsuki no wa no misasagi, which is located at Sennyū-ji in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto. Also enshrined is her father, Emperor Go-Mizunoo and her immediate Imperial successors – Go-Kōmyō, Go-Sai, Reigen, Higashiyama, Nakamikado, Sakuramachi, Momozono, Go-Sakuramachi and Go-Momozono.<ref>Ponsonby-Fane, p. 423.</ref>
===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.
In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career. During Meishō's reign, this apex of the Daijō-kan included:
* Sesshō, Ichijō Akiyoshi, 1629–1635
* Sesshō, Nijō Yasumichi, 1635–1647
* Sadaijin
* Udaijin
* Naidaijin
* Dainagon
