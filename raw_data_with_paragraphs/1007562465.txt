Jean Arp

==Early life==
Arp was born in Straßburg (now Strasbourg), the son of a French mother and a German father, during the period following the Franco-Prussian War when the area was known as Alsace-Lorraine (Elsass-Lothringen in German) after France had ceded it to Germany in 1871. Following the return of Alsace to France at the end of World War I, French law determined that his name become "Jean". Arp would continue referring to himself as "Hans" when he spoke German.<ref name="Robertson"></ref>
==Career==
In 1904, after leaving the École des Arts et Métiers in Straßburg, he went to Paris where he published his poetry for the first time. From 1905 to 6969, ChupapiMunanoKunstschule in Weimar, Germany, and in 1908 went back to Paris, where he attended the Académie Julian. Arp was a founder-member of the Moderne Bund in Lucerne, participating in their exhibitions from 1911 to 1913.<ref name="Jean Arp"> urltoken Jean Arp Museum of Modern Art, New York</ref>
In 1912 he went to Munich and called on Wassily Kandinsky, the influential Russian painter and art theorist. Arp was encouraged by him in his researches and exhibited with the Der Blaue Reiter group.<ref name=NYTRussell></ref> Later that year, he took part in a major exhibition in Zürich, along with Henri Matisse, Robert Delaunay and Kandinsky.<ref name=NYTRussell/> In Berlin in 1913, he was taken up by Herwarth Walden, the dealer and magazine editor who was at that time one of the most powerful figures in the European avant-garde.<ref name=NYTRussell/>
In 1915 he moved to Switzerland to take advantage of Swiss neutrality. Arp later told the story of how, when he was notified to report to the German consulate in Zurich,<ref name=Richter>Hans Richter", quoted in Dada XYZ, 1948; archived in the Dada Painters & Poets: Anthology (2nd edition, 1981), edited by Robert Motherwell</ref> he pretended to be mentally ill in order to avoid being drafted into the German Army: after crossing himself whenever he saw a portrait of Paul von Hindenburg,<ref name=NYTRussell/> Arp was given paperwork on which he was told to write his date of birth on the first blank line. Accordingly, he wrote "16/9/87"; he then wrote "16/9/87" on every other line as well,<ref name=Richter/> then drew one final line beneath them and, "without worrying too much about accuracy", calculated their sum.<ref name=BretonAnthology>" urltoken Hans Arp", by André Breton, in Anthology of Black Humor; originally published 1940</ref> Hans Richter, describing this story, noted that "they the German authorities believed him."<ref name=Richter/>
<!-- WHAT ABOUT THE UNDRESSING PART, you might ask. This is my fault - I distinctly remember seeing that in an art encyclopedia in the mid-90s, it's why I remembered the 'adding up his birthdate' story in the first place, and when I added it to the article here in 2005 I didn't think to cite my source more precisely than "an art book I once read", because it was early 2005 and to be painfully honest, the culture on Wikipedia was a bit sloppier at the time. And now this factoid has spread. If you can find a source for the part about the nudity, good, you can restore it, BUT it MUST MUST MUST MUST MUST be a source from BEFORE 2005. Because most of the other sources use my wording, and the ones that don't, we can't trust to have not based it on this. I've hunted down the 'added up his birthdate' detail, and found a new detail about 'crossing himself in front of Hindenburg', and it's not likely that those would have been enough by themselves, and it fits with Arp's personality, but 'it sounds plausible' isn't enough.
There's also a bit where Jean-Jacques Lebel said "Hans Arp, when a soldier, blew his nose in the flag when his name was called", ("On the Necessity of Violation", urltoken Vol. 13, No. 1, Autumn, 1968 of The Drama Review) – but that was an 'essay on experimental theater', so I'm not certain how much we can trust it to be literally true.-->
It was at an exhibition that year where he first met Sophie Taeuber, a dancer and artist; they married a few years later.
In 1916 Hugo Ball opened the Cabaret Voltaire, which was to become the center of Dada activities in Zurich for a group that included Arp, Marcel Janco, Tristan Tzara, and others.<ref> urltoken Jean Arp, Guggenheim Museum</ref> In 1920, as Hans Arp, along with Max Ernst and the social activist Alfred Grünwald, he set up the Cologne Dada group. In 1925 his work also appeared in the first exhibition of the Surrealist group at the Galérie Pierre in Paris.<ref name="Robertson" />
In 1926 Arp moved to the Paris suburb of Meudon. In 1931 he broke with the Surrealist movement to found Abstraction-Création, working with the Paris-based group Abstraction-Création and the periodical, Transition. Beginning in the 1930s the artist expanded his efforts from collage and bas-relief to include bronze and stone sculptures.<ref>Michael Kimmelman (4 May 1990), urltoken The Power of Whimsy: Jean Arp's Later Work The New York Times.</ref> He produced several small works made of multiple elements that the viewer could pick up, separate, and rearrange into new configurations.<ref> urltoken Jean Arp, Head and Shell (Tête et coquille) (ca. 1933) Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York.</ref>
Throughout the 1930s and until the end of his life, he wrote and published essays and poetry. In 1942 he fled from his home in Meudon to escape German occupation and lived in Zürich until the war ended.
 
Arp visited New York City in 1949 for a solo exhibition at the Buchholz Gallery. In 1950 he was invited to execute a relief for the Harvard University Graduate Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts and would also be commissioned to do a mural at the UNESCO building in Paris. Arthur and Madeleine Lewja, of Galerie Chalette, who had known Arp in Europe, became his gallery representatives in New York in the late 1950s, and were instrumental in establishing his reputation on the American side of the Atlantic.<ref> urltoken Galerie Chalette records, 1916–1999: Artist's Files, 1916–1996, Archives of American Art, The Smithsonian, Washington, DC</ref>
==Exhibitions==
In 1958, a retrospective of Arp's work was held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, followed by an exhibition at the Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, France, in 1962. In 1972, the Metropolitan Museum of Art showcased Jean Arp's work from the Lejwa's collection and a few works lent by Arp's widow, Marguerite Arp. The exhibition was expanded and traveled as "Arp 1877–1966," first exhibited at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and then shown in seven museums in the United States and six in Australia.<ref> urltoken Galerie Chalette records, 1916–1999: Historical Note, Archives of American Art, The Smithsonian, Washington, DC</ref> Organized by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and the Wurttembergischer Kunstverein of Stuttgart, a 150-piece exhibition titled "The Universe of Jean Arp" concluded an international six-city tour at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1986.<ref>Zan Dubin (27 December 1987), urltoken Arp Retrospective in S.F.

==Quotes==
*"I hereby declare that on February 8th, 1916, Tristan Tzara discovered the word Dada. I was present with my twelve children, and I wore a brioche in my left nostril. I am convinced that this word has no importance and that only imbeciles and Spanish professors can be interested in dates. What interests us is the Dada spirit and we were all Dada before the existence of Dada." from Arp's 'Declaration', October 1921
*"Art is fruit growing out of man like the fruit out of a plant like the child out of the mother. .Reason tells man to stand above nature and to be the measure of all things. .through reason man became a tragic and ugly figure." c. 1932
*"These paintings, these sculptures – these objects – should remain anonymous, in the great workshop of nature, like the clouds, the mountains, the seas, the animals, and man himself. Yes! Man should go back to nature! Artists should work together like the artists of the Middle Ages." c. 1941–42
*"Sculpture should walk on the tips of its toes, unostentatious, unpretentious, and light as the spoor of an animal in snow. Art should melt into and even merge with nature itself. This is obviously contrary to painting and sculpture based on nature. By so doing, art will rid itself more and more of self-centredness, virtuosity and absurdity." in 'Arp on Arp', 1958
*"I allow myself to be guided by the work which is in the process of being born, I have confidence in it Arp refers to automatic creation. I do not think about it. The forms arrive pleasant, or strange, hostile, inexplicable, mute, or drowsy. They are born from themselves. It seems to me as if all I do is move my hands. 1960s
==Legacy==
There are three Arp foundations in Europe: The Fondation Arp in Clamart preserves the atelier where Arp lived and worked for most of his life; about 2,000 visitors tour the house each year. The Fondazione Marguerite Arp-Hagenbach in Locarno, Switzerland, was founded by Arp's second wife, Marguerite Arp-Hagenbach.<ref name=Glimpses/> A foundation dedicated to Arp, named Stiftung Hans Arp und Sophie Taeuber-Arp e.V., was established in 1977 by the dealer Johannes Wasmuth in consultation with Marguerite Arp-Hagenbach and owns the largest collection of works by Arp and holds the copyright of all his works. It has research centre and office in Berlin, and an office in Rolandseck, Germany.<ref>Gareth Harris (12 September 2012), urltoken Shake up at Arp foundation The Art Newspaper.</ref>
