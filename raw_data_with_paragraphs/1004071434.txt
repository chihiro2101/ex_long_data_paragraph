East Riding of Yorkshire

===Renewable energy===
The UK government has set a target to generate 10% of the UK's electricity from renewable energy sources by 2010. The Energy White Paper (2003) sets out the Government's aspiration to double that figure to 20% by 2020. It has additionally signed up to the legally binding Kyoto Protocol, which requires a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5% of 1990 levels by 2008–12 and a reduction of CO2 emissions by 20% of 1990 levels by 2010. Regional and local authorities are required to contribute to the delivery of these national targets. The East Riding has an above-average potential to generate renewable electricity for Local Authorities in the region due its large wind energy potential.<ref>
</ref> The East Riding of Yorkshire is set a target of 41&nbsp;MW by 2010, and a target for 2021 of 148&nbsp;MW for installed grid-connected renewable energy. There are operational wind farms at Lissett in Holderness and Out Newton to the north of the Humber Estuary.<ref>
</ref><ref></ref>
There are single turbines at the Waste Water Treatment Works at Saltend and at Loftsome Bridge Water Treatment Works near Barmby on the Marsh.<ref>
</ref> In addition, several other wind developments have either been given or are applying for permission. By late February 2009 there was existing developed capacity or planning approval for 140&nbsp;MW of renewable energy from wind farm developments. The overall renewable energy target for 2010 and 2021 has therefore already been exceeded by wind energy proposals alone, assuming some of these schemes will be operational by 2010. The East Riding has also exceeded 148&nbsp;MW, when other renewable energy types such as biomass are included in the calculation.<ref>
</ref><ref></ref> The Humber Estuary is to be used for trials of a tidal stream generator. If successful, it will be used to develop larger models which could be deployed in a 100-unit "renewable power station" capable of powering 70,000 homes.<ref>

The East Riding local education authority supports 150 schools: 131 primary schools and 19 secondary schools.<ref>
</ref> The total net spending per head of population on education rose from £578.08 in 2006/07 to £632.88 in 2007/08.<ref name="Facts and figures"/>
In 2009 primary school test results showed a slide down the national performance table for the East Riding authority, dropping eight places in the national league table to 28th after other education authorities improved more in the tests.<ref>
</ref><ref>
</ref>
At secondary level the authority slipped seven places to 39th out of 149 authorities, despite producing the best set of General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) results since the inception of the East Riding of Yorkshire Council in 1996. The percentage of students achieving five or more good GCSEs, at grades A*–C including maths and English, rose to 52.5 per cent, from 50.8 per cent in 2007. This is above the national average of 47.6 per cent.<ref>

Bishop Burton is the location of Bishop Burton College, a further education and higher education college specialising in agriculture and equine studies.<ref>

Beverley Grammar School, which was founded around 700 AD, is widely renowned for being the oldest continuously operating state school in England.
Furthermore, Hull is home to several schools, including the private Hymers College, and a university. The University of Hull was founded as a university college in 1927 and received full university status in 1954; it is home to the Hull York Medical School, and has seen large scale expansion in recent years to cater for the ever-growing number of students.

There are ten household waste recycling sites across the East Riding. In the financial year 2004/05 of municipal waste was collected by East Riding and by Hull. Between 2003/04 and 2004/05 the amount of waste collected in Hull increased by 1.77% and in the East Riding by 4.80% . Target 45+ is a joint sustainable waste-management strategy developed in partnership by Hull City Council and the East Riding of Yorkshire Council. The overall aim is to achieve 45% recycling or composting by 2010 and then go beyond this. At the outset it was anticipated that recycling rates in the East Riding by the end of 2005/06 would be 22.4% and in Hull the rate would be 17.4%.<ref>
</ref>
The Waste Recycling Group is a company working in partnership with the Hull City and East Riding of Yorkshire councils to deal with waste. The company has plans to build an energy from waste plant at Saltend to deal with of rubbish and put waste to a productive use by providing power for the equivalent of 20,000&nbsp;houses.<ref>
</ref>
The East Riding of Yorkshire is notably high for recycling rates. The county was marked first in England for household waste recycling, composting and re-use rate in 2017. Figures highlight that 65.4% of household waste in the county was recycled or composted, ahead of second-place Rochford District who were marked at 63.9%.<ref></ref>

The East Riding is characterised by a high employment rate and a relatively low unemployment level. The overall unemployment rate is 4.3%, which is 1.2 percentage points lower than the national average. However, there are unemployment hotspots in Bridlington, Goole and Withernsea.<ref name="Facts and figures"></ref> Unemployment levels tend to fluctuate over the course of the year with lower levels during the summer months due to increased employment in the tourism and food production sectors. A major year-round employer in the East Riding is the Defence School of Transport at RAF Leconfield, which trains 14,000 personnel from the Army, the Royal Air Force and the Royal Marines each year and provides more than 1,000 civilian jobs.<ref>
