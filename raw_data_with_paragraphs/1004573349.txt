==Career==
Maupin worked at WRAL-TV in Raleigh, a station managed by future U.S. Senator Jesse Helms. Helms nominated Maupin for a patriotic award, which Maupin won. Maupin said he was a typical conservative and segregationist at this time and admired Helms, as a hero figure". Maupin later changed his opinion and condemned Helms at a pride parade on the steps of the North Carolina State Capitol.<ref name=grow/><ref name=ny></ref><ref name=kuow/> Maupin is a veteran of the United States Navy and served several tours of duty including one in the Vietnam War.
Maupin worked at a Charleston newspaper and the San Francisco bureau of the Associated Press in 1971.<ref> – in Guest Informant, 1998–1999. Maupin recalls his first experiences of San Francisco.</ref><ref>He said he had "no sense of it being a gay mecca" and called it "this amazing city that embraced me, that had made me aware of my true self", and "what really floored me was that the straight folks in San Francisco were so civilised about homosexuality." (in the New York Times interview)</ref> In 1974, he began what would become the Tales of the City series as a serial in a Marin County-based newspaper, the Pacific Sun, moving to the San Francisco Chronicle after the Sun San Francisco edition folded.<ref name=time/>
In 1978, Maupin publicly accused San Francisco Police Inspector Dave Toschi of faking one of the Zodiac Killer's taunting letters to the media, seriously and irreparably damaging Toschi's career and reputation. Maupin claimed to have noticed a similarity between anonymous fan mail Toschi had sent him after Maupin based one of his Tales of the City characters on him, and a Zodiac letter received by the San Francisco Chronicle on April 24, 1978. Although the USPS crime lab cleared Toschi of being the Zodiac letter's author, Toschi was removed from the case and his chances of succeeding Charles Gain as chief of the San Francisco PD were destroyed.<ref> urltoken The incident is portrayed in the 2007 David Fincher film Zodiac.
==Works==
===Tales of the City===
Tales of the City is a series of novels, the first portions of which were published initially as a newspaper serial starting on August 8, 1974, in a Marin County newspaper, The Pacific Sun, picked up in 1976 by the San Francisco Chronicle, and later reworked into the series of books published by HarperCollins (then Harper and Row). The first of Maupin's novels, entitled Tales of the City, was published in 1978. Five more followed in the 1980s, ending with the last book, Sure of You, in 1989.<ref name=time></ref> 
A seventh novel published in 2007, Michael Tolliver Lives, continues the story of some of the characters. It was followed by an eighth volume, Mary Ann in Autumn, published in 2010 and a ninth and final volume, The Days of Anna Madrigal, in 2014.<ref></ref> In Babycakes, published in 1983, Maupin was one of the first writers to address the subject of AIDS.<ref name=EW/> Of the autobiographical nature of the characters, he says "I've always been all of the characters in one way or another."<ref name=pub/>
The Tales of the City books have been translated into ten languages, and there are more than six million copies in print. Several of the books have been adapted and broadcast on BBC Radio 4.<ref name="BBC Radio 4"></ref>
====Television miniseries====
The first three books in the series have also been adapted into three television miniseries starring Olympia Dukakis and Laura Linney. The first airing was on PBS; subsequent miniseries appeared on Showtime.<ref> TV Guide, January 1994. Article by Maupin about the difficult process of getting the Tales series into TV production.</ref> Additionally, a miniseries has been made for Netflix that premiered June 7, 2019.
====Musical projects====
He collaborated on Anna Madrigal Remembers, a musical work written by Jake Heggie and performed by choir Chanticleer and mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade on August 6, 1999, for which Maupin provided a new libretto. He also participated in a concert series with the Seattle Men's Chorus entitled Tunes From Tales (Music for Mouse), which included readings from his books and music from the era.<ref></ref>
In May 2011, a theatrical musical version of Tales of the City had its premiere at American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. The musical has a score and lyrics by Jake Shears and John Garden of the rock band Scissor Sisters, and a book by Jeff Whitty. It was directed by Jason Moore.<ref></ref>
===Maybe the Moon and The Night Listener===
Maupin wrote two novels, Maybe The Moon and The Night Listener, which are not part of Tales, though both books occasionally glance in that direction.
Maybe The Moon is a story Maupin describes as "partly autobiographical", despite the main character being a female heterosexual Jewish dwarf. The character was also based on his friend Tamara De Treaux, who played the title character in the 1982 film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.<ref> – San Francisco Focus Magazine], October 1992.

The Night Listener is a roman à clef, inspired by Maupin's experiences concerning the Anthony Godby Johnson hoax.<ref name=out/><ref></ref><ref> urltoken Audio interview about The Night Listener – on WHYY-FM, October 3, 2000</ref><ref> – a story featuring the fictional characters in Noone at Night</ref> He says he wanted to create a psychological thriller, while being able to put autobiographical elements in it.<ref name=ny/> The issues he addresses include the ending of his relationship with his life partner and his relationship with his father. The book very lightly references the Tales world via Gabriel Noone's assistant, who is one of DeDe Halcyon-Day's twins from Tales. It was serialized on the internet, on Salon.com, prior to its print publication.<ref name=ny/> The Night Listener was adapted into a movie that was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in late January 2006 and released by Miramax the following August.<ref name=out/>
===Michael Tolliver Lives===
Prior to the 2007 release of Michael Tolliver Lives, Maupin had been quoted on his website as saying that another Tales of the City novel was unlikely.<ref></ref> Although Maupin originally stated that this novel was "NOT a sequel to Tales of the City and it's certainly not Book 7 in the series,"<ref></ref> he later conceded that "I've stopped denying that this is book seven in Tales of the City, as it clearly is . I suppose I didn't want people to be thrown by the change in the format, as this is a first person novel unlike the third person format of the Tales of the City books and it's about one character who interrelates with other characters. Having said that, it is still very much a continuation of the saga and I think I realised it was very much time for me to come back to this territory."<ref></ref>
The novel is written from the first-person perspective of Tales character Michael 'Mouse' Tolliver, now in his fifties and living as an HIV-positive man.<ref name=ad> urltoken "Armistead Maupin talks!" – Advocate.com</ref> It also features appearances by familiar Tales characters, such as Anna Madrigal.<ref> urltoken "Sex and the city" – Interview in The Observer</ref> Maupin said: "I was interested in pursuing the life of an aging gay man, and Michael was the perfect vehicle . However, as soon as I started writing, I found that, one by one, all the other characters stepped forward and asked to be present. It felt natural, so I went with it."<ref name=EW></ref> He calls it "a smaller, more personal novel than I've written in the past."<ref name=ad/> The book was released on June 12, 2007, which was declared 'Michael Tolliver Day' by the mayor of San Francisco.<ref></ref><ref> urltoken "Reader, he married him" – Review in The Guardian</ref>
Mary Ann in Autumn was published November 12, 2010 by Harper/HarperCollins, continuing the series. It was reviewed by Joseph Salvatore in the New York Times Sunday Book Reviews on November 14.<ref></ref> It was followed in January 2014 by The Days of Anna Madrigal, which Maupin says will be the final novel in the series.<ref></ref>
