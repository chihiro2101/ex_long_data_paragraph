Water slide

==Traditional water slides==
===Body slides===
As the name suggests, body slides feature no mat or tube, and instead, riders sit or lie directly on the surface of the slide. The simplest resembles a wet Playground slide. 
There are a variety of types of body slides including Flume, speed slides, bowls and AquaLoops; the latter three are explained below.
===Inline tube slides===
Some slides are designed to be ridden with a tube which typically seats either 2 or 3 riders inline. Similar to a traditional body slide, these slides include many twists and turns and come in a variety of types including bowls, funnels and half-pipes.
===Longest===
The world's longest water slide was a temporary installation in Waimauku, New Zealand, in February 2013. Constructed with a length of ,<ref></ref> of which functioned properly.<ref name="riding" /> Its creators claimed the previous record holder had a length of ~.<ref name="riding"></ref> The slide is being moved to Action Park in Vernon, New Jersey.<ref></ref>
The "Waterslide" at Buena Vista Lodge in Costa Rica is a long water slide where the rider sits directly on the slide, with an inner-tube around their upper body for safety.<ref> urltoken Waterslide at Buena Vista Lodge, Costa Rica</ref>
The longest multi-person water-coaster (see below) is the long Mammoth at Holiday World in Santa Claus, Indiana.<ref> urltoken Mammoth at Holiday World, Santa Claus, Indiana</ref>

===AquaLoop===
The first known existence of a looping water slide was at Action Park in Vernon Township, New Jersey in the mid-1980s, named Cannonball Loop. This slide featured a vertical loop but was repeatedly closed due to safety concerns.<ref name="Traction Park 21">Austin, op. cit., 21.</ref><ref name="Tom Fergus">Fergus, Tom; May 2006; "Another Action Park Employee Spills His Guts", in "The Reaction to Traction at Action Park"; Weird NJ, 29.</ref><ref name="Steve Braybrook">Braybrook, Steve; May 2006; "A Survivor from Action Park Writes In", in "The Reaction to Traction at Action Park"; Weird NJ, 29.</ref> In the late 2000s, Austrian manufacturer Aquarena developed the world's first safe looping water slide, known as the AquaLoop. The company engineered a slide with an inclined loop rather than a standard vertical one.<ref name="Aquarena AquaLoop"></ref> The slide is currently licensed and distributed by Canadian water slide manufacturer WhiteWater West.<ref name="WhiteWater West AquaLoop"></ref> There are nearly 20 AquaLoop installations around the world.<ref name="LA Times US AquaLoop"></ref> The first installation was in Slovenia in 2008.<ref></ref> The largest collection is located at Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast in Australia which houses 4 AquaLoops that opened in 2010. Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast was also the first to install more than one AquaLoop at a single location.<ref name="WhiteWater West Dueling AquaLoops announcement"></ref><ref name="GCB Fun the theme for school holidays"></ref><ref></ref> The AquaLoop uses a trap-door to release riders down a near-vertical descent at a speed of up to . Riders experience 2.5&nbsp;Gs in less than 2 seconds.<ref></ref> The whole ride is over within 7 seconds.<ref></ref>
===Bowl===
, the riders circle the outer area of the bowl before exiting down through the middle, often into a pool underneath but sometimes into an additional slide section.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> This style of water slide comes in various styles and is manufactured by ProSlide,<ref name="ProSlide Behemoth Bowl"></ref><ref name="ProSlide Cannon Bowl"></ref><ref name="ProSlide Bullet Bowl"></ref><ref name="ProSlide Pro Bowl"></ref> WhiteWater West<ref name="WhiteWater SuperBowl"></ref><ref name="WhiteWater SpaceBowl"></ref> and Waterfun Products.<ref name="Waterfun Body Bowl"></ref> The different variations can be ridden on a 4-person cloverleaf tube,<ref name="ProSlide Behemoth Bowl"/> 2 person inline tube,<ref name="ProSlide Cannon Bowl"/><ref name="WhiteWater SuperBowl"/> single person tube<ref name="ProSlide Bullet Bowl"/> or as a body slide.<ref name="ProSlide Pro Bowl"/><ref name="WhiteWater SpaceBowl"/><ref name="Waterfun Body Bowl"/>
===Family rafting===
Family rafting water slides have the largest capacity of all the different types of tubing water slides averaging between 4 and 6 riders per dispatch. Riders hop in a circular raft and travel down long, twisted channels to the ground.<ref></ref> This type of water slide is manufactured by Australian Waterslides and Leisure,<ref name="Australian Waterslides and Leisure"/> ProSlide,<ref></ref><ref name="ProSlide Dark Mammoth"></ref> Waterfun Products<ref name="Waterfun Products People Eater"></ref> and WhiteWater West.<ref name="WhiteWater Family Rafting"></ref> All of these companies manufacture open-air slides while ProSlide also manufactures an enclosed version.<ref name="ProSlide Dark Mammoth"/>
===Funnel===
 which is installed at almost 60 locations around the world dating back to 2003.<ref></ref> In 2010, WhiteWater West began developing a competing product known as the Abyss, utilizing a raft that holds up to six riders.<ref></ref>
===Half-pipe===
Similar to a funnel, a half-pipe features a slide in which riders oscillate back and forth. However, this style of ride does not feature any enclosed sections. On a Waterfun Product Sidewinder or Sidewinder Mini, riders oscillate several times before coming to a rest at the base of the slide. Riders then need to walk off the slide returning their tube to the next riders.<ref></ref><ref></ref> On a WhiteWater West Boomerango or Family Boomerango, riders are sent down a steep drop and up a steep hill on the other side, before sliding backwards down another path to the end of the slide.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
===Multi-lane racer===
A multi-lane racer is a ride where between 4 and 8 riders dive head-first onto a mat and down a slide with several dips. As an additional component of this ride, both some offer an additional enclosed helix at the top of the ride. ProSlide offer ProRacers,<ref></ref> Octopus Racers<ref></ref> and Kraken Racers,<ref></ref> while WhiteWater West have designed the Mat Racers<ref></ref> and Whizzards.<ref></ref> Australian Waterslides and Leisure have also manufactured a standard multi-lane racer.<ref name="Australian Waterslides and Leisure"></ref>
===Speed slide===
A speed slide is a type of body slide where riders are sent down steep, free-fall plunges to the ground. Almost all water slide manufacturers offer a variation of this type of slide. ProSlide & WhiteWater West both offer a speed slide with a trap door, the same trap door found on the AquaLoop.<ref name="Australian Waterslides and Leisure"/><ref></ref><ref></ref>
===Water coaster===
 in Indiana. It replaced the park's own Wildebeest as the longest water coaster in the world.
=== Drop slide ===
A drop slide is a type of body slide where at the end of the slide, riders fall through a hole into a pool underneath.
==Inflatable water slides==
Inflatable water slides are designed for the home user. They are typically made of a thick strong PVC or vinyl and nylon, and are inflated using an electric or gasoline powered blower. The water slide is attached to a water hose in order to generate the supply of water. There are small-sized inflatable water slides for private house uses or larger inflatable water slides for school, picnic, corporate, or carnival style use. 
There are also swimming pool water slides which users can set up to slide straight into a pool. Most parks avoid this due to safety concerns and will have swimming sections in a separate pool.

A <b>water slide</b> (also referred to as a flume, or water chute) is a type of slide designed for warm-weather or indoor recreational use at water parks. Water slides differ in their riding method and therefore size. Some slides require riders to sit directly on the slide, or on a raft or tube designed to be used with the slide.
A typical water slide uses a pump system to pump water to the top which is then allowed to freely flow down its surface. The water reduces friction so sliders travel down the slide very quickly. Water slides run into a swimming pool (often called a plunge pool) or a long run-out chute. A lifeguard is usually stationed at the top and the bottom of the slide, so that if a rider gets hurt they will be treated immediately.
