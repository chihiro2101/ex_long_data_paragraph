Dowry

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, dowry is called Jahez in Arabic (derived from Islamic jahez-e-fatimi).<ref></ref> At over 2000 dowry-related deaths per year, and annual rates exceeding 2.45 deaths per 100,000 women from dowry-related violence, Pakistan has the highest reported number of dowry death rates per 100,000 women in the world.<ref> urltoken Operational Note: Pakistan Refworld, A United Nations initiative (August 2011), pp.&nbsp;16–21</ref><ref></ref>
According to Ansari,<ref>Ansari, A. S. Bazmee (1978) "Is Dowry Obligatory?", Hamdard Islamicus, 1(2):78–84</ref><ref>Masrat Musavi, Fatima – The Ideal Model for Women of All Times, Imam Reza (2003)</ref> Pakistan's Muslim community considers dowry as an obligatory Islamic practice. Over 95 percent of all marriages in Pakistan involves transfer of a dowry from the bride's family to groom's family.<ref> urltoken Adolescents and Youth in Pakistan Zeba Sathar, Cynthia Lloyd, et al., Population Council, with support from UNICEF; pp. 92–116</ref> A 2014 Gallup survey in Pakistan found that 84% of Pakistanis believe that dowry plays either very important or somewhat important role in marriage, while 69% believed it is not possible for a girl to get married without a dowry.<ref>"Tradition of dowry in Pakistan: 56% Pakistanis believe it is impossible for girls to get married without dowry" urltoken Gilani Research Foundation Polls, 17 Jan. 2017 </ref>
Pakistan has seen a rise in the values of dowries in recent decades, as in other South Asian countries.<ref name="Menski 1998 109"/> However, in Pakistan it is still expected that a bride will bring some kind of dowry with her to a marriage, whether she is Muslim, Hindu, or Christian.<ref name="Walbridge 2003 134"></ref> The Dower (bride price), called mahr, and dowry, called jahaiz, are both customs with long histories in Pakistan.

Control of the dowry belongs to the bride in theory, although in practice control often transfers to the husband and in-laws, and grooms sometimes extort large dowries. In rural Pakistan, dowry values are still relatively low, around 12 percent of a household's annual (non-durable goods) expenses. Also, in rural Pakistan it is standard for the bride to maintain control over her dowry after marriage, rather than control of the dowry being given to the in-laws.<ref></ref> A recent survey in January 2017 by Gallup Pakistan showed that 56 percent of the population expects the girl to bring dowry to marriage.<ref></ref> The pressure among some Pakistanis to provide a large dowry results in some brides' families going into debt, including debt servitude; some brides build up their dowry with their own earnings if they work outside the home.<ref name="Walbridge 2003 134"/> The debt trap created by providing large dowries puts pressure on parents aspiring to arrange a marriage for their daughter(s) into a better social class. It is also cited as a reason for the current trend toward delayed marriages. Arranged marriages among first cousins are common, since they provide a way of keeping dowries within an extended family.<ref></ref>
Pakistan has passed several laws to address the problem of excessive dowry demands: West Pakistan Dowry (Prohibition of Display) Act, 1967; Dowry and Bridal Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976. Women's rights to inheritance separate from the dowry are offered some protection in the Muslim Personal Law of Shariat of 1948 and the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance of 1961.<ref name="Esposito, John L. and Natana J. DeLong-Bas 2001 85"/> In October 2020, Pakistan became the first Muslim country to make it illegal to receive dowry as per the tenets of Islamic sunnah.<ref></ref> According to the bill, the maximum amount to be given to the bride as her dowry may be no more than four tola gold, which may include clothes that belong to the bride, and bedsheets only. Guests arriving at the marriage ceremony will be banned from giving gifts costing more than .<ref></ref><ref></ref>
===Nepal===
The practice of dowry is common in Nepal, and dowry-related violence is increasingly becoming a problem. As a result, the dowry system has been banned in Nepal.<ref></ref> Despite the laws, the violent incidents continue, under a general perception of impunity.<ref></ref> Nepali people of the Madhesi people still freely welcome dowry as a right to the groom's side. Even highly educated people living in the Terai of Nepal accept dowry without any second thoughts. Parents have thus started dreading the birth of daughters in the family, going as far as sex selection in order to abort daughters. Many deaths have also been caused by not giving dowry to the groom's side. Dowry system, however, is not practiced by Non-Hindu people or indigenous people.
In Nepal, the practice of dowry is closely related to social prestige; and dowry violence is especially prevalent in the Terai belt. In 2009, Nepal enacted the Social Customs and Practices Act outlawing dowry; however, there have been no known cases of enforcement.<ref></ref>
===Sri Lanka===
Here, the dowry is known as dewedda. The payment of dowry in Sri Lanka has a strong tradition, and has been connected to family violence.<ref></ref> However its importance is declining, and violence related to it is not as common as in other South Asian countries, though it still exists.<ref></ref>
===Afghanistan===
Dowry is called Jehez in Afghanistan,<ref> urltoken Factors Influencing Decisions to Use Child Labour Afghanistan Research Unit, Kabul (August 2008); pp. 14–16</ref> and is separate from Mahr, sherbaha, and brideprice (locally called walwar, toyana, or qalyn).<ref> urltoken Dowry burden unleashes myriad social problems Afghanistan Times, August 3, 2013</ref><ref name="undp.org.af"> urltoken Gender Awareness and Development Manual United Nations Development Program & Government of Afghanistan, Kabul (May 2007); pp. 175–176</ref>
A large dowry is sometimes expected, and given, in Afghanistan; some houses are almost emptied so that the daughter may make a grand show at the wedding. Items included in a dowry depend on the resources of the bride's family and the demands made by the groom's family. Embroidery is traditionally included in a dowry, as is land, money, jewelry such as necklaces and pazab, shoes, shawls, carpets, bedding, furniture, crockery, mirrors, clocks and such items. The dowry is transferred from bride's family house to the groom's family house one day before the wedding day in a ritual ceremony with band and a procession, which typically adopts the longest route in the residential area for the Afghan community to see the dowry being given by the bride's family.<ref>SHAH, Ikbal Ali. The folk life in Afghanistan. Folklore, 30 (1919)</ref><ref></ref>
Afghanistan has both dowry and bride price, although the practice differs between different tribal and ethnic groups. In Afghanistan, a marriage typically requires two kinds of payments: a mahr, which typically consists of livestock, property and money, and in practice often takes the form of a bride price paid to the woman's family; and a dowry brought by the bride to her husband's home which may include various goods such as clothing, bedding and household utensils.<ref name="undp.org.af"/><ref name="Family">Peter Blood (2004), urltoken Family , Afghanistan A Country Study, Library of Congress, </ref> The nature of dowry the bride brings often influences how she is treated when she arrives at her husband's home.<ref name="Family"/> Parents frequently arrange marriages for daughters at a young age, in order to end their economic responsibility for their daughter.<ref name="Stange, Mary Zeiss, and Carol K.

===Turkey===
Dowry is known as çeyiz in Turkey. Ceyiz is the property and/or money the bride's family gives the couple at marriage.<ref>Sherife Ayla Samli (2011), Containing the Future: Modern Identities as Material Negotiation in the Urban Turkish Ceyiz, PhD thesis, Rice University, Houston (US)</ref><ref>Suad Joseph, Afsāna Naǧmābādī, Encyclopedia of Women & Islamic Cultures, Volume 3, , Brill (The Netherlands), p. 263, Quote: "Ceyiz, a combination of dowry/trouseau sic?, takes the form of goods, property, gold or cash given to the bride"</ref> Ceyiz is different and separate from the Mahr, which is paid by the groom to the bride, or traditional baslik in some parts of Turkey. The giving of dowry has been replaced with the exchanging of gifts at the marriage ceremony by family members in modern times.
Ceyiz often includes furnishings, appliances, clothing, gold jewelry, cash and other items depending on the resources of the Turkish family.<ref>Suad Joseph, Afsāna Naǧmābādī, Encyclopedia of Women & Islamic Cultures, Volume 3, , Brill (The Netherlands), pp. 262–263</ref> Some of the Turkish dowry remains with the couple after marriage, other is specifically meant for the groom's family and relatives.<ref>Sandikci and Ilhan (2011), Dowry: A Cherished Possession or an Old-Fashioned Tradition in a Modernizing Society?, in Cele Otnes, Tina M.

Whereas chest and appliance dowries are for the use of the bride and groom, gift dowry are given to relatives. It is required for the bride's family to give gift dowry to the groom's family and relatives. Typically, the parents and siblings receive more valuable items, whereas the relatives are given smaller gifts. By offering valuable gifts to the closest relatives, the bride's family symbolically reaffirms the relatively higher status for the groom's family."</ref> The ceyiz is typically agreed upon between the groom's and bride's families before the wedding date is finalized. According to tradition, even in current times, the dowry is displayed for showing-off, before the marriage in rural Turkey, at the bride's family, or groom's family—the display is typically attended and examined by women, particularly from the groom's family. In some cases, if the groom's family is not satisfied with the displayed dowry, the wedding is cancelled.<ref>Sandikci and Ilhan (2011), in Cele Otnes, Tina M.

===Azerbaijan===
Dowry is known as cehiz in Azerbaijan. Cehiz is the property and money the bride's family must give to the groom's family prior to marriage. Cehiz is separate from the money under Mahr required under Sharia religious requirements in Islamic Azerbaijan. Cehiz often includes furnishings, appliances, crystal, mirrors, bed, jewelry and cash depending on the negotiations between the groom's and bride's families before the wedding day. While the groom's family receives Cehiz, the bride receives Mahr. Relatives of the bride often contribute to the Cehiz demands, through the ritual of koncas. Dowry is transferred a few days before the wedding, and examined by groom's family, and a Sihaye (receipt) for the dowry is issued by the groom's family; this helps avoid disputes. If some items of the dowry are not satisfactory, the wedding may be delayed or cancelled. Similar traditions continue in many regions of Caucasus, including non-Muslim ethnic groups.<ref>Lale Yalçın-Heckman (2005), The Return of Private Property: Rural Life After Agrarian Reform in the Republic of Azerbaijan, , pp. 143–149</ref><ref>Ghaffarzadeh, S.

===Tajikistan===
Dowries are sometimes expected in Tajikistan, and they often consist of a collection of traditional dresses which are on display on the wedding day.<ref></ref>
===Egypt===
In Egypt, dowry is known as Gehaz.<ref name=amin2004></ref><ref> urltoken Marriage in Subsaharan & West African Countries Prezi (2013)</ref> This is the property a bride is expected to bring with her at marriage, and it is different from the dower (Mahr) paid by the groom to the bride per requirements of Sharia. Gehaz is observed in rural and urban Egypt, and is typically negotiated between the groom's family and bride's. Gehaz includes furniture, appliances, jewelry, china, bedding and various household items. Families begin collecting dowry years before a girl is betrothed. Many Egyptian girls take up jobs so as to save money necessary to meet the expected dowry demands.<ref> urltoken Building assets for safe, productive lives – Girls Population Council, New York (2005); pp. 17–19</ref><ref> urltoken Egyptian working women's perceptions of marriage, Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics, Egypt (2005)</ref>
While the dowry is given during the marriage, in rural Egypt, it is ritually displayed to the village prior to the marriage. Every piece of the gehaz is placed on open cars that go around the village several times, with music, in order to show off the dowry being given by the bride's family to the groom.<ref name=amin2004/><ref> urltoken A Collective Model of Female Labor Supply : Do Distribution Factors Matter in the Egyptian Case?

===Morocco===
Dowry is a traditional and current practice in Morocco, and is called shura, shawar, ssdaq or amerwas depending on the speaker's region and ethnicity (e.g. Arabic, Berber, etc.). Dowry in Morocco is separate from the Mahr or Sadaq that is religiously required by Sharia.<ref name=Ziba2000/>
Centuries ago, Mahr and Sadaq meant something different in Morocco. Mahr was the purchase price paid for the bride by the groom's family to the bride's father or guardian, while Sadaq was the betrothal gift offered by groom to the bride.<ref>Edward Westermarck (1914), Marriage ceremonies in Morocco, ISBN MacMillan (London), pp. 65–74</ref> Over time, the difference vanished and they are now one and the same, but different from the practice of dowry.<ref>Maher, V. (1974). Divorce and Property in the Middle Atlas of Morocco. Man, 9(1), pp. 103–122.</ref>
In modern times, the Moroccan practice is to split the so-called Sadaq, which meets the Islamic requirement of Mahr, into two parts: naqd (cash) and kali (remainder Mahr). The Naqd Sadaq is paid by the groom's family to bride's family before the wedding. The bride's family supplements the Naqd amount with an equal or greater amount of cash, and gives dowry (called shura, shawar or amerwas). This dowry typically includes furniture, clothing, appliances, beds, household items, divans, jewelry, and other property. The dowry amounts are negotiated before the wedding. Higher dowry and lower Mahr are expected for widows and divorcées than for virgins. If elders of the two families do not agree on the dowry amount, the marriage is typically delayed or cancelled. The value and composition of the dowry varies according to social class, family wealth and regional customs. The kali al-sadaq (sometimes called mwahhar in Northern Morocco) is paid later, to technically meet the requirements of Mahr under Islamic Sharia. The shura (dowry) far exceeds the kali al-sadaq, and there is a large transfer of wealth from bride's family to the couple and the groom's family.<ref name=Ziba2000>Ziba Mir-Hosseini (2000), Marriage on Trial: A Study of Islamic Family Law, Tauris (London), , pp. 97–102, 70–75</ref><ref>Camillia Fawzi El-Solh and Judy Mabro (1995), Muslim Women's Choices: Religious Belief and Social Reality, , pp. 56–72</ref>
===Bosnia===
Dowry is known as oprema in Bosnia.<ref name=bringa95>Tone Bringa (1995), Being Muslim the Bosnian Way, , Princeton University Press; pp. 137–143</ref><ref>David Rheubottom(1980) in John Comaroff (Editor), Dowry and Wedding Celebrations in Yugoslav, Academic Press (London); pp. 221–251</ref> In neighboring regions, it is sometimes called prikija or ženinstvo. Another term miraz is used sometimes, but miraz is also used to mean inheritance, something different from dowry.<ref>Nusret Mulasmajic, Bosnian-English Dictionary – Turcisms Collorquialisms Islamic Words, </ref><ref>Stanimirovic, V. (2010). Re-Emergence of the Dowry amongst Serbs. Annals Fac. L. Belgrade Belgrade L. Rev., 185.</ref>
Oprema refers to the property the bride's parents give her as part of the marriage. It often includes furniture, kitchenware, decorative items, gold jewelry and other items. Oprema is also different from pohod (gift giving, dar) ritual of Bosnia, as well as the ruho (embroidered clothing) ritual. Oprema is discussed between the groom's and bride's family before the marriage; the groom's family sets the quality and quantity expectations. The oprema is typically not displayed to those who attend the wedding. Oprema and dar are a major economic burden to bride's family in Bosnia. Poorer families spend years saving money and buying oprema in order to get their daughter(s) married.<ref name=bringa95/><ref></ref><ref></ref>
===Serbia===
In Serbia, in some rural areas, the custom of dowry continues to be observed.
Dowry has been brought to medieval Serbia mainly through Byzantine influences; it was not originally a Slavic custom. The Turkish conquest of Serbia has caused the temporary disappearance of dowry, but the custom re-emerged in the 19th century. The communist regime sought to abolish dowry, but the custom has survived in some rural areas to this day.<ref></ref>
==Violence against women and international perspectives==
Disputes related to dowry sometimes result in violence against women, including killings and acid attacks. Amnesty International has stated:<ref></ref>
The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women classifies violence against women into three categories: that occurring in the family (DV), that occurring within the general community, and that perpetrated or condoned by the State. Family violence is defined as follows:<ref></ref>
Kirti Singh states, "Dowry is widely considered to be both a cause and a consequence of son preference. The practice of dowry inevitably leads to discrimination in different areas against daughters and makes them vulnerable to various forms of violence."<ref></ref> Singh suggests this may lead to girls being unwanted, sex selective abortion, or her parents may abandon or mistreat her after she is born. UNICEF notes dowry helps perpetuate child marriage.<ref></ref> The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concern for dowry-related femicide, citing the study by Virendra Kumar which argued that dowry deaths occur primarily in areas of the Indian subcontinent. They note the estimates for actual number of dowry deaths per year vary widely ranging from 600–750 homicides a year to 25,000 homicides a year, with official government records suggesting 7,618 deaths in 2006.<ref name=":0" /><ref></ref> Rakhshinda Perveen states thousands of dowry-related bride burning cases in Pakistan, yet few prosecutions and rare convictions for dowry-related violence against women.<ref name=rperveen></ref>
UNODC includes dowry deaths as a form of gender-based violence.<ref></ref> About 4.6% of total crimes against women in India were dowry death-related, and another 1.9% were related to violation of Dowry Prohibition Act.<ref></ref> The dowry death rate in India has been about 0.7 women per 100,000 every year from 1998 to 2009.<ref> p. 61</ref>

A dowry is a transfer of parental property, gifts, property or money upon the marriage of a daughter (bride).<ref name=jgoody1976/> Dowry contrasts with the related concepts of bride price and dower. While bride price or bride service is a payment by the groom, or his family, to the bride, or her family, dowry is the wealth transferred from the bride, or her family, to the groom, or his family. Similarly, dower is the property settled on the bride herself, by the groom at the time of marriage, and which remains under her ownership and control.<ref></ref>
Dowry is an ancient custom, and its existence may well predate records of it. Dowries continue to be expected and demanded as a condition to accept a marriage proposal in some parts of the world, mainly in parts of Asia, Northern Africa and the Balkans. In some parts of the world, disputes related to dowry sometimes result in acts of violence against women, including killings and acid attacks.<ref></ref><ref name=":0"></ref><ref></ref> The custom of dowry is most common in cultures that are strongly patrilineal and that expect women to reside with or near their husband's family (patrilocality).<ref name="dowry marriage custom"></ref><ref> urltoken Women’s Safety: Ghosts on the Prowl Mahfuzur Rahman, Dhaka Courier, January 26, 2012</ref><ref></ref>
Bangladesh has seen a rise in the expected size of dowries in recent decades, as its middle class has grown. Sociologist Sarah White has argued that the dowry is not compensation for weakness in women's economic contribution. Instead, its main function is now to support family advancement by mobilizing additional resources. It also demonstrates an ongoing commitment to the norms of masculine provision and protection. Dowries make women more valuable, which pushes against the background of widespread corruption and political and gender violence.<ref></ref>
A negative factor is a rise in the rate of "dowry deaths". In Bangladesh, dowry killings are more frequently done by stabbing or poison rather than burning. Dowry extortion is also a problem in Bangladesh.<ref name="Menski 1998 109"></ref> From January to October 2009, more than 3,413 complaints were made to the police in Bangladesh concerning beatings and other abuses related to dowries.<ref></ref> One of the methods used by families who are unhappy with dowry includes acid throwing, in which concentrated acid is thrown on the bride's face to cause disfiguration and social isolation. From 1995 to 1998, 15 women reported dowry disputes as the motivation behind acid attacks, though that number may be low due to underreporting.<ref>International Women's Rights Action Watch Asia Pacific. Baseline Report: Violence Against Women in Bangladesh. 1–78.</ref> Bangladesh is combating the problem with legislation largely copied from that of India. Laws prohibiting dowry in Bangladesh include Dowry Prohibition Act, 1980; Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Ordinance, 1982; and Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Ordinance, 1986.
Dowry Prohibition Act Clause 4 states that anyone demanding dowry from a person has committed a crime. The law does not have any clause stating punishment to misuse it. Therefore, the law is frequently used by women to harass in-laws and husbands.<ref name="News article on Dowry Law Abuse"></ref>
