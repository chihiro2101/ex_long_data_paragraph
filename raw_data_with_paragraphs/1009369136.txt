Cities of the Philippines

==Government==
A city's local government is headed by a mayor elected by popular vote. The vice mayor serves as the presiding officer of the Sangguniang Panlungsod (city council), which serves as the city's legislative body. Upon receiving their charters, cities also receive a full complement of executive departments to better serve their constituents. Some departments are established on a case-by-case basis, depending on the needs of the city.

===Defunct/dissolved cities===
* Legazpi City (1948–1954): Legazpi's cityhood was approved on June 18, 1948. Under Republic Act No. 306, Legazpi became a city after the President of the Philippines proclaimed its cityhood.<ref name="ChanRobles-RA306"></ref> Comprising the present-day territories of Legazpi City and Daraga, the city was dissolved on June 8, 1954<ref name="AngelfireCom-Legazpi"></ref> when Legazpi and Daraga were made into separate municipalities. Legazpi eventually became a city on its own on June 12, 1959.
* Basilan City (1948–1973): Formerly part of the city of Zamboanga until it was made a city on its own in 1948 through Republic Act No. 288.<ref name="ChanRobles-RA288"></ref> Delimited to only the downtown area of what is now Isabela City upon the creation of the province of Basilan in 1973 through Presidential Decree No. 356 by President Ferdinand Marcos.<ref name="ChanRobles-PD356"></ref> Finally abolished and its territory annexed to the Isabela, Basilan on November 7, 1975 through Presidential Decree No. 840.<ref name="ChanRobles-PD840"></ref>
* Rajah Buayan City (1966): Under Republic Act No. 4413,<ref name="LawPhilNet-RA4413"></ref> the then-municipality of General Santos in what was then the unified province of Cotabato was to be formally converted into a city named after a historical ruler in Mindanao on January 1, 1966, provided that majority of qualified voters in the municipality vote in favor of cityhood in a plebiscite. In December 1965 the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) proclaimed the cityhood of Rajah Buayan, with 4,422 people voting for and 3,066 voting against. However, two residents of the new city challenged this by arguing in the courts that the number of people who voted in favor of cityhood did not form a majority in light of the fact that there were 15,727 voters in the city. The court issued an injunction on January 4, 1966 restraining city officers from performing any acts authorized by or pursuant to provisions in RA 4413. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld this decision on October 29, 1966 and declared that the city charter was not accepted by majority of voters, thus rendering RA 4413 null and void.<ref name="LawPhilNet-GRL-25469"></ref> The municipality of General Santos would later be converted into a General Santos in 1968.
===="League of 16" and legal battles====
The Supreme Court of the Philippines, by a highly divided vote of 6–5, on November 18, 2008, subsequently upheld with finality on May 6, 2009, declared unconstitutional cityhood laws converting 16 municipalities into cities. The 24-page judgment of Justice Antonio T. Carpio, adjudged that the following Cityhood Laws violate secs. 6 and 10, Article X of the Constitution of the Philippines:
*RA # 9389 (Baybay in Leyte)
*RA # 9390 (Bogo in Cebu)
*RA # 9391 (Catbalogan in Samar)
*RA # 9392 (Tandag in Surigao del Sur)
*RA # 9393 (Lamitan in Basilan)
*RA # 9394 (Borongan in Eastern Samar)
*RA # 9398 (Tayabas in Quezon)
*RA # 9404 (Tabuk in Kalinga)
*RA # 9405 (Bayugan in Agusan del Sur)
*RA # 9407 (Batac in Ilocos Norte)
*RA # 9408 (Mati in Davao Oriental)
*RA # 9409 (Guihulngan in Negros Oriental)
*RA # 9434 (Cabadbaran in Agusan del Norte)
*RA # 9435 (El Salvador in Misamis Oriental)
*RA # 9436 (Carcar in Cebu)
*RA # 9491 (Naga in Cebu)
:The Court held that the foregoing Cityhood Laws, all enacted after RA 9009s effectivity, "explicitly exempt respondent municipalities from the increased income requirement from 20 million to 100 million in Sec. 450 of the Local Government Code (LGC), as amended by RA 9009. Such exemption clearly violates Section 10, Article X of the Constitution and is thus patently unconstitutional. To be valid, such exemption must be written in the Local Government Code and not in any other law, including the Cityhood Laws."<ref name="gr176951"></ref><ref name="SCJudiciaryGovPH-16Cities"></ref>
However, more than a year later, on December 22, 2009, acting on the appeal of the so-called League of 16 Cities (an informal group consisting of the sixteen local government units whose cityhood status had been reversed), the Supreme Court reversed its earlier ruling as it ruled that "at the end of the day, the passage of the amendatory law (regarding the criteria for cityhood as set by Congress) is no different from the enactment of a law, i.e., the cityhood laws specifically exempting a particular political subdivision from the criteria earlier mentioned. Congress, in enacting the exempting law/s, effectively decreased the already codified indicators."<ref name="DailyTribune-SCReversesItself"></ref> As such, the cityhood status of the said 16 LGUs was effectively restored.
On August 24, 2010, in a 16-page resolution, the Supreme Court reinstated its November 18, 2008, decision striking down the cityhood laws, reducing once more the sixteen LGUs to the status of regular municipalities.<ref name="SCJudiciaryGovPH-SCReinstates"></ref>
The most recent development in the legal battles surrounding the League of 16 came on February 15, 2011. Voting 7–6, the Supreme Court (SC) ruled that 16 towns that became cities in 2007 can stay as cities. This was the fourth time the SC has ruled on the case, and the third reversal. It said the conversion of the 16 towns into cities met all legal requirements.<ref name="GMANews-16Towns"></ref>
===Rejected cityhood===
* Batangas (1965): A majority of the votes cast in the then-municipality of Batangas rejected cityhood in a plebiscite conducted on the same day as the 1965 Philippine general elections, as mandated by Republic Act No. 4586.<ref name="ChanRobles-RA4586"></ref> The city would have been named Laurel City in honor of Jose P. Laurel, the president of the Japanese-sponsored Second Republic. The municipality of Batangas would later be converted into a Batangas City in 1969.
* Tarlac (1969): The city charter of Tarlac (Republic Act No. 5907) was approved on June 21, 1969.<ref name="ChanRobles-RA5907"></ref> Cityhood was rejected in a plebiscite held on November 11, 1969 by a majority of the ballots cast. Tarlac became a city 29 years after, in 1998.
* Ilagan (1999): Republic Act No. 8474, which converted Ilagan to a component city of Isabela, was approved on February 2, 1998.<ref name="ChanRobles-RA8474"></ref> However, majority of votes cast in the plebiscite held on March 14, 1999 rejected cityhood. Ilagan finally became a city after majority of votes cast in the August 11, 2012 plebiscite approved.<ref name="SenateGovPH-RA10169"></ref>
* Novaliches (1999): On February 23, 1998 the controversial City Charter of Novaliches (Republic Act No. 8535) was approved, which sought to create a new city out of the 15 northern barangays of Quezon City.<ref name="ChanRobles-RA8535"></ref> Historically a separate town, Novaliches was distributed between Quezon City and northern Caloocan in 1948. In a plebiscite held on October 23, 1999, the majority of ballots cast (which included all voters of Quezon City and not just the 15 barangays) rejected the cityhood of Novaliches.
* Meycauayan (2001): Cityhood was rejected by majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite held on March 30, 2001 to ratify Republic Act No. 9021.<ref name="LawPhilNet-RA9021"></ref> Meycauayan became a city five years later with the enactment of Republic Act No. 9356<ref name="LawPhilNet-RA9356"></ref> and its ratification through a plebiscite on December 10, 2006.<ref name="NewsFlashOrg-Bulacan"></ref>

A city is one of the units of local government in the Philippines. All Philippine cities are chartered cities , whose existence as corporate and administrative entities is governed by their own specific municipal charters in addition to the Local Government Code of 1991, which specifies their administrative structure and powers. As of September 7, 2019, there are 146 cities.
A city is entitled to at least one representative in the House of Representatives if its population reaches 250,000. Cities are allowed to use a common seal. As corporate entities, cities have the power to take, purchase, receive, hold, lease, convey, and dispose of real and personal property for its general interests, condemn private property for public use (eminent domain), contract and be contracted with, sue and exercise all the powers conferred to it by Congress. Only an Republic Act can create or amend a city charter, and with this city charter Congress confers on a city certain powers that regular municipalities or even other cities may not have.
Despite the differences in the powers accorded to each city, all cities regardless of status are given a bigger share of the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) compared to regular municipalities, as well as being generally more autonomous than regular municipalities.
