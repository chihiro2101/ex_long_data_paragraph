==Synopsis==
===Setting===
The series is set in a fictional 2009, introducing a computer virus called Pluto's Kiss as the cause of a massive Internet shutdown.<ref name = "timeline"></ref> The results are described as catastrophic:<ref name = "buster"/> traffic lights shut down, planes collide in midair, and the American nuclear missiles are nearly launched. As a consequence, cyberspace is subjected to severe restrictions. The virus affects all operating systems except for one, Altimit OS, the only operating system immune to all computer viruses.<ref name = "buster"></ref>
Two years later free access to the networks recovers, bringing with it the release of The World: the first online game since Pluto's Kiss, developed for Altimit OS.<ref name = "timeline"/> The World is portrayed as a fantasy setting wherein player characters can be different classes, adventure by themselves to go searching through dungeons or join with others and form parties, fight monsters and level up, collect new items and participate in special events.<ref name="plot"></ref> At the center of each server is a Root Town, which contain shops, a save point, and the Chaos Gate that players use to travel between servers in the game.<ref name = "bust"/>
Harald Hoerwick is introduced as the creator of The World. He secretly designed the game as a virtual womb in order to create the ultimate artificial intelligence (AI), by receiving emotional and psychological data from the players. His motivation is revealed to be the death of Emma Wielant, a German poet with whom he was in love; the AI, who was named Aura, would serve as the "daughter" they never had.<ref name = "liminality">.hack//Liminality, episode 4, Trismegistus. This episode was released along with the .hack//Quarantine game.</ref> Harald left the gathering of the required data for Aura's development at the care of the core system of The World itself, an omnipresent AI called Morganna Mode Gone.<ref name = "buster"/> The storyline of .hack//Sign, set in early 2010,<ref name = "timeline"/> revolves around the premise of Morganna attempting to stall the growth of Aura indefinitely, after realizing that she will lose her purpose once Aura is complete.
===Plot===
The series follows the story about Tsukasa being mind-trapped into the game. Despite being a "fantasy quest type adventure", it does not rely on action sequences.<ref name = "plot"/><ref name = "active"></ref> Instead, the show is driven by mystery, slowly revealing its secrets to the viewer while paying much attention to the individual characters.<ref name="boredom"></ref> Questions like what happened to Tsukasa in the real world, who he really is, and why he cannot log out are driving points of the story.<ref name = "active"/>
Soon after the beginning of the series, Tsukasa is led to a hidden area. There he meets Morganna, depicted as a voice without physical appearance, and Aura, who appears as a young girl clad entirely in white, floating asleep above a bed. The storyline introduces Morganna as an ally, but her real intentions are unknown at this point.
As the story progresses many characters are introduced, some who want to help, some who have ulterior motives. Then more questions arise as to "what is happening in the game itself, who are these various characters, what are their true goals and what will happen to Tsukasa".<ref name = "active"/> All the while he is seen struggling with his increasingly dire situation as well as his own social and emotional shortcomings. Tsukasa isolates himself, but eventually he begins to get closer to other players, and builds strong relationships with some of them; the most important is the one born between him and Subaru, a kind and thoughtful female Heavy Axeman.<ref name = "active"/><ref name = "mariko">Bear: "The reason Tsukasa is still barely able to be involved with people is because of Subaru. If I was the enemy, I would strike at her." BT: "If that happens, then Tsukasa would surely be unable to recover. (.) We should not think of those two separately." .hack//Sign, episode 24, Net Slum.</ref>
In the meantime, the series follows the quest for the , a legendary item rumored to have the ability to bypass the system in The World.<ref name = "verdict"></ref> Some characters want the Key to gain the power this supposedly confers. Others believe the item will provide Tsukasa with a way to log out. Despite their reasons for seeking it, everyone agrees that it is related to Tsukasa in some way, as he is also a factor bypassing the system in the game. His body being in a coma in the real world adds a sense of urgency to the quest.
Near the end of the series, Tsukasa's real-life identity takes a more central place in the storyline, particularly in relation to his growing bond with Subaru. The series shows his fear and insecurity as he confesses to her that he is probably a girl in the real world.<ref name = "love">Tsukasa: "Is there really a place for me to return to?" Subaru: "There is. As long as you desire it." Tsukasa: "I don't like this place. But. (.) I thought that I was a guy. But that's because my memories were altered. (.) I think the real me is a girl. Do you still want to see me in the real world?" Subaru: "Yes. Because." Tsukasa: "Because?" Subaru: "Because I've been touched by your trembling soul." .hack//Sign, episode 24, Net Slum</ref> It is also at this point when Tsukasa is told Morganna's plan by a highly skilled hacker called Helba. Morganna conceived the plan to link Aura to a character who could corrupt her with negative emotional data, placing her in a state where she would never awaken. The chosen character was Tsukasa, as his mind was filled with distressful memories of his real life. Helba also suggests that when Aura is able to awaken, "the Key of the Twilight will take form".<ref name = "aura-key">Bear: "When Tsukasa is able to log out, then Aura will awaken." Helba: "I believe so. And at that moment, the Key of the Twilight will take form." .hack//Sign, episode 24, Net Slum.</ref>
The story reaches the climax, when Tsukasa confronts Morganna. He declares that he is no longer afraid of her or of reality, and will log out because there is someone he wants to see.<ref name = "morgy-papa">Morganna: "If you obey, I do not need to exercise my power. Do not make me use my power. You know how truly powerful I am!" Tsukasa: "I'm no longer afraid of you or my father! There is someone that I want to see close-up of Subaru's face. So I'm going to return, return to the place where I belong!" .hack//Sign, episode 26, Return.</ref> This statement triggers Aura's awakening, allowing Tsukasa to log out. The last scenes feature an emotional encounter between Tsukasa's real-life self, finally shown to be a girl, and the real-life player behind Subaru.
===Characters===
The primary characters in the series are Tsukasa, BT, Bear, Mimiru and Subaru.
Tsukasa is the protagonist of the story and plays a Wavemaster. At the start of the series he is seen waking up to find himself trapped in The World, unable to log out. He is initially depicted as a cynical introvert who tends to avoid others as much as possible, but his character development shows him growing to realize there are people who care about him.<ref name="plot2"></ref> One of these people is Subaru, a female Heavy Axeman introduced as the leader of the Crimson Knights, a player organization designed to fight injustice (such as player killing) in The World. Most of the time Subaru is the only character preventing the Crimson Knights from running wild; she knows that they must be restrained from abusing their power. She eventually joins in the search of a way to help Tsukasa, and builds a close relationship with him.<ref name = "mariko"/>
Also close to Tsukasa is Mimiru, a Heavy Blade who is poor at planning things out and following through on them. She is the first player to meet Tsukasa, and later forms a bond with him and vows to protect him. She usually hangs out with Bear, trying to solve the mystery of Tsukasa's inability to log out. Bear is an older player of the game and plays a Blademaster. He appears as cool and collected, always willing to help out newbies. He also conducts research in the real world on Tsukasa. One of Bear's acquaintances is BT, a plotting and scheming Wavemaster.
BT teams up with Crim and Sora to find the Key of the Twilight. Crim is a powerful Long Arm, friend of Subaru who founded the Crimson Knights organization with her, but afterwards left it as he found it did not match his personality. Amiable, easygoing and sociable; he prefers to keep the real world and the game separate. Crim's stated goal when playing is simply to have fun,<ref name = "fun">Crim: "I have enough obligations and duties in the real world. I come here to play." .hack//Sign, episode 19, Recollection.</ref> although he never turns down a chance to help somebody in need. Sora is a Twin Blade player killer who enjoys hunting players down, especially attractive female ones, and demanding their Member Addresses in exchange for their lives. He sees Tsukasa as the strongest link to the Key of the Twilight, and starts working with BT in the quest for it.
==Concept and design==
The project development began in early 2000 as a joint effort between Bandai and CyberConnect2, with the original idea of producing an online game.<ref name="uchiyama"/> In online games people can interact with each other and create their own stories. The producers wanted to design a game that would offer the players the same experience, but they later thought it would be more appealing with its own storyline, like in standard offline role-playing video game.<ref name="uchiyama"/> According to Daisuke Uchiyama, sub-leader of Bandai's video game planning department, the result was a challenge to the RPG genre itself:<ref name="uchiyama2"/> an offline RPG, entitled .hack, set in a simulated MMORPG named The World.<ref name="uchiyama"/>
For The Worlds design, writer Kazunori Ito did an extensive research on online games available at the time:<ref name="uchiyama"/> the staff played titles such as Phantasy Star Online, Final Fantasy XI, and Ultima Online.<ref name="mostwanted"> Internet Archive copy.</ref> Nevertheless, according to Hiroshi Matsuyama (president of CyberConnect2), they were not actively looking to make the fictional game seem like a real-life one.<ref name="uchiyama"></ref> Instead, the idea was to create a "gigantic game system that, if the CC Corporation (the creators of The World in the game) actually existed, it would make sense for them to be behind" emphasis added;<ref name="uchiyama"/> a game described by Matsuyama as largely "futuristic and alien".<ref name="uchiyama"/>
As the project started shortly before the PlayStation 2's release, the authors seized the opportunity to make the .hack game on the new platform.<ref name="uchiyama2"></ref> This decision allowed them to develop into unexpected directions.<ref name="uchiyama2"/> Shin Unozawa, general manager of Bandai's game department, suggested dividing the game into four parts and release them in three-month intervals.<ref name="Wong 2005"/> The idea being to follow the Yonkoma style as well as to keep sales constant throughout the year.<ref name="Wong 2005"></ref><ref name="hiroshi"></ref> Taking advantage of the PlayStation 2's capability to read DVD-Video, the authors also decided making an OVA series (.hack//Liminality) comprised by four episodes, one to go with each game.<ref name="uchiyama2"/><ref name="Wong 2005"/> Nevertheless, they still felt the need to bolster the project with something more, therefore they decided to produce .hack//Sign, a TV show timed to air with the first game's release.<ref name="Wong 2005"/> For Kōichi Mashimo it was a hectic schedule: he was directing both animated projects, and was also in the midst of developing the Noir anime series.<ref name="Wong 2005"/>
===Imagery===
The virtual environment depicted in .hack//Sign draws on medieval imagery:<ref name="chanpon-1"></ref> settings range from a Venice-like city to a Gothic stone church, passing by settlements such as villages and castles; the series' scenery shows examples of Celtic art.<ref name = "bust"/> Natural landscapes such as forests and tundras complete the setting design, which overall displays the fantasy theme seen in most MMORPGs.<ref name = "plot"/>
Sadamoto's character designs follow the fantasy theme as well,<ref name = "vision-hack2"></ref> drawing influence from the sword and sorcery subgenre in particular.<ref name="pop-hack"></ref> Character designs also draw on Celts imagery: Director Mashimo acknowledged similarities between Bear's design and Mel Gibson in his role as William Wallace,<ref name="expo-koichi"></ref> an example of Celtic warrior.<ref name="sunday1"></ref> All the characters are given distinctive patterns resembling tattoos, the visual representation of a fictional gameplay aspect called Wave.<ref name = "bust"></ref>
In contrast with The Worlds scenery, real-world sequences are minimalism in their presentation.<ref name="chanpon-1"/> They display faces frequently obscured by shadows or hidden by extreme angles. The dialogue is not heard, but shown through title cards: when someone speaks the screen blacks out and a line of red or blue text appears with the dialogue.<ref name = "otaku-hack"/> The combination of visual and acoustic noise makes reality appear as "some kind of less authentic, alternate channel".<ref name = "otaku-hack"/><ref name="chanpon-1"/>
===Music===
Yuki Kajiura provides a soundtrack permeated by the Celtic style and gaming theme of the series.<ref name = "strain"></ref> The songs feature synthesizer and strings compositions,<ref name = "strain"/> as well as vocals consisting of English chanting.<ref name = "dong"></ref> Celtic influence is prominent in themes such as "Key of the Twilight" and "Open Your Heart".<ref name = "dream-hack"/><ref name="fiction"></ref> Performed by Emily Bindiger, "Key of the Twilight" blends a pulsing drum and bass mix with guitar intonations.<ref name = "strain"/> "Open Your Heart", on the other hand, combines Bindiger's contralto vocals with an uilleann pipes solo.<ref name = "fiction"/> The .hack//Sign soundtrack also features vocals by Yuriko Kaida. "Mimiru" has her humming across a saxophone melody performed by Kazuo Takeda;<ref name = "dream2-hack"/> in "Das Wandern" she sings over a lone piano.<ref name="dream2-hack"></ref>
European influence is prominent in instrumental pieces as well, "Foreigners" being a prime example.<ref name = "strain"/> Reminiscent of a classic Irish diddy, the track comprises a flute dancing across a tribal-like percussion set.<ref name = "dream-hack"/> Orchestral music includes pieces such as "Fear" and "Kiss". "Fear" features an electronic melody wrapped around a digital-beat groove,<ref name = "strain"/><ref name = "dream-hack"/> mixed with a distant voice uttering "feeaarr!".<ref name = "dream-hack"/> Combining "the childlike humanity into a frightening digital reality", the song is an "analogy to the series' plot".<ref name = "strain"/> "Kiss" is a theme that entirely features traditional symphony, although only using a few performers.<ref name = "dream-hack"/> It is a violin and piano mix, used to set mood in the series.<ref name = "strain"/>
The opening theme of the series is "Obsession". Performed by Kajiura's musical group See-Saw, the track features an electric guitar and rapid electronic beat.<ref name="dream-hack"></ref> The closing theme is , also performed by See-Saw.<ref name = "strain"/> It is a blend of Japanese vocals, an Irish bouzouki, acoustic guitars and percussion.<ref name = "dream-hack"/> Both themes were released as a single on May 22, 2002 by Victor Entertainment.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Three original soundtracks with vocals Emily Bindiger, with music and arrangement (and lyrics in vocals themes) by Yuki Kajiura were released. The first original soundtrack was released in North America with the limited edition of the first .hack//Sign DVD.<ref name = "collector1"></ref><ref></ref> This album is a mix of vocal themes and BGM. Most of the vocal songs and a couple of BGM tracks have strong Celtic influence. The BGM is completed with tracks with noticeable console-RPG style.<ref></ref> The second original soundtrack was released in North America with the limited edition of the second .hack//Sign DVD.<ref name = "collector2"></ref><ref></ref> All of the tracks are fairly slow, with catchy beats. The final music soundtrack was titled ".hack//Extra Soundtrack".<ref></ref> In North America this soundtrack was included with the limited edition of the fourth .hack//Sign DVD.<ref name = "collector4"></ref> DSTV-channel/full>

===Themes===
Despite its visual concept, .hack//Sign is not a sword and sorcery story, but an exposition-driven character study.<ref name = "jump"/> It proposes "a trip inside the psychology and soul of an emotionally bruised, but slowly healing person."<ref name = "proto-hack1"/> Themes range from psychological to sociological and are dealt with using classical dialogue as well as image-only introspection.<ref name = "proto-hack1"/><ref name = "proto-hack2"/><ref name = "active"/>
Among the most prominent themes in .hack//Sign are anxiety, its causes, and the effects it has upon human behavior.<ref name = "proto-hack1"/> Scenes of the real world show people living an apprehensive, even painful reality:<ref name="chanpon-1"/> characters' background includes subjects such as dysfunctional families and physical impediments. Tsukasa himself is psychologically affected by years of Child abuse and neglect,<ref name = "proto-hack2"/> a state that gets worse throughout his experience in the game, where his reality disappears and he begins to doubt his own existence.<ref name = "proto-hack1"/> When anxiety is excessive (like in the case depicted by Tsukasa's story) and can not be relieved by practical problem-solving methods, "the human ego uses maneuvers such as a defence mechanism to deny, falsify or even distort reality."<ref name = "proto-hack1"/> The anime series explores this process as the root of emotional and behavioral issues such as detachment and Solitude.<ref name = "proto-hack2"/><ref name = "active"/>
Escapism, if only as representing a consequence of anxiety, is a significant theme in .hack//Sign.<ref name = "proto-hack1"/> The series explores how technology, such as the Internet and online games, can be used to escape reality.<ref name = "active"/> The World is portrayed as a means that people use "to escape their lives", assuming roles online that compensate for their shortcomings in the real world:<ref name="chanpon-1"/> to some, it is a place where they can overcome their physical limitations; to others, it is a social outlet or a world free of rules. In addition, the preference given to the virtual world over reality represents the intrusion of technology in the social structure:<ref name="chanpon-1"/> as people engage in "the wide potential of cyberspace", they become more withdrawn in the real world.<ref name="chanpon-1"/>
Interpersonal relationships are a prominent theme too.<ref name = "proto-hack2"></ref> The show explores the psychological effects social connections have upon people with emotional needs.<ref name = "active"/> Initially Tsukasa shows no respect for any values or other people, but as he engages in relationships, he begins to gradually change, learning to care about others and acquiring the strength to face the reality of his life.<ref name = "proto-hack1"/>

==Reception==
The series has generally been positive. Holly Ellinwood of Anime Active saluted Ito's "well thought out, even provocative" storyline in the 2006 review of the series, saying that it is "far more cerebral, even existential than the anime's other less sophisticated contemporaries."<ref name = "active"/> Nevertheless, reviewers agree that it is the series which viewers either love or hate.<ref name = "jump"/><ref name = "plot"/><ref name = "coffee"/> According to Mike Toole from Anime Jump, it "deserves to be both maligned and admired".<ref name = "jump"/> NeedCoffee's reviewer regarded the show as "one of the most controversial titles in recent years".<ref name = "coffee"></ref> Negative criticism focuses on the slow-paced story and the almost total absence of action sequences, elements which are also considered as what makes the series "most unique".<ref name = "boredom"/><ref name = "sci-fi"></ref> 
Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network called the series "interesting to watch," saying the story gets more "detailed and complex" by the show's fourth episode, praised the music selection, the voice casting, and the artwork.<ref></ref> Dong also said that while the storyline has "aspects of mediocrity, " the storyline is intriguing and intense, and that the series is something that "has to be watched at least once." 
Nick Creamer of Anime News Network called the series the "grandfather of MMO anime," saying it is mellow, contemplative, and slow.<ref></ref> He further said that the show puts you in the middle of relationships between the character and although these are not originally described, views come to understand the logic behind their actions, and added that the "underlying art" of the series holds up. He also said that the series has consistent backgrounds, a diverse music score, and calls the anime, ultimately, a story of "anxiety and identity and virtual selves."
The series received high marks for technical aspects. Chris Beveridge from Anime On DVD feels the animation is "gorgeous" and the "colors are lush and vivid".<ref name = "plot"/> Tasha Robinson from SCI FI Weekly says that "The World<nowiki>'</nowiki>s hugely varied settings provide ever-changing backgrounds,"<ref name = "sci-fi"/> which are considered by Rob Lineberger of DVD Verdict as "detailed and innovative".<ref name = "verdict"/> In his review of the first English release, Mike Toole described the series as "a beautiful, rich-looking series, with frequently sumptuous character design and animation that's only emphasized by the quality of the DVD."<ref name = "jump"/> A negative opinion is expressed by Rob Lineberger himself, who says that "many of the animated sequences were static characters with slightly moving lips."<ref name = "verdict"/> Tasha Robinson, instead, shows a more neutral perspective on this subject, saying that "the animation is simple but attractive."<ref name = "sci-fi"/> A concern several reviewers express is that the gaming environment the series tries to simulate should be more crowded, being a game supposedly extremely popular worldwide.<ref name = "jump"/><ref name = "sci-fi"/> A different opinion is that of Anime Academy's reviewer, who writes that the anime's depiction of the game-world setting is realistic and accurate.<ref name = "a-academy"></ref>
Bandai's release earned praise for the quality of the video transfer and the DVD extras (particularly in the limited edition).<ref name = "jump"/><ref name = "plot"/><ref name = "vision-hack1"></ref> Reviewers appreciated the English voice acting: Lauren Synger from DVD Vision Japan feels that "everyone was very appropriate to their characters", noting that Brianne Sidal did an excellent work capturing Saiga's Tsukasa.<ref name = "vision-Japan"></ref> Lineberger, in contrast, finds the English dub to be "antiseptic and uninspired".<ref name = "verdict"/> Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network thinks for her part that Mimiru sounded bland and poorly executed, but overall, the actors did a good job "delivering their lines and giving life to their characters."<ref name = "dong"/>
Ridwan Khan of Animefringe welcomes the "excellent" .hack//Sign score composed by Yuki Kajiura,<ref name = "strain"/> which is hailed by Mark McPherson from Anime Boredom as "the best orchestrated track ever made for a television series".<ref name = "boredom"/> Most reviewers agree that the soundtrack is one of the series<nowiki>'</nowiki> most prominent features.<ref name = "jump"/><ref name = "verdict"/><ref name = "a-academy"/> A negative criticism on the music is that it tends to overwhelm the dialogue in the first couple of episodes.<ref name = "jump"/><ref name = "plot"/> Kōichi Mashimo has stated that he specifically had the music louder than the dialogue as he tried to do some experimentation, and it was his intent to draw complaints from the audience.<ref name="expo-koichi"/> Still, Chris Beveridge thinks it is an "interesting device to sort of ratchet up the speed of things."<ref name = "plot"/>
