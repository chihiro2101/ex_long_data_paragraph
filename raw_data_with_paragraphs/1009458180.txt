These include the annual Bridgewater Garden Party, urltoken Christmas on the LaHave, the urltoken Growing Green Sustainability Festival, and the urltoken Afterglow Art Festival. Founded in 1891, urltoken The South Shore Exhibition is the town's largest event, attracting some 50,000 people each July. Known locally as "The Big Ex," the week-long agricultural fair hosts the International Ox Pull, bringing together teams from the Maritimes and the Northeastern United States.<ref name="ox"></ref> The Exhibition also features a midway, carnival games, food, alcohol, animal exhibits, and musical acts.
Community music has been a fixture in the town for many years, including the Bridgewater Fire Department Band, active since 1868.<ref></ref> The South Shore Chorale, a seventy-voice mixed chorus, was founded in the 1960s, and for many years, the now-defunct Hospital Chorus and Drama Society helped to raise funds for the Dawson Memorial Hospital (later South Shore Regional Hospital) through its production of Broadway-style musicals.
 urltoken Art Happening was established in 2014 to create a thriving community art space in Bridgewater.

Today, Art Happening is a not-for-profit organization that strives on fun classes, stress relief, and creativity in all shapes and forms.
Like much of Lunenburg County, many of Bridgewater's residents trace their lineage to the Foreign Protestants who arrived in Nova Scotia 18th century. While much of that original culture has been lost, a few remnants remain. Lunenburg pudding, a type of pork sausage, is widely available, and some residents still speak in Lunenburg English, an accent featuring one of the few non-rhotic speech patterns remaining in Canada.
==Sports, parks, and recreation==
Residents of Bridgewater enjoy a relatively extensive parks system, which the town estimates at . This, however, does not include open green space within the town, the inclusion of which would give a much higher total.
The crown jewel of the parks system continues to be the Woodland Gardens, locally known at the "Duck Pond." This park includes the DesBrisay Museum, one of the town's public swimming pools, a large pond and various trails. Shipyards Landing is a large public park located at the reclaimed site of the former Acadia Gas Engine Company. Situated on south King Street along the LaHave River, the area features berthing for boaters and kayakers, picnic and open space, and is often used as a gathering point for festivals, such as Canada Day on the LaHave.
Other parks include Pinecrest and Glen Allen playgrounds, Riverview Park, King Street Court and Pijinuiskaq Park, located in the heart of the downtown. 8 kilometers of the Centennial Trail run through the town, constructed on abandoned rail lines.<ref></ref>
Older recreational facilities include the Bridgewater Memorial Arena (opened in 1949 and closed in 2015), the Curling Club, the Kinsmen Field and the Bridgewater Tennis Club, and multiple softball, baseball, and soccer fields. 
After a long period of stagnation, the 21st century has seen recreation facilities undergo a prolonged expansion.
In 2008, construction began on the HB Studios Sports Centre, a $1.7 million indoor turf, track, and amenities facility located on Glen Allan Drive.<ref></ref>
In 2013, Bridgewater and Municipality of Lunenburg teamed up to construct the multi-purpose urltoken Lunenburg County Lifestyle Centre (LCLC) on North Park Street. This facility includes the Clearwater Seafoods Arena with a 1,200-person seating capacity, the Bank of Montreal Aquatic Centre, and the Margaret Hennigar Public Library. Around the same time, the Bridgewater Marina opened near the former Port of Bridgewater location on the east side of the LaHave River.
In July 2017, the town opened the South Shore Vet Dog Zone (an off-leash dog park) at Generations Active Park near HB Studios Sports Centre.
In the summer of 2018, after years of planning and design work, the Bridgewater Skate Park opened on York Street in Bridgewater, backed by funding contributions from the Town of Bridgewater, Municipality of the District of Lunenburg, and the Province of Nova Scotia.
==Government==
=== Policing ===
The urltoken Bridgewater Police Service has moved towards a community based policing model, working closely with Neighborhood watch programs and local schools, as well as adding foot and bicycle patrols in areas that squad cars are unable to reach.<ref></ref>
The Bridgewater Police Service is governed by the Bridgewater Police Commission. This is made up of both political and citizen appointees. The current chair of the Board of Police Commissioners is Citizen Representative and former mayor, H. David Walker.
=== Planning ===
In 2013, Bridgewater Town Council released the Downtown and Waterfront Master Plan (DWMP) to guide the development of Downtown Bridgewater over the next few decades.<ref></ref> In 2019, the Town of Bridgewater's Planning Department absorbed the Parks, Recreation, and Culture arm of the town's operations and was rebranded as the Department of Community Development.
== Education and health ==
The town is primarily served by urltoken Bridgewater Elementary and urltoken Junior High School, both located on York Street. Located at the northern edge of town, urltoken Park View Education Centre serves grades 10-12 and takes part in the International Baccalaureate program. Along with serving Bridgewater, it also acts as a collector school for students from the rural areas of the county. Centre Scolaire de la Rive-Sud in Cookville offers a primarily French-language education to Francophone families in the area as part of Conseil_scolaire_acadien_provincial . The Lunenburg campus of the Nova Scotia Community College is located on High Street, sharing space with the YMCA. 
The town has two provincial museums, The DesBrisay and the Wile Carding Mill, as well as a urltoken central library.
According to the 2016 census, of the town's population ages 25â€“64, 15.0% had not received a high school diploma while 61.7% had received at least some sort of post secondary degree or certificate. Both figures were slightly worse than the average for Nova Scotia (12.2% and 64.2%, respectively), but significantly better than Lunenburg County (16% and 60.3%) and neighbouring Queens County (20.2% and 51.8%).<ref></ref>
Bridgewater is served by the urltoken South Shore Regional Hospital, located on Glen Allen Drive. Inaugurated in 1988, the facility replaced the 1960s-era Dawson Memorial Hospital located on the south western side of the town. The SSRH serves as the major hospital in the county and offers most standard services.
== Media ==
Bridgewater is served by CKBW-FM radio, CJHK-FM, the urltoken South Shore Breaker, and urltoken LighthouseNOW. Established in 1947, CKBW-FM has shifted its music focus several times over the past two decades, and now airs mostly contemporary pop music. CJHK-FM began operating in 2010 as a sister-station to CKBW, and airs country music. The South Shore Breaker is owned by SaltWire Network and produces a weekly newspaper. The weekly LighthouseNow Progress Bulletin (formerly Bridgewater Bulletin) has been in publication since 1888 and has won numerous awards for its content and lay-out.<ref></ref> LighthouseNOW also distributes the Lighthouse Log, a free weekend paper.
==Transportation==
Since 2008, Bridgewater has supported Active Transportation, which guides policy and infrastructure. The goal is to promote human-powered means of transport as a safe part of everyday life.<ref></ref>
Provincial Highway 103 links Bridgewater with Halifax and Yarmouth via two exits, with another under construction. Trunk highways 10 and 3 meet at Bridgewater, and other provincial routes include 325 and 331.
As the town continues to grow, traffic flow and congestion is of great concern. As Lunenburg County's biggest center of employment and commerce, Bridgewater also sees a large influx of daytime traffic. The town's geography and two bridge crossings within town limits can amplify traffic disruption when construction work forces the closure of one of the main routes.
A public transit pilot operation began in 2017, and was made permanent in 2019 due to use exceeding expectations.<ref> urltoken Bridgewater Transit Is Here to Stay, CKBW Radio, February 26, 2019. Accessed March 6, 2019.</ref>.The town's bus route runs through residential areas and popular destinations once per hour, six days per week. Feasibility studies into public transit between Bridgewater, Lunenburg and Mahone Bay have occurred but have not yet resulted in service.<ref></ref>
There is no freight or passenger rail service.
Historically, the LaHave River was a primary transportation route, although today it is mainly used for recreational boating. The LaHave cable ferry is the only crossing downriver from Bridgewater.
