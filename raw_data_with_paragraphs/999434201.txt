John Sergeant (journalist)

==Early life==
The son of a missionary and linguist, Sergeant is of Russian origin on his mother's side.<ref>Autobiography Give me ten seconds by John Sergeant: Macmillan 2001. On page 19: "Horatio Cook, John's maternal grandfather was a loyal Englishman but also deeply Russian . he could pass without difficulty as a Russian and in Odessa he married the daughter of a priest . my mother would later boast that because of the orthodox tradition . she could lay claim to ancestors going back a thousand years to the beginning of Christianity in Russia."</ref> Sergeant's early life meant that he followed his father's work, and was brought up in locations including Jerusalem and Oxford. Sergeant was educated at Great Tew Primary School, briefly at the independent Bloxham School near Banbury, in Oxfordshire, and then at the independent Millfield School in Street, Somerset.
Sergeant graduated from Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics.<ref name=Personally></ref> Whilst at university Sergeant performed in student comedy revues. After graduation he starred with Alan Bennett in a series of sketch shows on the BBC entitled On the Margin and wrote comedy scripts. He then trained as a journalist at Darlington College while reporting for the Liverpool Echo.
Whilst in Washington during his "gap year" he was present in the crowd to witness Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech in 1963.
==Career==
Sergeant started his journalism career as a correspondent for the Liverpool Echo where he worked for around three years before joining the BBC as a radio reporter in 1970. He was tasked to join the international desk, covering stories in over 25 countries. He then worked as a war reporter in Vietnam and Israel and reported the death of the first British soldier during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. He later covered the opening sessions of the European Parliament and became a Political Correspondent in 1981. He then worked on a documentary called "The Europe We Joined" and has presented BBC Radio 4 programmes Today and The World at One. Having progressed through newspaper, radio and television journalism, he became the BBC's Chief Political Correspondent from 1992 until 2000.
In 2000, Sergeant joined ITN as Political Editor, replacing the retiring Michael Brunson. Sergeant retired himself in 2002 and was replaced at ITN by Nick Robinson.
===Highlights===
In 1987, in Moscow following Margaret Thatcher, he made a comment implying that she had already started campaigning for the General Election in June 1987, despite not having officially declared the contest. "I am serving my country", Thatcher replied.
One of his most memorable moments was when he waited outside the British embassy in Paris for Thatcher, in the hope of hearing her reaction to the first ballot in the party leadership contest of 1990, only to be pushed aside by her press secretary, Sir Bernard Ingham, when Thatcher emerged from the building. For this broadcast, Sergeant won the British Press Guild award for the most memorable broadcast of the year, beating Paul Gascoigne who had been nominated for bursting into tears during the 1990 FIFA World Cup Semi-final against West Germany.
Another political scoop was gained when he was granted the only interview with the then Welsh Secretary, Ron Davies, after he had been forced to resign following his "moment of madness" on Clapham Common in October 1998.
===Strictly Come Dancing===
Sergeant competed with partner Kristina Rihanoff in the sixth series of Strictly Come Dancing which began on 20 September 2008. Although he repeatedly finished bottom of the score board after the judges' votes, the public consistently voted to keep him in the competition, prompting criticism of the viewers' voting by the judges and some dancers.<ref> urltoken John Sergeant dances through divide, BBC News, 17 November 2008</ref> He left the show in Week 10 following a farewell dance saying: "The trouble is that there is now a real danger that I might win the competition. Even for me that would be a joke too far."<ref></ref>
