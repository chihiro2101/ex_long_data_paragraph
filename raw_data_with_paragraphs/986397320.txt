Quantum indeterminacy

==Measurement==
An adequate account of quantum indeterminacy requires a theory of measurement. Many theories have been proposed since the beginning of quantum mechanics and quantum measurement continues to be an active research area in both theoretical and experimental physics.<ref>V. Braginski and F. Khalili, Quantum Measurements, Cambridge University Press, 1992.</ref> Possibly the first systematic attempt at a mathematical theory was developed by John von Neumann. The kind of measurements he investigated are now called projective measurements. That theory was based in turn on the theory of projection-valued measures for self-adjoint operators which had been recently developed (by von Neumann and independently by Marshall Stone) and the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics (attributed by von Neumann to Paul Dirac).
In this formulation, the state of a physical system corresponds to a vector of length 1 in a Hilbert space H over the complex numbers. An observable is represented by a self-adjoint (i.e. Hermitian) operator A on H. If H is finite dimensional, by the spectral theorem, A has an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. If the system is in state ψ, then immediately after measurement the system will occupy a state which is an eigenvector e of A and the observed value λ will be the corresponding eigenvalue of the equation A e = λ e. It is immediate from this that measurement in general will be non-deterministic. Quantum mechanics, moreover, gives a recipe for computing a probability distribution Pr on the possible outcomes given the initial system state is ψ. The probability is
:<math> \operatorname_A(U) S). </math>
This is a probability measure defined on the Borel subsets of R which is the probability distribution obtained by measuring A in S.
==Logical independence and quantum randomness==
Quantum indeterminacy is often understood as information (or lack of it) whose existence we infer, occurring in individual quantum systems, prior to measurement. Quantum randomness is the statistical manifestation of that indeterminacy, witnessable in results of experiments repeated many times. However, the relationship between quantum indeterminacy and randomness is subtle and can be considered differently.<ref>Gregg Jaeger, "Quantum randomness and unpredictability"

In classical physics, experiments of chance, such as coin-tossing and dice-throwing, are deterministic, in the sense that, perfect knowledge of the initial conditions would render outcomes perfectly predictable. The ‘randomness’ stems from ignorance of physical information in the initial toss or throw. In diametrical contrast, in the case of quantum physics, the theorems of Kochen and Specker,<ref>S Kochen and E P Specker, The problem of hidden variables in quantum mechanics, Journal of Mathematics and Mechanics 17 (1967), 59–87.</ref> the inequalities of John Bell,<ref>John Bell, On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox, Physics 1 (1964), 195–200.</ref> and experimental evidence of Alain Aspect,<ref>Alain Aspect, Jean Dalibard, and Gérard Roger, Experimental test of Bell’s inequalities using time-varying analyzers, Physical Revue Letters 49 (1982), no. 25, 1804–1807.</ref><ref>Alain Aspect, Philippe Grangier, and Gérard Roger, Experimental realization of Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen–Bohm gedankenexperiment: A new violation of Bell’s inequalities, Physical Review Letters 49 (1982), no. 2, 91–94.</ref> all indicate that quantum randomness does not stem from any such physical information.
In 2008, Tomasz Paterek et al. provided an explanation in mathematical information. They proved that quantum randomness is, exclusively, the output of measurement experiments whose input settings introduce logical independence into quantum systems.<ref>Tomasz Paterek, Johannes Kofler, Robert Prevedel, Peter Klimek, Markus Aspelmeyer, Anton Zeilinger, and Caslav Brukner, "Logical independence and quantum randomness", New Journal of Physics 12 (2010), no. 013019, 1367–2630.</ref><ref>Tomasz Paterek, Johannes Kofler, Robert Prevedel, Peter Klimek, Markus Aspelmeyer, Anton Zeilinger, and Caslav Brukner, "Logical independence and quantum randomness — with experimental data", urltoken (2010).</ref>
Logical independence is a well-known phenomenon in Mathematical logic. It refers to the null logical connectivity that exists between mathematical propositions (in the same language) that neither prove nor disprove one another.<ref>Edward Russell Stabler, An introduction to mathematical thought, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company Inc., Reading Massachusetts USA, 1948.</ref>
In the work of Paterek et al., the researchers demonstrate a link connecting quantum randomness and logical independence in a formal system of Boolean propositions. In experiments measuring photon polarisation, Paterek et al. demonstrate statistics correlating predictable outcomes with logically dependent mathematical propositions, and random outcomes with propositions that are logically independent.<ref>Tomasz Paterek, Johannes Kofler, Robert Prevedel, Peter Klimek, Markus Aspelmeyer, Anton Zeilinger, and Caslav Brukner, "Logical independence and quantum randomness", New Journal of Physics 12 (2010), no. 013019, 1367–2630.</ref><ref>Tomasz Paterek, Johannes Kofler, Robert Prevedel, Peter Klimek, Markus Aspelmeyer, Anton Zeilinger, and Caslav Brukner, "Logical independence and quantum randomness — with experimental data", urltoken (2010).</ref>
In 2020, Steve Faulkner reported on work following up on the findings of Tomasz Paterek et al; showing what logical independence in the Paterek Boolean propositions means, in the domain of Matrix Mechanics proper. He showed how indeterminacy's indefiniteness arises in evolved density operators representing mixed states, where measurement processes encounter irreversible 'lost history' and ingression of ambiguity.<ref>Steve Faulkner, The Underlying Machinery of Quantum Indeterminacy (2020). urltoken

Quantum indeterminacy is the apparent necessary incompleteness in the description of a physical system, that has become one of the characteristics of the standard description of quantum physics. Prior to quantum physics, it was thought that 
:(a) a physical system had a determinate state which uniquely determined all the values of its measurable properties, and conversely
:(b) the values of its measurable properties uniquely determined the state.
Quantum indeterminacy can be quantitatively characterized by a probability distribution on the set of outcomes of measurements of an observable. The distribution is uniquely determined by the system state, and moreover quantum mechanics provides a recipe for calculating this probability distribution.
Indeterminacy in measurement was not an innovation of quantum mechanics, since it had been established early on by experimentalists that errors in measurement may lead to indeterminate outcomes. However, by the later half of the eighteenth century, measurement errors were well understood and it was known that they could either be reduced by better equipment or accounted for by statistical error models. In quantum mechanics, however, indeterminacy is of a much more fundamental nature, having nothing to do with errors or disturbance.
