Thomas Sowell

=== Late-talking and the Einstein syndrome ===
Sowell wrote The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late, a follow-up to his Late-Talking Children, discussing a condition he termed the Einstein syndrome. This book investigates the phenomenon of late-talking children, frequently misdiagnosed with autism or pervasive developmental disorder. He includes the research of Stephen Camarata and Steven Pinker, among others, in this overview of a poorly understood developmental trait. It is a trait which he says affected many historical figures who developed prominent careers, such as physicists Albert Einstein,<ref>Wolff, Barbara, and Hananya Goodman. " urltoken The Legend of the Dull-Witted Child Who Grew Up to Be a Genius." Albert Einstein Archives. IS: Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</ref> Edward Teller, and Richard Feynman; mathematician Julia Robinson; and musicians Arthur Rubinstein and Clara Schumann. He makes the case for the theory that some children develop unevenly (asynchronous development) for a period in childhood due to rapid and extraordinary development in the analytical functions of the brain. This may temporarily "rob resources" from neighboring functions such as language development. As such, Sowell disagrees with Simon Baron-Cohen's speculation that Einstein may have had Asperger syndrome.<ref name="Einstein" />
=== Politics ===
In a Townhall editorial, titled "The Bush Legacy", Sowell assessed President George W. Bush as "a mixed bag" but "an honorable man."<ref></ref> Sowell was strongly critical of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and officially endorsed Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries in a February article.<ref></ref> However, he indicated that he would vote in the general election against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, due to fears about the appointments Clinton would possibly make to the Supreme Court.<ref></ref>
In 2020, Sowell wrote that if the Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, it could signal a point of no return for the United States, a tipping point akin to the fall of the Roman Empire. In an interview in July 2020, he stated that "the Roman Empire overcame many problems in its long history but eventually it reached a point where it could no longer continue on, and much of that was from within, not just the barbarians attacking from outside." Sowell wrote that if Biden became President, the Democratic Party would have a huge amount of control over the country and if this happened, they could twin with the "radical left" and ideas such as defunding the police could come to fruition.<ref name="Creitz" /><ref></ref>
==== Donald Trump ====
Two weeks before the 2016 presidential election, Sowell urged voters to vote for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. In 2018, when asked on his thoughts of Trump's presidency, Sowell replied "I think he's better than the previous president."<ref>Malagisi, Christopher, host. 23 April 2018.

US: The Conservative Book Club.</ref>
In March 2019, Sowell commented on the public's response to mainstream media's allegations that Trump is a racist: "What's tragic is that there's so many people out there who simply respond to words rather than ask themselves 'Is what this person says true? How can I check it?' And so on."<ref>" urltoken Sowell: Politicians using race as their ticket to whatever racket they're running." The Ingraham Angle. Fox News. March 6, 2019. via YouTube.</ref> A month later, Sowell again defended Trump against media charges of racism, stating: "I've seen no hard evidence. And, unfortunately, we’re living in a time where no one expects hard evidence. You just repeat some familiar words and people will react pretty much the way Pavlov's Dog was conditioned to react to certain sounds."<ref>Sowell, Thomas. March 22, 2019.

=== Education ===
Sowell has written about education throughout his career. He has argued for the need for reform of the school system in the United States. In his latest book, Charter Schools and Their Enemies (2020), Sowell compares the educational outcomes of school children educated at charter schools with those at conventional public schools. In his research, Sowell first explains the need and his methodology for choosing comparable students—both ethnically and socioeconomically—before listing his findings. He presents the case that charter schools on the whole do significantly better in terms of educational outcomes than conventional schools.<ref></ref><ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />
Sowell also writes about the importance of education for young people. He argues that many schools are failing children in their educations. This is for numerous reasons among which he argues are that indoctrination has taken the place of proper education, teaching unions have been making unfair money out of schools and that many schools have become monopolies for educational bureaucracies.<ref></ref>
In his book, Education: Assumptions Versus History (1986), Sowell analyzes the state of education in US schools and universities. In particular, he examines the experiences of blacks and other ethnic groups in the American education system and identifies the factors and patterns behind both success and failure.<ref></ref>
== Reception ==
Classical liberals, libertarians, and conservatives of different disciplines have received Sowell's work positively.<ref name="CM-Peerless" /><ref name="NatRev-Chew" /><ref name="Forbes2" /><ref> Higgins describes Sowell as having written a "brilliant trilogy on culture and societies (Race and Culture, Migrations and Culture, and Conquests and Culture). . His stature must be attributed to his ability to bring light where there is darkness and logic where there is confusion to public policy in general and economics in particular."</ref> Among these, he has been noted for originality, great depth and breadth,<ref name="TS:Seeing" /><ref name="NNC" /> clarity of expression, and thoroughness of research.<ref name="Forbes" /><ref name="NNC" /><ref name=":6" />
Sowell's publications have been received positively by economists Steven Plaut<ref name=":6" /> and Abigail Thernstrom;<ref name="NatRev-Think" /> Political science Charles Murray;<ref name="TS:Seeing" /> psychologists Steven Pinker<ref></ref><ref></ref> and Jonathan Haidt;<ref></ref><ref></ref> Josef Joffe, publisher and editor of Die Zeit;<ref name="NNC" /> Jay Nordlinger, Senior Editor of National Review;<ref name="NatRev-Chew" /> theater critic and political commentator Kevin D. Williamson;<ref name="CM-Peerless" /> Walter E. Williams, professor of economics at George Mason University;<ref></ref> and publishing executive Steve Forbes.<ref name="Forbes2" />
Other academics such as Hampton University economist Bernadette Chachere, Harvard University Sociology William Julius Wilson, social scientist Richard Coughlin, and Stanford law professor Richard Thompson Ford have been critical of some of his work in book reviews. Criticisms include failure to take into account discrimination against women at work in Rhetoric or Reality?; the lack of a coherent methodology in Race and Culture: A World View; and Caricature and then attacking Liberal theory in Intellectuals and Race.<ref name="link.springer.com" /><ref name="Wilson 1984" /><ref name="Ford" /><ref></ref>

In Intellectuals and Race (2013), Sowell argues that intelligence quotient (IQ) gaps are hardly startling or unusual between, or within, ethnic groups. He notes that the roughly 15-point Black-white IQ gap is similar to that between the national average and the scores of certain White ethnic in years past, in periods when the nation was absorbing new immigrants.
