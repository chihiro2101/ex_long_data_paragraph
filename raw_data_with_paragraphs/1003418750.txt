==Education==
The city's public school students do not all attend the same schools, because West Virginia school districts are divided strictly along county lines, without regard to city boundaries.
Kanawha County residents are served by the following schools in the city:
* Nitro Elementary School (public)
* Nitro High School (public)
There is no public middle school in Nitro on either side of the county line, nor is there any public school within the Putnam County portion of the city. Middle school students in Kanawha County must bus to Andrew Jackson Middle School in Cross Lanes. Putnam County students must bus to Rock Branch Elementary, Poca Middle, and Poca High.
==Environment==
The reach of the Kanawha River Valley between Belle and Nitro is known locally as the "Chemical Valley", which, at its peak in the late 1950s and early 1960s, was the leading producer of chemicals in the world (Henry, 1974). During World WarI the government built an $80 million complex in Nitro to manufacture explosives and chemicals for the war effort.
The site was located on an cow pasture on the Kanawha River on the flat river valley floodplain. The facility had just been placed in operation when the war ended in November 1918. The first shipment of powder was also the last. Local authorities then sought various chemical companies to occupy the facility which had excellent infrastructure in utilities, transportation and new housing for workers. It was hoped that the former gunpowder complex would become a major chemical manufacturing center, especially for the emerging dye industry in the U.S. that relied on coal and coke by-products as feedstock.
The Kanawha River and water in the adjacent alluvium have been adversely affected by industrial activities (Messinger, 1997).<ref> urltoken 
The chemical manufacturing history of Nitro resulted in environmental impairment, including the Fike/Artel Chemical Site (EPA ID: WVD047989207), which is on the National Priorities List Superfund. The site was placed on the EPA National Priorities List in 1983. The site is a former World WarI chemical munitions plant at which subsequent chemical manufacturing, reclamation and disposal was allegedly conducted.
The Solutia Inc. Nitro Plant, located on the east bank of the Kanawha River approximately one-half mile north of the City of Nitro in Putnam County, is being investigated through the RCRA program. From 1918 to 1921, the facility manufactured explosives including "nitro-powder" to support World WarI. When explosives manufacturing processes ceased, the facility was purchased and used for a variety of industries. RCRA Corrective Action activities at this facility are being conducted under the direction of EPA Region 3 and the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection.<ref>Region 3 GPRA Baseline RCRA Corrective Action Facility, urltoken 
Other RCRA Corrective Action facilities include Great Lakes Chemicals Company (formerly FMC Corporation) <ref>Region 3 GRPA Baseline RCRA Corrective Action Facility, urltoken and Union Carbide Corp. - PTO (a subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company).<ref></ref>
Due to manufacturing activities, Nitro became known for a distinctive chemical smellâ€”especially in the area of the I-64 bridge. However, the recent shift away from manufacturing in the region has significantly reduced air pollution issues.
===Agent Orange===
In February 2012, Monsanto agreed to settle a case covering dioxin contamination around a plant in Nitro that had made Agent Orange. Monsanto agreed to pay up to $9 million for cleanup of affected homes, $84 million for medical monitoring of people affected, and the community's legal fees.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
===Scientific Research Activities===
In 2001 Clonaid operated a lab in Nitro that was tied to the Raelians. It was located inside a rented room within a former high school. The FDA said that the equipment in the lab was state-of-the-art and had been bought by former West Virginia state legislator Mark Hunt.<ref name="For Clonaid, a Trail of Unproven Claims"> urltoken For Clonaid, a Trail of Unproven Claims, New York Times.
