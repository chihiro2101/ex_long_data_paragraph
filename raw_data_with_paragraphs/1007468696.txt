Self-driving car

== History ==
Experiments have been conducted on automated driving systems (ADS) since at least the 1920s;<ref></ref> trials began in the 1950s. The first semi-automated car was developed in 1977, by Japan's Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, which required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer. The vehicle reached speeds up to with the support of an elevated rail.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
A landmark autonomous car appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab<ref></ref> and ALV<ref></ref><ref></ref> projects funded by the United States' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) starting in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987.<ref name="idsia"></ref> By 1985, the ALV had demonstrated self-driving speeds on two-lane roads of , with obstacle avoidance added in 1986, and off-road driving in day and nighttime conditions by 1987.<ref></ref> A major milestone was achieved in 1995, with CMU's Navlab completing the first autonomous coast-to-coast drive of the United States. Of the between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and San Diego, California, were autonomous (98.2%), completed with an average speed of .<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> From the 1960s through the second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005, automated vehicle research in the United States was primarily funded by DARPA, the US Army, and the US Navy, yielding incremental advances in speeds, driving competence in more complex conditions, controls, and sensor systems.<ref></ref> Companies and research organizations have developed prototypes.<ref name="idsia" /><ref name="BoschAutomatedDriving"></ref><ref name="CarMakerOne"></ref><ref name="CarMakerTwo"></ref><ref name="ToyotaBot"></ref><ref name="GoogleOnWheels"></ref><ref name="Vislab_electric_autonomous_car"></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
The US allocated US$650 million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System, which demonstrated automated driving through a combination of automation embedded in the highway with automated technology in vehicles, and cooperative networking between the vehicles and with the highway infrastructure. The program concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 but without clear direction or funding to implement the system on a larger scale.<ref></ref> Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, the Carnegie Mellon University Navlab drove across America in 1995, or 98% of it autonomously.<ref></ref> Navlab's record achievement stood unmatched for two decades until 2015, when Delphi improved it by piloting an Audi, augmented with Delphi technology, over through 15 states while remaining in self-driving mode 99% of the time.<ref></ref> In 2015, the US states of Nevada, Florida, California, Virginia, and Michigan, together with Washington, DC, allowed the testing of automated cars on public roads.<ref></ref>
From 2016 to 2018, the European Commission funded an innovation strategy development for connected and automated driving through the Coordination Actions CARTRE and SCOUT.<ref></ref> Moreover, the Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA) Roadmap for Connected and Automated Transport was published in 2019.<ref></ref>
In November 2017, Waymo announced that it had begun testing driverless cars without a safety driver in the driver position;<ref></ref> however, there was still an employee in the car.<ref></ref> In October 2018, Waymo announced that its test vehicles had traveled in automated mode for over , increasing by about per month.<ref></ref> In December 2018, Waymo was the first to commercialize a fully autonomous taxi service in the US, in Phoenix, Arizona.<ref></ref> In October 2020, Waymo's service was opened to the public.<ref name="ars-waymo-public"></ref>
In 2020, a National Transportation Safety Board chairman stated that no self-driving cars (SAE level 3+) were available for consumers to purchase in the US in 2020:

In 2017, the South Korean government stated that the lack of universal standards is preventing its own legislation from pushing new domestic rules. However, once the international standards are settled, South Korea's legislation will resemble the international standards.<ref></ref>

Australia also has some ongoing trials.<ref> urltoken 
===Liability===
Self-driving car liability is a developing area of law and policy that will determine who is liable when an automated car causes physical damage to persons, or breaks road rules.<ref name=":5" /><ref></ref> When automated cars shift the control of driving from humans to automated car technology the driver will need to consent to share operational responsibility<ref></ref> which will require a legal framework. There may be a need for existing liability laws to evolve in order to fairly identify the parties responsible for damage and injury, and to address the potential for conflicts of interest between human occupants, system operator, insurers, and the public purse.<ref name="RAND"/> Increases in the use of automated car technologies (e.g. advanced driver-assistance systems) may prompt incremental shifts in this responsibility for driving. It is claimed by proponents to have potential to affect the frequency of road accidents, although it is difficult to assess this claim in the absence of data from substantial actual use.<ref></ref> If there was a dramatic improvement in safety, the operators may seek to project their liability for the remaining accidents onto others as part of their reward for the improvement. However, there is no obvious reason why they should escape liability if any such effects were found to be modest or nonexistent, since part of the purpose of such liability is to give an incentive to the party controlling something to do whatever is necessary to avoid it causing harm. Potential users may be reluctant to trust an operator if it seeks to pass its normal liability on to others.
In any case, a well-advised person who is not controlling a car at all (Level 5) would be understandably reluctant to accept liability for something out of their control. And when there is some degree of sharing control possible (Level 3 or 4), a well-advised person would be concerned that the vehicle might try to pass back control at the last seconds before an accident, to pass responsibility and liability back too, but in circumstances where the potential driver has no better prospects of avoiding the crash than the vehicle, since they have not necessarily been paying close attention, and if it is too hard for the very smart car it might be too hard for a human. Since operators, especially those familiar with trying to ignore existing legal obligations (under a motto like 'seek forgiveness, not permission'), such as Waymo or Uber, could be normally expected to try to avoid responsibility to the maximum degree possible, there is potential for attempt to let the operators evade being held liable for accidents while they are in control.
As higher levels of automation are commercially introduced (Level 3 and 4), the insurance industry may see a greater proportion of commercial and product liability lines while personal automobile insurance shrinks.<ref name="KPMG"></ref>
When it comes to the direction of fully autonomous car liability, torts cannot be ignored. In any car accident the issue of negligence usually arises. In the situation of autonomous cars, negligence would most likely fall on the manufacturer because it would be hard to pin a breach of duty of care on the user who isn't in control of the vehicle. The only time negligence was brought up in an autonomous car lawsuit, there was a settlement between the person struck by the autonomous vehicle and the manufacturer (General Motors). Next, product liability would most likely cause liability to fall on the manufacturer. For an accident to fall under product liability, there needs to be either a defect, failure to provide adequate warnings, or foreseeability by the manufacturer.<ref></ref> Third, is strict liability which in this case is similar to product liability based on the design defect. Based on a Nevada Supreme Court ruling (Ford vs. Trejo) the plaintiff needs to prove failure of the manufacturer to pass the consumer expectation test.<ref></ref> That is potentially how the three major torts could function when it comes to autonomous car liability.

; Level 2
Between manually driven vehicles (SAE Level 0) and fully autonomous vehicles (SAE Level 5), there are a variety of vehicle types that can be described to have some degree of automation. These are collectively known as semi-automated vehicles. As it could be a while before the technology and infrastructure are developed for full automation, it is likely that vehicles will have increasing levels of automation. These semi-automated vehicles could potentially harness many of the advantages of fully automated vehicles, while still keeping the driver in charge of the vehicle.<ref></ref>
In December 2015, Tesla CEO Elon Musk predicted that a completely automated car would be introduced by the end of 2018;<ref></ref> in December 2017, he announced that it would take another two years to launch a fully self-driving Tesla onto the market.<ref></ref>
Waymo launched a ride hailing service in Phoenix in December, 2018. Drive.ai is doing a trial run in Frisco, Texas and Arlington Texas.
In March 2019, ahead of the autonomous racing series Roborace, Robocar set the Guinness World Record for being the fastest autonomous car in the world. In pushing the limits of self-driving vehicles, Robocar reached 282.42&nbsp;km/h (175.49&nbsp;mph) â€“ an average confirmed by the UK Timing Association at Elvington in Yorkshire, UK.<ref></ref>
; Level 3
In 2020, Daimler launched the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W223) with software ready to be downloaded over the air as soon as law permits level3 ALKS in 2021.
Also in 2020, Honda claims to be granted the safety certification by Japanese government to their autonomous "Traffic Jam Pilot" driving technology, which legally allow drivers to take their eyes off the road. Honda plans to launch the new Honda Legend equipped with the newly approved automated driving equipment by no later than March 2021.
In December 2020, BMW is expected to tries 7 Series as automated car in public urban motorways of United-states, Germany and Israel before commercializing them later.<ref> urltoken BMW Details Plan For Fully Automated Driving By 2021</ref>

=== In literature ===
Intelligent or self-driving cars are a common theme in science fiction literature. Examples include:
* In Isaac Asimov's science-fiction short story, "Sally" (first published Mayâ€“June 1953), automated cars have "positronic brains" and communicate via honking horns and slamming doors, and save their human caretaker. Due to the high cost of the brain, few can afford a personal vehicle, so buses have become the norm.
* Peter F. Hamilton's Commonwealth Saga series features intelligent or self-driving vehicles.
* In Robert A Heinlein's novel, The Number of the Beast (1980), Zeb Carter's driving and flying car "Gay Deceiver" is at first semi-automated and later, after modifications by Zeb's wife Deety, becomes sentient and capable of fully autonomous operation.
* In Edizioni Piemme's series Geronimo Stilton, a robotic vehicle called "Solar" is in the 54th book.
* Alastair Reynolds' series, Revelation Space, features intelligent or self-driving vehicles.
* In Daniel Suarez' novels Daemon (2006) and Freedomâ„¢ (2010) driverless cars and motorcycles are used for attacks in a software-based open-source warfare. The vehicles are modified for this using 3D printers and distributed manufacturing<ref></ref> and are also able to operate as swarms.
=== In television ===
* "Gone in 60 Seconds", season 2, episode 6 of 2015 TV series CSI: Cyber features three seemingly normal customized vehicles, a 2009 Nissan Fairlady Z Roadster, a BMW M3 E90 and a Cadillac CTS-V, and one stock luxury BMW 7 Series, being remote-controlled by a computer hacker.
* "Handicar", season 18, episode 4 of 2014 TV series South Park features a Japanese automated car that takes part in the Wacky Races-style car race.
* KITT and KARR, the Pontiac Trans Ams in the 1982 TV series Knight Rider, were sentient and autonomous. The KITT and KARR based Ford Mustangs from Knight Rider were also sentient and autonomous, like their Firebird counterparts.
* "Driven", series 4, episode 11 of the 2003 TV series NCIS features a robotic vehicle named "Otto", part of a high-level project of the Department of Defense, which causes the death of a Navy Lieutenant, and then later almost kills Abby.

This allows the car to drive itself but also causes it to go rogue and chase down Rico. It was eventually destroyed and rebuilt a second time, reverting it back to an ordinary car.

A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous vehicle (AV or auto), driverless car, or robo-car<ref name=":5"></ref><ref></ref><ref name="thrun2010toward"></ref> is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input.<ref name="Platoon" /><ref></ref>
Self-driving cars combine a variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as radar, lidar, sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units.<ref name=":5" /><ref name="Platoon"></ref> Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.<ref name="Platoon" /><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref name=":7"></ref>
Possible implementations of the technology include personal self-driving vehicles, shared robotaxis, connected vehicle platoons and long-distance trucking.<ref name="Platoon" /> Several projects to develop a fully self-driving commercial car are in various stages of development. Waymo became the first service provider to offer robotaxi rides to the general public in Phoenix, Arizona in 2020, while Tesla has said it will offer subscription-based "full self-driving" to private vehicle owners in 2021.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Furthermore, the autonomous delivery company Nuro has been allowed to start commercial operations in California starting in 2021.<ref></ref>
