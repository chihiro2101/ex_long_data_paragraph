Demonic possession

==Abrahamic religions==
=== Judaism ===
The Catholic Encyclopedia says that there is only one apparent case of demonic possession in the Old Testament, of King Saul being tormented by an "evil spirit" (1 Samuel 16:14), but it relies on an interpretation of the Hebrew word "rûah" as "evil spirit", an interpretation that is doubted by the Catholic Encyclopedia. In addition, Saul was only described to be tormented, rather than possessed, and he was relieved from these torments by having David play the lyre to him.<ref></ref> Some theologians such as Ángel Manuel Rodríguez say that mediums like the ones mentioned in Leviticus 20:27 were possessed by demons. Another possible case of demonic possession in the Old Testament includes the false prophets that king Ahab relied upon before re-capturing Ramoth-Gilead in 1 Kings 22. They were described to be empowered by a deceiving spirit.<ref></ref>
According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, Jewish methods of exorcism were described in the extrabiblical Book of Tobit.<ref name="CathEncy|wstitle=Exorcism"></ref><ref name=":2"></ref>
In the 16th century, Isaac Luria, a Jewish mystic, wrote about the transmigration of souls seeking perfection. His disciples took his idea a step further, creating the idea of a dybbuk, a soul inhabiting a victim until it had accomplished its task or atoned for its sin.<ref></ref> The dybbuk appears in Jewish folklore and literature, as well as in chronicles of Jewish life.<ref></ref>
=== Christianity ===
From its beginning,<ref name=":0" /> Christianity has held that possession derives from the Devil, i.e. Satan, his lesser demons, the fallen angels.<ref name=":1"></ref> In the battle between Satan and Heaven, one of Satan's strategies is to possess humans.<ref name=":0" /> The New Testament mentions several episodes in which Miracles of Jesus#Exorcisms.<ref name=":1" /> Whilst most Christians believe that demonic possession is an involuntary affliction,<ref>Malachi M. (1976) Hostage to the Devil: the possession and exorcism of five living Americans. San Francisco, Harpercollins p.462 </ref> there are Biblical verses that suggest that demon possession is voluntary. An example of this is Judas Iscariot, who fell under the Devil's possession in John 13:27 because he continually agreed to the Devil's suggestions to betray Jesus and wholly submitted to him.<ref></ref>
==== Catholicism ====
Catholic exorcists differentiate between "ordinary" Satanic/demonic activity or influence (mundane everyday temptations) and "extraordinary" Satanic/demonic activity, which can take six different forms, ranging from complete control by Satan or demons to voluntary submission:<ref></ref>
#Possession, in which Satan or demons take full possession of a person's body without their consent. This possession usually comes as a result of a person's actions; actions that lead to an increased susceptibility to Satan's influence. 
#Obsession, which includes sudden attacks of irrationally obsessive thoughts, usually culminating in suicidal ideation, and which typically influences dreams.
#Oppression, in which there is no loss of consciousness or involuntary action, such as in the biblical Book of Job in which Job was tormented by Satan through a series of misfortunes in business, material possessions, family, and health.
#External physical pain caused by Satan or demons.
#Infestation, which affects houses, objects/things, or animals; and
#Subjection, in which a person voluntarily submits to Satan or demons.
In the Roman Ritual, true demonic or satanic possession has been characterized since the Middle Ages, by the following four typical characteristics:<ref>p.25, The Vatican's Exorcists by Tracy Wilkinson; Warner Books, New York, 2007</ref><ref>The Rite: The Making of a Modern Exorcist by Matt Baglio; Doubleday, New York, 2009.</ref>
# Manifestation of superhuman strength.
#Speaking in tongues or languages that the victim cannot know.
#Revelation of knowledge, distant or hidden, that the victim cannot know.
#Blasphemy rage, obscene hand gestures, using profanity and an aversion to holy symbols and names, relics or places.
The New Catholic Encyclopedia states, "Ecclesiastical authorities are reluctant to admit diabolical possession in most cases, because many can be explained by physical or mental illness alone. Therefore, medical and psychological examinations are necessary before the performance of major exorcism. The standard that must be met is that of moral certitude (De exorcismis, 16). For an exorcist to be morally certain, or beyond reasonable doubt, that he is dealing with a genuine case of demonic possession, there must be no other reasonable explanation for the phenomena in question."<ref></ref> 
The New Testament (of The Holy Bible) indicates that people can be possessed by demons, but that the demons respond and submit to Jesus Christ's authority:
<sup>33</sup>In the synagogue, there was a man possessed by a demon, an evil spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice, <sup>34</sup>"Ha! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God! "<sup>35</sup>"Be quiet!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!" Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him. <sup>36</sup>All the people were amazed and said to each other, "What is this teaching? With authority and power he gives orders to evil spirits and they come out!" <sup>37</sup>And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area. (Luke 4:33-35 NIV)<ref name=":3" />
It also indicates that demons can possess animals as in the exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac.<ref name=":3"></ref>
Official Catholic doctrine affirms that demonic possession can occur as distinguished from mental illness,<ref name=":4"></ref> but stresses that cases of mental illness should not be misdiagnosed as demonic influence. Catholic exorcisms can occur only under the authority of a bishop and in accordance with strict rules; a simple exorcism also occurs during baptism.<ref name=":0" />
====Protestantism====
The infliction of demonic torment upon an individual has been chronicled in premodern Protestant literature. In 1597, King James discussed four methods of daemonic influence upon an individual in his book Daemonologie:<ref></ref>
#Spectra, being the haunting and troubling of certain houses or solitary places.
#Obsession, the following and outwardly torment of an individual at diverse hours to either weaken or cast diseases upon the body, as in the book of Job.
#Possession, the entrance inwardly into an individual to beget uncontrollable fits, induce blasphemies, 
#Faerie, being the influence those who voluntarily submit to consort, prophesy, or servitude.
King James attested that the symptoms derived from demonic possession could be discernible from natural diseases. He rejected the symptoms and signs prescribed by the Catholic church as vain (e.g. rage begotten from Holy Water, fear of the Cross, etc.) and found that the exorcism rites to be troublesome and ineffective to recite. The Rites of the Catholic Church to remedy the torment of demonic spirits were rejected as counterfeit since few possessed could be cured by them. James therefore declared the Protestant view of casting out devils, "It is easy then to understand that the casting out of Devils, is by the virtue of fasting and prayer, and in-calling of the name of God, suppose many imperfections be in the person that is the instrument, as CHRIST himself teaches us (Mat. 7) of the power that false Prophets all have cast out devils." <ref></ref>
In both charismatic and evangelical Christianity, exorcisms of demons are often carried out by individuals or groups belong to the Deliverance ministry movement.<ref></ref> Symptoms of such possessions, according to these groups, can include chronic fatigue syndrome, homosexuality, addiction to pornography, and alcoholism.<ref></ref>
==Medicine and psychology==
Those who profess a belief in demonic possession, also referred to as possessive trance disorder,<ref name=":0" /> have sometimes conflated possession with the symptoms associated with physical or mental illnesses, such as hysteria, Tourette syndrome, epilepsy,<ref name="pfeifer">Pfeifer, S. (1994). Belief in demons and exorcism in psychiatric patients in Switzerland. British Journal of Medical Psychology 4 247-258.</ref> schizophrenia,<ref></ref> conversion disorder or dissociative identity disorder.<ref></ref> In its article on Dissociative Identity Disorder, the DSM-5 states, "Possession-form identities in dissociative identity disorder typically manifest as behaviors that appear as if a 'spirit,' supernatural being, or outside person has taken control such that the individual begins speaking or acting in a distinctly different manner.<ref></ref>" It is not uncommon to ascribe the experience of sleep paralysis to demonic possession, although it's not a physical or mental illness.<ref name="barry">Barry Beyerstein. (1995). Dissociative States: Possession and Exorcism. In Gordon Stein (ed.). The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. pp. 544-552. </ref> The symptoms vary across cultures.<ref></ref> Demonic possession is not a valid psychiatry or medical diagnosis recognized by either the DSM-5 or the ICD-10.<ref name="henderson">Henderson, J. (1981). Exorcism and Possession in Psychotherapy Practice. The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry 27: 129-134.</ref> The DSM-5 indicates that personality states of dissociative identity disorder may be interpreted as possession in some cultures, and instances of spirit possession are often related to traumatic experiences—suggesting that possession experiences may be caused by mental distress.<ref name="lars"></ref> Some have expressed concern that belief in demonic possession can limit access to health care for the mentally ill.<ref name="karanci"></ref> Studies have found that alleged demonic possessions can be related to trauma.<ref name="lars" />

Demonic possession involves the belief that a spirit, demon, or other entity can control a person's actions.<ref name=":0"></ref> Those who believe themselves to be possessed commonly claim that symptoms of demonic possession include missing memories, perceptual distortions, loss of a sense of control, and hyper-suggestibility.<ref></ref> Erika Bourguignon found in a study of 488 societies worldwide that seventy-four percent believe in spirit possession, with the highest numbers of believing societies in Pacific cultures and the lowest incidence among Native Americans of both North and South America.<ref>
