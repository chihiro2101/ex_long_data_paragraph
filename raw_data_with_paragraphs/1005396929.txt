== China Burma India Theater ==
The China Burma India Theater served more as an Administrative Command rather than a Theater of Operations and lacked any true Operational Command. The Operational Command was joint Allied South East Asia Command in the South-East Asian Theater. The American General Joseph Stilwell commanded the operational Northern Combat Area Command and used his other positions to communicate directly with Joint Chiefs of Staff about operational matters.
