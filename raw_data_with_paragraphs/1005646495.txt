Tradesman

==History==
In Victorian England:
:The terms "skilled worker," "craftsman," "artisan," and "tradesman" were used in senses that overlap. All describe people with specialized training in the skills needed for a particular kind of work. Some of them produced goods that they sold from their own premises (e.g. bootmakers, saddlers, hatmakers, jewelers, glassblowers); others (e.g. typesetters, bookbinders, wheelwrights) were employed to do one part of the production in a business that required a variety of skilled workers. Still others were factory hands who had become experts in some complex part of the process and could command high wages and steady employment. Skilled workers in the building trades (e.g. carpenters, masons, Plumber, painters, plasterers, glaziers) were also referred to by one or another of these terms.<ref>Sally Mitchell, Daily Life in Victorian England (Greenwood: 1996), p. 60.</ref>
One study of Caversham, New Zealand at the turn of the century notes that a skilled trade was considered a trade that required an apprenticeship to entry.<ref name="Olssen">Erik Olssen, Building the New World: Work, Politics, and Society in Caversham, 1880s-1920s (Auckland University Press, 1995), pp. 47-49.</ref> Skilled tradesmen worked either in traditional handicraft workshops or newer factories that emerged during the Industrial Revolution.<ref name="Olssen"/> Traditional handicraft roles included, for example: "sail-maker, candle-maker, cooper, japanner, lapidary and taxidermist, canister-maker, furrier, cap-maker, dobbin-maker, French polish, baker, miller, brewer, confectioner, watch-maker, tinsmith, glazier, maltster, wood-turner, saddler, shipwright, scale-maker, engraver and cutler."<ref name="Olssen"/>
==Modern use and list of skilled trades==
Tradesmen are contrasted with unskilled workers, Agriculture workers, and professionals (those in the learned professions).<ref>Whitney, William D., ed. "Trade." Def, 7. The Century Dictionary: An Encyclopedic Lexicon of the English Language vol. 8. New York. The Century Co. 1895. 6,415.</ref> Skilled tradesmen are distinguished:
* from unskilled workers such as bus drivers, truck drivers, and landscapers in that the unskilled workers "rely heavily on physical exertion" while those in the skilled trades rely on "specific knowledge, skills, and abilities."<ref name="CampbellRamos">Wanda J. Campbell & Robert A. Ramos, "Blue-collar Selection in Private Sector Organizations" in Handbook of Employee Selection (eds. James L. Farr, Nancy T. Tippins: Taylor & Francis 2010), p. 741.</ref> Both types of work, however, are considered blue-collar.<ref name="CampbellRamos"/> 
* from Professional in that the professionals require more education and have a higher duty of care<ref>Robert D. Sprauge, "Liability for System and Data Quality" in Social, Ethical and Policy Implications of Information Technology (eds. Linda L. Brennan & Victoria Elizabeth Johnson: Idea Group: 2004), p. 194)</ref> and routinely make decisions "on the basis of expertise and ability in complex situations where there may be no, or little, previous history."<ref>Christopher Lawless, Forensic Science: A Sociological Introduction (Routledge, 2016), p. 62.</ref>
There is no definitive list of modern skilled trades, as definitions vary, with some lists being broader than others.<ref name="MichReport"> urltoken Employment and Occupations in the Skilled Trades in Michigan, Michigan Department of Technology, Management, and Budget, Bureau of Labor Market Information and Strategic Initiatives (June 2013).</ref>
A June 2013 report by the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget, however, generated the following list of trades (divided into industrial, construction, and service skilled trades), along with their Standard Occupational Classification System code:<ref name="MichReport"/>

==Earnings and social standing==
A British study found that, after taking student loan repayments into account, a higher apprenticeship (at level 5 in the national qualifications frameworks) delivered higher lifetime median earnings than a degree from a university outside the Russell Group. Despite this, polling for the report found that apprenticeships have a lower perceived value than bachelor's degrees.<ref></ref>
Data from the United States shows that, although vocational education is usually less financially lucrative in the long term than a bachelor's degree, it can still provide a respectable income at much less cost in time and money. Even ten years after graduation, there are many people with a certificate or associate degree who earn more money than those with a B.A.<ref></ref>

A tradesman, skilled tradesman, or tradie refers to a skilled worker who specializes in a particular occupation that requires work experience, on-the-job training, and often formal vocational education, but not a bachelor's degree.
As opposed to a craftsman or an artisan the occupation of a tradesman is not necessarily restricted to manual work.
