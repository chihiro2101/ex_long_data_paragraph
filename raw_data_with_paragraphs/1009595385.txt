Mark Hoppus

===Beginnings of music career===
After moving to San Diego in the summer of 1992, Hoppus was reunited with his sister Anne Hoppus, to whom he expressed his desire to be in a band.<ref name="halfnakedtruth"/> Anne attended Rancho Bernardo High School, and had become friends with new student Tom DeLonge over the summer.<ref name="TalesFromBeneathYourMom"/> In August 1992, Anne introduced the two, and Hoppus and DeLonge immediately began performing music in DeLonge's garage.<ref name="halfnakedtruth"/> To impress DeLonge, Hoppus climbed to the top of a streetlight outside of DeLonge's home – however, he broke both ankles on the way down, resulting in being in crutches for the next few weeks.<ref name=p8-9>Hoppus, 2001. pp. 8–9</ref> DeLonge recalled the meeting in 2000: "When I first met Mark, we were running around naked, doing weird stuff. We were up skateboarding until late hours of the morning, antagonizing security guards, and we were just always having fun."<ref name="enemaofthestage"></ref> DeLonge recruited old friend Scott Raynor from his days at Poway to become the drummer for the new band, named blink.
Hoppus and his girlfriend at this time lived in a basement apartment, barely scraping together funds to pay rent. With money in savings, Hoppus went out and bought his first professional equipment: a new amp and bass cabinet. He came home and his girlfriend proceeded to argue with him, angry that he spent money on something they did not need. "I just kept telling her that this was what mattered to me, this was my life," Hoppus recalled. She demanded he make a choice between the band and her, which resulted in Hoppus leaving the band shortly after formation.<ref name=p13-15>Hoppus, 2001. pp. 13–15</ref> Shortly thereafter, DeLonge told Hoppus he had borrowed a four track recorder from a friend and was preparing to record a demo tape, which prompted Hoppus to break up with his girlfriend and return to the band. Flyswatter—a combination of original songs and punk covers—was recorded in Raynor's bedroom and landed the band their first shows.<ref name=p16>Hoppus, 2001. p. 16</ref> Three more demos were recorded over the course of 1993 and the band began performing its irreverent live show at local all-ages venue SOMA, which alerted local independent label Cargo Music.<ref name=p245>Hoppus, 2001. p.&nbsp;24–25</ref> Cargo signed the band on a trial basis, and Hoppus was the only member to sign the contract, as DeLonge was at work at the time and Raynor was still a minor.<ref name=p30>Hoppus, 2001. p. 30</ref> During this time, Hoppus lived at home in San Diego at his mother's, where the band would prepare cassette demos and the entire family would fold cassette inserts. Raynor, whose parents moved to Reno, Nevada, stayed with Hoppus in summer 1994.<ref name=p28>Hoppus, 2001. p. 28</ref>
Blink's first album, Cheshire Cat (1995), was a strong seller for the independent band and would come to be regarded as iconic within the skate punk scene.<ref name="MTV influence"/> In 1995, the band signed on for their first national tour, which extended as far as the East Coast. The band purchased their own tour van and embarked on the GoodTimes tour with Unwritten Law, Sprung Monkey and 7 Seconds.<ref name=p44>Hoppus, 2001. p. 44</ref> The band slowly built a young, devoted following with indie recordings and an endless series of performances and various clubs and festivals.<ref name=rsency>Romanowski, Patricia. George-Warren, Holly. Pareles, Jon. (2001). The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll (Revised and Updated for the 21st Century). New York: Touchstone, 1136 pp. First edition, 2001.</ref> MCA Records signed the band in 1996 and would co-distribute their next release, the sophomore effort Dude Ranch. Hoppus penned the record's lead single, "Dammit", which became a nationwide rock radio hit single as the band toured on the Vans Warped Tour.<ref name=p70>Hoppus, 2001. p. 70</ref><ref name=billboard></ref>
===Multiplatinum success===
Hoppus grew increasingly lonely on these tours, having no significant other while other band members did.<ref name="halfnakedtruth"/> The exhaustive schedule created tensions within the band, who would fire Raynor in the summer of 1998 in mysterious circumstances never fully explained.<ref name=p81>Hoppus, 2001. p. 81</ref> With new drummer Travis Barker behind the kit, the trio hit the studio with producer Jerry Finn and recorded Enema of the State, which launched the band's career, catapulting them into the "stratosphere of pop music" and solidifying them as the biggest pop punk act of the era.<ref name="MTV influence"></ref><ref name=totalguitar></ref> Three singles were released from the record—"What's My Age Again?", "All the Small Things", and "Adam's Song"—that crossed over into Top 40 radio format and experienced major commercial success.<ref name=p96>Hoppus, 2001. p. 96</ref> Hoppus got married in 2000 (see Personal life) just before the band prepared to record their highly anticipated follow-up, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001). Hoppus felt complacent creatively but DeLonge felt otherwise, creating post-hardcore side project Box Car Racer to experiment with ideas he deemed unsuitable for blink.<ref name=shooman92>Shooman, 2010. p. 92</ref>
Hoppus felt betrayed (Barker was also in Box Car Racer) and a rift developed between Hoppus and DeLonge that would carry on into the band's future.<ref name="TomQA2005"></ref> When the band regrouped to record their next record in 2003, all of the members had become fathers (or, in the case of Barker, becoming one) and the trio took a darker, more "mature" direction with their Blink-182 (album),<ref></ref> infusing experimentalist elements into their usual pop punk sound partially inspired by Box Car Racer.<ref name="tonedown"></ref> Unresolved feelings from that project would arise in late 2004 when the band began to argue regarding their future and recording process.<ref name="TomQA2005"/> The February 2005 break-up of blink-182 affected Hoppus greatly: "I had no idea what to do. After blink broke up I had such a loss of identity and purpose. I just had a giant sense of void."<ref name=KerrangSep2011></ref> Hoppus then began to work on even darker, electronic demos with Barker in his kitchen.<ref></ref><ref name="formation"></ref> He also turned to producing, hitting the studio with Motion City Soundtrack to record Commit This to Memory (2005).<ref name="mtv"></ref> In October 2005, Hoppus and Barker purchased a studio together (named Opra Music), where they would bring together a full band to expand upon those electronic demos, creating +44's When Your Heart Stops Beating (2006).<ref name=APCoverStory1></ref>
The record, by all accounts, sold poorly and received mixed reviews in the music press.<ref name="billboard4"></ref> Hoppus and Barker continued touring on the Honda Civic Tour and commenced work on a second +44 album. The August 2008 death of friend and producer Jerry Finn deeply affected Hoppus, who referred to Finn as a lifelong friend and mentor.<ref name="mtv1"></ref> The following month, Barker and collaborator Adam Goldstein (aka DJ AM), were involved in a plane crash that killed four people, leaving Barker and Goldstein the only survivors.<ref name="lattimes"></ref> Hoppus immediately boarded a plane to the burn unit, and DeLonge reconnected with the duo under the tragic circumstances.<ref name="rs"></ref> When the band regrouped in the studio for a day, past acrimony vanished with near immediacy.<ref name=KerrangJune2010></ref> Regarding these experiences, Hoppus wrote, "The events of the past two months supersede everything that happened before. Life is too short."<ref name="mtv2"></ref> In February 2009, the band's official website was updated with a statement: "To put it simply, We're back. We mean, really back. Picking up where we left off and then some. In the studio writing and recording a new album. Preparing to tour the world yet again. Friendships reformed. 17 years deep in our legacy."<ref name="Kaufman"></ref>
===Reuniting and recent events===
The band reconnected musically and emotionally on the reunion tour, but were still "on eggshells" throughout the recording of their comeback album.<ref name="billboard12"/> The recording's delay was due to the way the band chose to work – in bits and pieces, alone and together, in a pair of California studios – in addition to each member's busy schedules.<ref name="mtv15"></ref> The band struggled to record juggling individual priorities; in the case of Hoppus, his new television show Hoppus on Music required him flying to New York once a week.<ref name=APCoverStory></ref> Hoppus moved to London with his family late in the recording process, also complicating matters.<ref name="APCoverStory"/> The band's comeback album, Neighborhoods (2011), debuted high but undersold label expectations, and Blink-182 parted with Interscope Records in 2012, going independent for their next release, the EP Dogs Eating Dogs.<ref name="billboard12"></ref>
The band toured Australia in February 2013 without Barker, who did not attend due to his fear of flying (Brooks Wackerman of Bad Religion filled in for him).<ref></ref><ref></ref> The band toured the United States in September 2013, where they planned to begin writing songs for their seventh studio album. "We're hoping to head into the studio next year and to have the album out in late spring/early summer," Hoppus told Kerrang!.<ref name=KerrangAug13></ref> In the interim, Hoppus began recording songs with frequent engineer and producer Chris Holmes that the duo plan to release by the end of the year. "We probably have seven or eight songs in various stages of completion," Hoppus remarked in August 2013.<ref name="KerrangAug13"/> "I still haven't chosen a name for the project yet; we still have to figure that out. It's like guitar mixed with electronics…. at this point." Hoppus will share lead vocals with Holmes on the tracks.<ref name="KerrangAug13"/> On April 25, 2014, Hoppus announced, via Twitter, the name of the band as Nothing and Nobody. Their first album is expected to be released in the "not-too-distant future".<ref></ref>
In 2015, blink-182 played three shows in California. With the departure of Tom DeLonge from the band, Matt Skiba of Alkaline Trio, filled in. It was the first time Hoppus performed under the name "blink-182" without Tom DeLonge by his side. The shows were on March 18, March 20, and March 22.<ref name="eddieodio"></ref> Hoppus later hired Skiba full-time, and blink-182 have since recorded two albums with him, 2016's California and 2019's Nine.
Hoppus has also performed DJ sets at Emo Nite in Los Angeles on several occasions from 2015 to 2017.<ref name="Rolling Stone"></ref>
In non-musical endeavors, Hoppus launched his own clothing line, Hi My Name is Mark (stylized as "HiMyNameIsMark"), in July 2013.<ref name="KerrangAug13"/>
===Simple Creatures (2019-present)===
On 24 January 2019, Mark announced he was forming a new group with Alex Gaskarth of All Time Low called Simple Creatures. A debut song called "Drug" was released in January,<ref></ref> followed by their first EP, Strange Love, on March 29, 2019.<ref></ref> Their second EP, Everything Opposite, was released on October 11, 2019.<ref></ref>
==Musical style and equipment==
Hoppus primarily writes most of his songs on an acoustic guitar.<ref name="GC"/> Hoppus is self-taught, "and consequently I don't have the best technique," he remarked in 2004.<ref name="smh"/> "I think you would learn how to paint by painting, rather than reading books about painters or painting and I think it's the same with music. You learn by doing and getting influences from other artists."<ref name="smh"/>
Hoppus used three different bass guitars while recording Enema of the State: a Fender Precision Bass, Fender Jazz Bass and a Music Man StingRay.<ref name="GC"/> After primarily recording with the two Fender basses, he merged the two together for the Fender Mark Hoppus Signature Jazz Bass, which debuted in 2000.<ref name="GC"/> "I took a Jazz Bass body because I thought it looked really cool and gives a good tone and then I put a P-Bass neck on it because it's a wider neck and it's easier to play—especially for my style, which isn't so much finger work," he said.<ref name="GC"></ref> As of 2015, Hoppus has switched to customized Fender Jaguar Basses when performing on stage with Blink-182, although he still occasionally uses his original signature model.<ref> urltoken 
For live sound, Hoppus originally plugged his basses into three Ampeg SVT Classic bass heads running into two Ampeg 8x10 SVT bass cabs. Prior to the use of the all-tube SVT Classic heads, Hoppus used two Ampeg SVT-4 Pro heads which only feature a tube preamp.<ref></ref> After the Neighborhoods album release, Hoppus used New Vintage amplifiers and cabinets, specifically the Undertow 300 amplifier and NW 8x10 bass cabinets.<ref></ref> In 2016, he began using Kemper Profiler amps in concert.<ref></ref>
==Non-musical endeavors==
Hoppus and Tom DeLonge co-owned two companies, Atticus and Macbeth Footwear, Hoppus has since sold his share in both companies; as well as loserkids.com.<ref name="Mark Hoppus Interview with b182.com"></ref>

Mark Hoppus worked to help relief efforts in Japan after the devastating earthquake and tsunami Tōhoku. He announced that his group Blink-182, will be auctioning off items to benefit the American Red Cross on EBay. "So sad for what's happening in Japan. Gonna dig in the bins & find some old blink-182 items to auction for the Red Cross" said Mark. The items auctioned off included the original lyrics sheet to the group's hits "The Rock Show" and "Adam's Song", Bad Religion autographed cymbal, hand-painted 1.5 FT tall Bunny, blink-182 tour backstage pass, stickers, postcard/magnets, trading cards, the band's dressing room sign from the 2000 VMAs, and Hoppus orange sweater from the "Dammit" music video.

===HiMyNameIsMark (2005, 2012–present)===
"HiMyNameIsMark" is a podcast that was set up in the wake of the Blink-182 hiatus by Hoppus, and can be found at HiMyNameIsMark.com. Every few weeks he released a show of songs by underground bands, interviews with band members and/or friends, and reminisces about happenings in his life. He is often joined on the show by his friends Chris Holmes (+44's engineer) and James Ingram (+44's assistant engineer). Hoppus has also created various side projects including "Hopp on Popp" where he reviews one of his favorite up and coming artists, some of which have been Matt & Kim, fun., and Japandroids.

==Personal life==
Hoppus married Skye Everly on December 2, 2000. Hoppus met Everly at a rehearsal for the music video of "All the Small Things". According to a 2004 interview, Everly, who was then an MTV talent executive, initially refused to date Hoppus: "Tom DeLonge always used to embarrass me. Any girl he'd talk to, he'd say, 'Hey, you wanna go on a date with Mark?' He asked Skye, my wife, who looked at me and said 'No.' That's how it all started."<ref name="blender"></ref> Two years after marrying Hoppus, Everly gave birth to a son, Jack, in 2002.<ref></ref>
In 2004, Hoppus told Risen that he was a registered Libertarian.<ref name="risen"/> "To me, it means to respect other people and let them do their own thing. The government is there to help people but not control them," he remarked.<ref name="risen"/> A 2000 Rolling Stone profile notes that Hoppus "prays every night".<ref name="halfnakedtruth"/> He elaborated on his religious views in a 2005 interview: "It's amazing to me that anyone can say that one thing is right. . To draw lines over something that none of us on earth could possibly comprehend seems like a waste of time."<ref name="risen"/> Throughout 2016 - 2020, Hoppus was openly vocal about his criticism of the Trump Administration. During the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, Hoppus posted a picture on his Instagram account sporting a Biden-Harris t-shirt.
In 2011, Hoppus and his family relocated to Mayfair,<ref name="DINOSAUR"/> as blink-182 were in the process of completing their sixth album, Neighborhoods.

Hoppus began to dress like frontman Robert Smith, donning eyeliner and "occasionally bright red lipstick" to his high school classes ("This all went over exceedingly well with the faculty and staff in the small desert town where I grew up," Hoppus remarked in 2009).<ref name="altpress09.1"></ref><ref name="mh18"/><ref name="TalesFromBeneathYourMom"></ref> Beginning in his first year, Hoppus gained solace through music of both The Cure and The Smiths.<ref name="halfnakedtruth"/><ref name=mh18></ref> Hoppus played by himself and sang in the band Pier 69, primarily covering songs by The Cure, and recorded a live demo with a group named The Attic Children in 1988, featuring covers of The Cure songs. Hoppus returned to Ridgecrest in 1989, completing high school at Burroughs High School. In his teen years, a friend of Hoppus would steal his mother's car in the middle of the night and pick Hoppus up; the two would sneak out to the desert and burn trees and any objects they could find.<ref name="mh18"/>
After graduating from Burroughs High School in 1990, he began playing in a band called of All Things he formed with two friends, covering songs by Descendents, Social Distortion and Bad Religion, as well as writing original punk numbers.<ref name="mh18"/> The group primarily performed at friend's parties and bonfires, and once played Oasis, the local music venue.<ref name="p8-9"/> Hoppus left Ridgecrest in summer 1992 to attend college and get a job at a local music store in San Diego. Hoppus continued playing gigs with of All Things, returning on weekends. Eventually, Hoppus' manager became suspicious of his weekend activities (Hoppus having told him he worked with mentally disabled children in Ridgecrest) and refused any time off on weekends.<ref name="TalesFromBeneathYourMom"/> His "short lived attempt" at college, studying at California State University, San Marcos, revolved around plans to become an English teacher.<ref name="psst"></ref><ref name="nyrock"/> He recalls he "hated" college and his reasoning behind becoming a teacher involved sights set for Education reform. He dropped out in the early 1990s after "things began to take off with Blink-182" and lived with his mother for many of the early years of the band.<ref name="nyrock"></ref> Hoppus describes his mother as always supportive in his decisions to drop out of college and tour with blink-182; however, he describes his father as "more realistic, . he said, 'Have something to fall back on.'"<ref name="risen"/> "I'm really fortunate that my mom always completely supported me, even to the point that I dropped out of college and lived at her house for five years before our band started to catch on," said Hoppus.<ref name="risen"/>
