Star Control

==Gameplay==
Star Control is a combination of a strategy game and real-time one-on-one ship combat simulator. The ship combat is inspired by the classic game Spacewar!, while the turn-based strategy is inspired by Paul Reiche III's 1983 game Archon.<ref name="HG101SC"></ref>
Players begin the game in one of 15 different scenarios on a rotating star map. The player has up to three actions per turn, which are used to explore new stars and colonize or fortify worlds.<ref name="Weiss2016"/> These colonies provide resources to the player's ships, like currency and crew.<ref name="HG101SC"/> The goal is to move your ships across the galaxy, claim planets along the way, and finally destroy your opponentâ€™s star base.<ref name="Weiss2016"/>
When two rival ships meet on the battlefield, an arcade-style combat sequence begins.<ref name="Weiss2016"></ref> The game offers different ships to pilot, which are deliberately imbalanced in ability. Match-ups between these ships have a major influence over combat.<ref name="HG101SC"/> There are 14 different ships, with unique abilities for each.<ref name="Weiss2016"/> Ships typically have a unique firing attack, as well as some kind of secondary ability. Both actions consume the ship's battery, which recharges automatically (with few exceptions). Ships have a limited amount of crew, representing the total damage a ship can take before being destroyed.<ref name="HG101SC"/> This ties into the strategic meta-game between combat, where the crew can be replenished at colonies.<ref name="HG101SC"/>
During combat, the screen frames the action between the two ships with an overhead view, zooming in as they approach each other. Players try to outgun and outmaneuver each other. There is a planet in the middle of the battlefield, providing a centre of gravity, which players can either crash into, or glide nearby to gain momentum.<ref name="HG101SC"/>
The story framing the gameplay is minimal compared to the sequel, described mostly in the game's scenario introductions. Some background can be found in the manuals about two warring factions. The game can be played by one player against the computer, or two players head to head.<ref name="HG101SC"/>
==Development==
=== Concept and origins ===
Star Control is the first collaboration between Paul Reiche III and Fred Ford.<ref name="DeMaria2018"></ref><ref name="Barton2016"></ref> Reiche had started his career working for Dungeons & Dragons publisher TSR, before developing PC games for Free Fall Associates.<ref name="GDC2015"/> After releasing World Tour Golf, Reiche created an advertising mock-up for what would become Star Control, showing a dreadnaught and some ships fighting. He pitched the game to Electronic Arts, before instead securing an agreement with Accolade as a publisher, thanks to Reiche's former producer taking a job there.<ref name="youtubex"></ref> Meanwhile, Ford had started his career creating games for Japanese personal computers before transitioning to more corporate software development.<ref name="Barton2016" /> After a few years working at graphics companies in Silicon Valley, Ford realized he missed working in the game industry.<ref name="youtubex"/> At this point, Reiche needed a programmer-engineer and Ford was seeking a designer-artist, so their mutual friends set up a gaming night to re-introduce them.<ref name="GDC2015" /> The meeting was hosted at game designer Greg Johnson's house,<ref name="youtubex"/> and one of the friends who encouraged the meeting was fantasy artist Erol Otus.<ref name="SC2team"></ref>
 
Originally called Starcon, the game began as an evolution on concepts that Reiche first created in Archon: The Light and the Dark, as well as Mail Order Monsters.<ref name="Barton2016"/> The vision for the game was science-fiction Archon, where asymmetric combatants fight using different abilities in space.<ref name="GDC2015"></ref> According to Ford, "StarCon is really just Archon with an S-T in front of it", pointing to the one-on-one combat and strategic modes of both games.<ref name="youtubex"/> Star Control would base its combat sequences on the classic game Spacewar!,<ref name="DeMaria2018"/> as well as the core experience of space combat game Star Raiders.<ref></ref> As Ford and Reiche were still building their workflow as a team, the game took on a more limited scope compared to the sequel.<ref name = "GDC2015"/>
=== Design and production ===
Fred Ford's first prototype was a two-player action game where the VUX and Yehat ships blow up asteroids, which led them to build the entire universe around that simple play experience.<ref name="Barton2016"/> The Yehat ship was Ford's crescent-shaped design, and its shield-generator led them to optimize the ship for close combat.<ref name="youtubex"/> They built on the two original ships with many additional ships and character concepts,<ref name="DeMaria2018"/> and playtested them with friends such as Greg Johnson and Robert Leyland.<ref name="youtubex"/> The team preferred to iterate on ship designs rather than plan them, as they discovered different play-styles during testing.<ref name="youtubex"/> The asymmetry between the combatants became essential to the experience. Ford explains, "our ships weren't balanced at all, one on one. but the idea was, your fleet of ships, your selection of ships in total was as strong as someone else's, and then, it came down to which matchup did you find".<ref name="warstories"></ref> Still, the ships were still given some balance by having their energy recharge at different rates.<ref name="youtubex"/> 
Although the story does not factor heavily into the game,<ref name="HG101SC"/> the character concepts were created based on the ship designs.<ref name = "GDC2015"/> The team would begin with paper illustrations, followed by logical abilities for those ships, and a character concept that suited the ship's look-and-feel.<ref name="Barton2016"/> The first ship sketches were based on popular science fiction, such as SpaceWars! or Battlestar Galactica, and slowly evolved into original designs as they discussed why the ships were fighting each other.<ref name="youtubex"/> Paul Reiche III describes their character creation process, "I know it probably sounds weird, but when I design a game like this, I make drawings of the characters and stare at them. I hold little conversations with them. 'What do you guys do?' And they tell me."<ref name="DeMaria2018"/> By the end of this process, they wrote a short summary for each alien, describing their story and personality.<ref name="youtubex"/>
Having designed a larger ship that launches fighters on command, Reiche and Ford decided this would be a dominating race.<ref name = "warstories"/> These antagonists would be called the Ur-Quan, with a motivation to dominate the galaxy to hunt for slaves, and an appearance based on a National Geographic image of a predatory caterpillar dangling over its prey.<ref name="DeMaria2018"/> They decided to organize the characters into nominally "good and bad" factions, each with seven unique races and ships, with the humans on the good side.<ref name="youtubex"/> The cowardly personality of the Spathi were inspired by their backwards-shooting missiles.<ref name = "GDC2015"/> After deciding that the game would need more humanoid characters, they created the Syreen as a powerful and attractive humanoid female race.<ref name="youtubex"/> A more robotic ship inspired an alien race called the Androsynth, whose appearance was imagined as Devo flying a spaceship.<ref name="Barton2016"/> The Shofixti were inspired by concepts in David Brin's The Uplift War. Reiche and Ford asked themselves who might be uplifted by the Yehat, a fierce warrior race, and decided upon the Shofixti as a ferocious super rodent.<ref name = "GDC2015"/> 
=== Porting and technology ===
A technological limitation at the time was the limited number of colors, which required that they create settings for CGA, EGA, and VGA monitors.<ref name="GDC2015" /> A separate team ported a stripped down version of the game to the Commodore 64, Spectrum and Amstrad, which meant reducing the number of ships to 8, not to mention the introduction of new bugs and balance issues.<ref name="retrogamer14"></ref> Additional problems were caused by the number of simultaneous key-presses required for a multiplayer game, which required Ford to code a solution that would work across multiple different computer keyboards.<ref name="GDC2015" />
The game was ultimately ported to the Sega Genesis,<ref name="sega16"/> in a team led by Fred Ford.<ref name="youtubex"/> Because the Genesis port was a cartridge-based game with no battery backup, it lacked the scenario-creator of its PC cousin, but it came pre-loaded with a few additional scenarios not originally in the game.<ref name="EGM22"></ref> Whereas the Star Control initially featured synthesized audio, they discovered the digital MOD file format to help port the music to console, which would later become the core music format for their sequel.<ref name = "GDC2015"/> It took nearly 5 months to convert the code and color palates,<ref name = "EGM22"/> leaving little time to optimize the game under Accolade's tight schedule, leading to slowdown issues.<ref></ref><ref> urltoken Log of the 2007-06-13 IRC session with Toys for Bob: "The same goes for the Genesis version of SC1 where we did a quick port with the intention of optimizing it for speed, but they though (sic) having a 12megabit cartridge was a much better selling point."</ref> Also, the port was not authorized by Sega, which led led to a lawsuit between Accolade and Sega of America.<ref name = "GDC2015"/> Sega v. Accolade became an important legal case, creating a precedent to allow reverse engineering under fair use.<ref name="Reverse Engineering: An Industrial Perspective"></ref><ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"></ref> This led Sega to settle the lawsuit in Accolade's favor, making them a licensed Sega developer.<ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"></ref> Released under Accolade's new "Ballistic" label for high quality games, the game was touted as the first 12-megabit cartridge created for the system.<ref name="sega16"></ref> The box art for the Sega version was adapted from the original PC version, this time re-painted by famed artist Boris Vallejo.<ref name="retrogamer14" />
==Reception==
</ref> When Stardock became the top bidder Atari's Star Control assets, Paul Reiche indicated that he still owned the copyright in the original Star Control games, so Stardock must have purchased the Star Control trademark. Stardock confirmed the split in the Star Control intellectual property.<ref></ref><ref></ref> As Stardock began developing their new Star Control game, they re-iterated that they did not acquire the copyright to the first two games, and that they would need a license from Reiche and Ford to use their content and lore.<ref name=":6"></ref> Reiche and Ford echoed this understanding in their 2015 Game Developer Conference interview, stating that Stardock's game would use the Star Control trademark only.<ref name="GDC2015" />
