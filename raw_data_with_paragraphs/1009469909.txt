== Views ==
In books such as The Myth of the Aryan Invasion of India and In Search of the Cradle of Civilization, Frawley criticizes the 19th century racial interpretations of Indian prehistory, such as the theory of a conflict between invading Aryan race and Dravidians.<ref name=autogenerated1>Arvidsson 2006:298 Arvidsson, Stefan (2006), Aryan Idols: Indo-European Mythology as Ideology and Science, translated by Sonia Wichmann, Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press.</ref> In the book In Search of the Cradle of Civilization (1995), Frawley along with Georg Feuerstein and Subhash Kak has rejected the Indo-Aryan migration and supported the Indigenous Aryans theory.
He often publishes in pro-Hindutva vernacular newspapers in the UK<ref></ref> and is a strong advocate of the Hindu Holocaust hypothesis.
Frawley rejects the Indo-Aryan migration in favor of the Indigenous Aryans theory; accusing his opponents of having a “European missionary bias”.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Martha Nussbaum and others consider him to be the most determined opponent in this regard.<ref></ref><ref name=":0" /> In The Myth of the Aryan Invasion of India, Frawley has criticized the 19th-century racial interpretations of Indian prehistory and rejects the theory of a conflict between invading Aryan race and Dravidians.<ref name=autogenerated1 />
In the sphere of market-economics, Frawley opposes socialism, stating that such policies have reduced citizens to beggars.<ref name=":5"></ref>
==Reception==
Frawley has been well-received by both in the western yoga community and the Indian community.<ref name=":1" /> Edwin Bryant notes that a Westerner rejecting the Aryan Migration Theory has an obvious appeal in India and Frawley (along with Koenraad Elst) fits in it, perfectly.<ref></ref> Thus, despite being rejected by academia, he has been much more successful in the popular market and his works are clearly directed and articulated at such audiences.<ref name=":2"></ref><ref name=":6" /><ref name=":7" />
=== Yoga and Ayurveda Community ===
Frawley was mentioned among the three important teachers or acharyas of the Vedic tradition in the West today, along with Georg Feuerstein and Andrew Harvey in the famous book American Veda: How Indian Spirituality Changed the West.<ref></ref> Dr. Frawley has been mentioned as “one of the first Americans to bring Ayurvedic Medicine and Vedic Astrology to the West” by the prominent magazine Yoga Journal<ref></ref> and other prominent yoga publications.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
Prominent author and spiritualist Deepak Chopra mentioned Dr. Frawley as one of the main Yoga teachers of his and David Simon and referred Frawley as an authentic spiritual guru for any serious seeker of higher divine consciousness.<ref></ref>
Rajiv Mehrotra (2003) of the Foundation for Universal Responsibility of His Holiness the Dalai Lama in New Delhi, India, interviewed Frawley as one of twenty important spiritual teachers in his book The Mind of the Guru.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Frawley's Swami Vivekananda: The Maker of a New Era in Global Spirituality occurs in a Ramakrishna Mission book anthology, published in honor of the one hundred and fiftieth birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.<ref></ref>
Prabuddha Bharata (2014), a publication of the Ramakrishna Order, reviewed Mantra Yoga and Primal Sound as "a revelation in terms of the astonishing width of literature".<ref></ref> Guy Beck glowingly praised In Search of the Cradle of Civilization in a review for the Yoga Journal.<ref name="beck96"></ref> Frawley has a significant following on Twitter, as well.<ref name=":6" />
=== Critical reception ===
He has been described as a prominent figure of the Hindutva movement<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref name=":3" /><ref></ref><ref></ref> and numerous scholars have also described him as a Hindutva ideologue and apologist.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref name=":5" /> He has been widely accused of practicing historical revisionism.<ref></ref><ref name=":7" />
Meera Nanda asserts that Frawley is a member of the Hindu far right, who decries Islam and Christianity as religions for the lower intellects<ref></ref> and whose works feature a Hindu Supremacist spin.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Sudeshna Guha of Cambridge University notes him to be a sectarian non-scholar and as a proponent of a broader scheme for establishing a nationalist history.<ref></ref> Irfan Habib rejected considering Frawley as a scholar, and instead, noted him to be a Hindutva pamphleteer, who "telescoped the past to serve the present" and was not minimally suitable of being defined as a scholar, of any kind.<ref></ref><ref name=":6" /> Bryant notes him to be an unambiguously pro-Hindu scholar.<ref name=":2" /> Peter Heehs deems of him to be part of a group of reactionary orientalists, who professed an avid dislike for the Oriental-Marxist school of historiography and hence, chose to rewrite the history of India but without any training in relevant disciplines; he also accused Frawley of misappropriating Aurobindo's nuanced stance on the Indigenous Aryans hypothesis.<ref name=":4"></ref>
Bruce Lincoln attributes Frawley's ideas to "parochial nationalism", terming them "exercises in scholarship (= myth + footnotes)", where archaeological data spanning several millennia is selectively invoked, with no textual sources to control the inquiry, in support of the theorists' desired narrative.<ref></ref> His proposed equivalence of Ayurveda with vedic healing traditions has been rejected by other Indologists and David Hardiman considers Frawley's assertion to be part of a wider Hindu-nationalist quest.<ref></ref> Joseph Alter notes that his writings 'play into the politics of nationalism' and remarks of them to be controversial from an academic locus.<ref></ref>
==== Book reviews ====
In a review of Hymns from the Golden Age: Selected Hymns from the Rig Veda with Yogic Interpretation for the Journal of the American Oriental Society, Richard G. Salomon heavily criticized Frawley's fanciful approach that was in complete contrast to the available linguistic and scholarly evidence and perpetuated Vedic myths in what seemed to be a bid to attract readers for the recreation of the ancient spiritual kingdom of the Aryans.<ref></ref>
A review by M. K. Dhavalikar in Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute called In Search of the Cradle of Civilization a "beautifully printed" contribution that made a strong case for their indigenous theory against the supposed migratory hypotheses but chose to remain silent on certain crucial aspects which need to be convincingly explained.<ref name="dhavalikar96"></ref> Prema Kurien noted that the book sought to distinguish expatriate Hindu Americans from other minority groups by demonstrating their superior racial and cultural ties with the Europeans.<ref></ref>
Dhavalikar also reviewed The Myth of the Aryan Invasion of India and found it to be unsupported by archaeological evidence.<ref name=":0"></ref> Irfan Habib criticized the premises of his invoking the Sarasvati River in the book, as an assault against common sense and deemed that all claims built upon its greatness ought be treated as castles in the air.<ref></ref>
== Influences ==
Referring to his book Yoga and Ayurveda, Frawley is mentioned as one of the main yoga teachers of Deepak Chopra and David Simon in their book, the Seven Spiritual Laws of Yoga (2005).<ref></ref> In 2015, Chopra said of Frawley's book, Shiva, the Lord of Yoga, "Vamadeva Shastri has been a spiritual guide and mentor of mine for several decades. For anyone who is serious about the journey to higher divine consciousness, this book is yet another jewel from him."<ref></ref>
== Honors ==
In 2015, the South Indian Education Society (SIES) in Mumbai, India, an affiliate of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham, conferred upon him their special "National Eminence Award" as an “international expert in the fields of Ayurveda, Yoga, and Vedic Astrology.”<ref></ref>
