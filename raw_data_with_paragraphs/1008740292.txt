Thracians

==Etymology==
The first historical record of the Thracians is found in the Iliad, where they are described as allies of the Troy in the Trojan War against the Ancient Greeks.<ref></ref> The ethnonym Thracian comes from Ancient Greek Θρᾷξ (plural Θρᾷκες; , or Θρᾴκιος ; Ionic: Θρηίκιος, , and the toponym Thrace comes from Θρᾴκη ; Ionic: Θρῄκη, .<ref> urltoken Navicula Bacchi – Θρηικίη (Accessed: October 13, 2008).</ref> These forms are all exonyms as applied by the Greeks.<ref>John Boardman, I.E.S. Edwards, E. Sollberger, and N.G.L. Hammond. The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC. Cambridge University Press, 1992, p. 597. "We have no way of knowing what the Thracians called themselves and if indeed they had a common name. Thus the name of Thracians and that of their country were given by the Greeks to a group of Hellenic tribes occupying the territory."</ref>
==Mythological foundation==
In Greek mythology, Thrax (by his name simply the quintessential Thracian) was regarded as one of the reputed sons of the god Ares.<ref>Lemprière and Wright, p. 358. "Mars was father of Cupid, Anteros, and Harmonia, by the goddess Venus. He had Ascalaphus and Ialmenus by Astyoche; Alcippe by Agraulos; Molus, Pylus, Euenus, and oThestius, by Demonice the daughter of Agenor. Besides these, he was the reputed father of Romulus, Oenomaus, Bythis, Thrax, Diomedes of Thrace, &c."</ref> In the Alcestis, Euripides mentions that one of the names of Ares himself was "Thrax" since he was regarded as the patron of Thrace (his golden or gilded shield was kept in his temple at Bistonia in Thrace).<ref>Euripides, p. 95. "Line 58. 'Thrace's golden shield' – One of the names of Ares was Thrax, he being the Patron of Thrace. His golden or gilded shield was kept in his temple at Bistonia there. Like the other Thracian bucklers, it was of the shape of a half-moon ('Pelta'). His 'festival of Mars Gradivus' was kept annually by the Latins in the month of March, when this sort of shield was displayed."</ref>
==Origins==
The origins of the Thracians remain obscure, in the absence of written historical records. Evidence of proto-Thracians in the prehistoric period depends on artifacts of material culture. Leo Klejn identifies proto-Thracians with the multi-cordoned ware culture that was pushed away from Ukraine by the advancing timber grave culture or Srubnaya. It is generally proposed that a proto-Thracian people developed from a mixture of Neolithic Europe and Indo-Europeans from the time of Proto-Indo-European expansion in the Early Bronze Age<ref>Hoddinott, p. 27.</ref> when the latter, around 1500 BC, mixed with indigenous peoples.<ref>Casson, p. 3.</ref> During the Iron Age (about 1000 BC) Dacians and Thracians began developing from proto-Thracians.<ref>John Boardman, I.E.S. Edwards, E. Sollberger, and N.G.L. Hammond. The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 1: The Prehistory of the Balkans, the Middle East and the Aegean World, Tenth to Eighth Centuries BC. Cambridge University Press, 1982, p. 53. "Yet we cannot identify the Thracians at that remote period, because we do not know for certain whether the Thracian and Illyrian tribes had separated by then. It is safer to speak of Proto-Thracians from whom there developed in the Iron Age."</ref>
Ancient Greek and Roman historians agreed that the ancient Thracians, who were of Indo-European stock and language, were superior fighters; only their constant political fragmentation prevented them from overrunning the lands around the northeastern Mediterranean. Although these historians characterized the Thracians as primitive partly because they lived in simple, open villages, the Thracians in fact had a fairly advanced culture that was especially noted for its poetry and music. Their soldiers were valued as mercenaries, particularly by the Macedonians and Romans.
==Identity and distribution==
Divided into separate tribes, the Thracians did not manage to form a lasting political organization until the Odrysian was founded in the fifth century BC. A strong Dacian state appeared in the first century BC, during the reign of King Burebista. The mountainous regions were home to various peoples, including the Illyrians, regarded as warlike and ferocious Thracian tribes, while the plains peoples were apparently regarded as more peaceable.
Thracians inhabited parts of the ancient provinces of Thrace, Moesia, Macedonia, Beotia, Attica, Dacia, Scythia Minor, Sarmatia, Bithynia, Mysia, Pannonia, and other regions of the Balkans and Anatolia. This area extended over most of the Balkans region, and the Getae north of the Danube as far as beyond the Bug and including Pannonia in the west.<ref>The catalogue of Kimbell Art Museum's 1998 exhibition Ancient Gold: The Wealth of the Thracians indicates a historical extent of Thracian settlement including most of the Ukraine, all of Hungary and parts of Slovakia.

There were about 200 Thracian tribes.<ref>Mircea Eliade, Ioan Petru Culianu, Humanitas, Bucuresti, 1993, p.267. </ref>

=== Homeric period ===
The Thracians are mentioned in Homer's Illyiad, meaning that they had been already present in the eigth century BC.<ref>Homer. The Iliad with an English Translation by A.T.

===Archaic period===
The first Greek colonies in Thrace were founded in the eighth century BC.<ref>Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth. The Oxford Classical Dictionary. Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 1515. "From the 8th century BC the coast Thrace was colonised by Greeks."</ref>
Thrace south of the Danube (except for the land of the Bessi) was ruled for nearly half a century by the Persians under Darius the Great, who conducted an expedition into the region from 513 to 512 BC. The Persians called Thrace "Skudra".<ref>Susan Wise Bauer. The History of the Ancient World: From the Earliest Accounts to the Fall of Rome. W.W. Norton & Company, 2007, p. 517.

The Thracians ; Thrāikes; were an Indo-European people who inhabited large parts of Eastern and Southeast Europe in ancient history.<ref name="Webber_Definition">. "The Thracians were an Indo-European people who occupied the area between northern Greece, southern Russia, and north-western Turkey. They shared the same language and culture. There may have been as many as a million Thracians, diveded among up to 40 tribes."</ref><ref>. "One of the best documented Indo-European civilizations that inhabited Bulgaria is the Thracians."</ref> Thracians resided mainly in the Balkans, but were also located in Asia Minor and other locations in Eastern Europe. 
The exact origin of Thracians is unknown, but it is believed that proto-Thracians descended from a mixture of Indo-Europeans and Neolithic Europe during the second millennium BC. The proto-Thracian culture developed into the Dacian and Thracian culture.
Thracian culture was described as Tribe by the Ancient Greece and Romans. They remained largely disunited with the first permanent state being the Odrysian kingdom in the fifth century BC. They faced subjugation by the Achaemenid Empire around the same time. Thracians experienced a short period of peace after the Persians were defeated by the Greeks in the Persian Wars. The Odrysian kingdom lost independence to Macedonia in the late 4th century BC, and never regained total independence following Alexander the Great's death.
The Thracians faced conquest by the Romans in the mid second century BC under whom they faced internal strife. They composed major parts of rebellions against the Romans along with the Macedonians until the Third Macedonian War. Thracians were integrated into Roman society and later converted to Christianity. The last reported use of a Thracian language was by monks in the sixth century AD.
Thracians were described as "warlike" and "barbarians" by the Greeks and Romans and were favored as mercenaries. Ancient descriptions of a vicious people are disputed and archaeology has been used since the mid-twentieth century in southern Bulgaria to identify more about them.
Thracians spoke the extinct Thracian language and shared a common culture.<ref name="Webber_Definition" /> They followed a Polytheism with the exception of the Monotheism Dacians who worshipped Zalmoxis. The study of the Thracians is known as Thracology.
