Robert Sedgewick (computer scientist)

== Early life ==
Sedgewick was born on December 20, 1946 in Willimantic, Connecticut. During his childhood he lived in Storrs, Connecticut, where his parents Charles Hill Wallace Sedgewick and Rose Whelan Sedgewick were professors at the University of Connecticut.<ref> urltoken Pioneering Women in American Mathematics: The Pre-1940 PhD's</ref>
In 1958, he moved with his parents to Wheaton, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C., where he attended Wheaton High School, graduating in 1964.
== Education ==
Sedgewick earned his Bachelor of Science (1968) and Master of Science (1969) degrees in Applied Mathematics from Brown University, where he was a student of Andries van Dam. He went on to graduate work at Stanford University where he was an advisee of Donald E. Knuth, receiving his Ph.D. in 1975.<ref> urltoken Robert Sedgewick at the urltoken Mathematics Genealogy Project</ref> His thesis was entitled Quicksort and was named an outstanding dissertation in computer science.<ref> urltoken Outstanding dissertations in computer science, vol 18 (Garland)</ref>
== Work and academic career ==
Sedgewick returned to Brown to start his academic career as an assistant professor in 1975, with promotion to associate professor in 1980 and full professor in 1983. At Brown, he participated in the founding of the computer science department, in 1979.<ref> urltoken A Brief History of the CS Department (Brown University)</ref>
In 1985, Sedgewick joined the faculty at Princeton University as founding chair of the Department of Computer Science<ref> urltoken Computer Science building opens (Princeton Weekly Bulletin)</ref> where he is now the William O. Baker *39 Professor of Computer Science.<ref> urltoken 30 years of Computer Science at Princeton</ref> The first-year courses in computer science that he developed at Princeton are among the most popular courses ever offered at the university.<ref> urltoken The New 'Rithmetic: Computer Science (US1 Princeton)</ref> He also pioneered the practice of replacing large live lectures with on-demand online videos.<ref> urltoken Computer Science for All, Really (Princeton CS Department)</ref>
Throughout his career, he has worked at research institutions outside of academia during summers and sabbatical leaves:
*The Communications Research Division of the Institute for Defense Analyses in Princeton, New Jersey, an opportunity to work with the CRAY-1 supercomputer.
*Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), an opportunity to see the personal computer come into existence.
*The Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique (INRIA) in France, a long and fruitful collaboration with Philippe Flajolet.
== Research ==
Sedgewick developed red-black trees (with Leonidas J. Guibas),<ref>A Dichromatic Framework for Balanced Trees. 19th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 1980.</ref> ternary search trees (with Jon Bentley),<ref>Ternary Search Trees.

Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 2011, .</ref> are replete with novel implementations of classic algorithms and scientific studies comparing them, in Pascal (programming language), C (programming language), C++, Modula-3, and Java (programming language) (See Bibliography). He is known for emphasizing a scientific approach to the analysis of algorithms, based on validating mathematical models with experimental work using realistic data.<ref> urltoken Putting the "Science" back into Computer Science</ref> With Philippe Flajolet, he developed the field of mathematics known as analytic combinatorics.
He has organized research meetings and conferences on data structures, algorithm science, and analytic combinatorics around the world, including Dagstuhl seminars on analysis of algorithms and data structures,<ref> urltoken Schloss Dagstuhl</ref> annual International Meetings on Probabilistic, Combinatorial, and Asymptotic Methods in the Analysis of Algorithms (AofA)<ref> urltoken Analysis of Algorithms</ref> and SIAM Meetings on Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO).<ref> urltoken ANALCO</ref>
== Publishing ==
Sedgewick is the author of twenty books. He is best known for Algorithms,<ref>Algorithms, 4th edition. Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 2011, .</ref> originally published in 1983 and now in its fourth edition. His 2008 book with Philippe Flajolet, Analytic Combinatorics,<ref>Analytic Combinatorics.
