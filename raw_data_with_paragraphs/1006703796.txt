;The Business School
Faculties organised undergraduate and postgraduate schemes within a university modular framework. An interdisciplinary undergraduate scheme for inter-faculty combined honours degrees was managed centrally by the Academic Registry.
===Learning Centre===
In 1994, the Learning Centre library opened on the site of a former mirror factory. In 1996, the Trades Union Congress library collections, which had been established in 1922, were transferred there. It is the major research library for the study of all aspects of trade unions, collective bargaining and labour history, with both historical and contemporary coverage.<ref> urltoken Trades Union Congress Library Collections London Metropolitan University (retrieved 1 March 2010)</ref>
===The Rocket===
The Great Hall was officially opened by the Lord Mayor of London in 1897, as a social and academic events space catering for dances and recitals. By 1929, a proscenium arch and stage were installed and it was renamed the Theatre, playing host to operas and theatrical productions. Throughout the 1980s, it was a solid fixture on the capitals gig circuit and an essential stop for touring bands. When electronic dance music and the club scene took hold at the turn of the decade, it was relaunched as the Rocket complex and became one of London's leading all-nighter venues.
The 1990s also saw the building divided vertically, creating its two separate floors. In 2015, the Great Hall had its name and grandeur restored, with the Rocket now referring exclusively to the ground floor bar and adjacent courtyard garden.
===Vice-chancellors===
The vice-chancellor and chief executive was supported by the deputy vice-chancellor (academic) and the deputy vice-chancellor (research and development).
In 2000, the university awarded an honorary degree to The Most Reverend Desmond Tutu, Archbishop of Cape Town and primate of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa, in a special ceremony.
Following the merger with London Guildhall (formerly the City of London Polytechnic), London Metropolitan became the largest unitary university in London.

===Northern Polytechnic Institute===
The Northern Polytechnic opened in Holloway with aid from the City Parochial Foundation and substantial donations from the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers in 1896. Under the terms of its Royal Charter, its objective was "to promote the industrial skill, general knowledge, health and well-being of young men and women belonging to the poorer classes of Islington and to provide for the inhabitants of Islington and the neighbouring parts of north London, and especially for the Industrial Classes, the means of acquiring a sound General, Scientific, Technical and Commercial Education at small cost."<ref>Roderick Floud and Glynn, Sean (eds.) urltoken London Higher: The Establishment of Higher Education in London (pp. 204 and 212) London: The Athlone Press, 1998</ref>
The founding Principal of the Institute was the chemist Dr JT Dunn. He appointed VA Mundella as its first Professor of Physics and Head of the Department of Physics and Electrical Engineering.
By 1911, five-year University of London evening degrees were available. The modernist Cecil Stephenson was appointed Head of Art in 1923 and, from 1925, courses were recognised by the Royal Institute of British Architects.

The Polytechnic later acquired premises at St. Pancras, Highbury (Ladbroke House) and Nos. 207–225 Essex Road.

The Polytechnic of North London was founded by the 1971 merger of the Northern and North-Western polytechnics. Its first Director was Terence Miller, former principal of the University of Rhodesia.<ref> urltoken Shotgun Marriage: A Profile of the North London Polytechnic Education + Training Vol. 13, No. 5 (pp. 150–152) May 1971</ref> Until the passing of the Education Reform Act 1988, it came under the control of the Inner London Education Authority, part of the then Greater London Council. Degree awarding authority resided with the former Council for National Academic Awards until the polytechnic, a pioneer of widening participation and access to higher education, was granted university status under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992.
After leaving Oxford in 1964, the renowned historian A. J. P. Taylor lectured at the Polytechnic until his death in 1990.<ref>Hughes-Warrington, Marnie urltoken Fifty Key Thinkers on History (p. 305) London: Routledge, 2000</ref>
====The Harrington affair====
In 1984, Patrick Harrington, a prominent member of the National Front and deputy editor of NF News, was the subject of protests by fellow students who picketed and boycotted his lectures, arguing that his presence made life intolerable for ethnic minority students.<ref>Kirkwood, Richard urltoken "Changing Audiences, Changing Contexts – Reflections on 37 years with students looking at ‘Race’ issues" in Farrar, Max and Todd, Malcolm (eds.)

The University of North London (UNL) was a university in London, England, formed from the Polytechnic of North London (PNL) in 1992 when that institution was granted university status. PNL, in turn, had been formed by the amalgamation of the Northern Polytechnic and North-Western Polytechnic in 1971. In 1996, the university celebrated its centenary, dating from the year of the Northern Polytechnic's founding. UNL existed until 2002, when it merged with London Guildhall University to form London Metropolitan University. Its former premises now form the University's north campus, on Holloway Road and Highbury Grove, Islington.
