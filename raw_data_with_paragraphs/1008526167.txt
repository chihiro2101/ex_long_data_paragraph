Open theism

==Exposition of open theism==
In short, open theism says that since God and humans are free, God's knowledge is dynamic and God's providence flexible. While several versions of traditional theism picture God's knowledge of the future as a singular, fixed trajectory, open theism sees it as a plurality of branching possibilities, with some possibilities becoming settled as time moves forward.<ref name="Peterson2007"></ref><ref name="Peterson2006"></ref> Thus, the future as well as God's knowledge of it is open (hence "open" theism). Other versions of classical theism hold that God fully determines the future, entailing that there is no free choice (the future is closed). Yet other versions of classical theism hold that even though there is freedom of choice, God's omniscience necessitates God foreknowing what free choices are made (God's foreknowledge is closed). Open theists hold that these versions of classical theism do not agree with:
# the biblical concept of God
# the biblical understanding of divine and creaturely freedom
and/or result in incoherence. Open Theists tend to emphasize that God's most fundamental character trait is love, and that this trait is unchangeable. They also (in contrast to traditional theism) tend to hold that the biblical portrait is of a God deeply moved by creation, experiencing a variety of feelings in response to it.<ref></ref>
===Comparison of open and Reformed theism===
The following chart compares beliefs about key doctrines as stated by open theists and Calvinism after "the period of controversy" between adherents of the two theisms began in 1994.<ref>WRS Journal 12:1 (Feb 2005), 5.</ref> During this period the "theology of open theism… rocked the evangelical world".<ref>WRS Journal 12:1 (Feb 2005), Editor's notes, inside cover.</ref>

Open theism, also known as openness theology and free will theism,<ref></ref> is a theological movement that has developed within Christianity as a rejection to the synthesis of Greek philosophy and Christian theology. Open theism is typically advanced as a biblically motivated and philosophically consistent theology of human and divine freedom (in the libertarian sense), with an emphasis on what this means for the content of God's foreknowledge and exercise of God's power.<ref name="reknew.org"></ref>
Noted Open Theist theologian Thomas Jay Oord identifies four paths to open and relational theology:<ref></ref>
# following the biblical witness,
# following themes in some Christian theological traditions,
# following the philosophy of free will, and
# following the path of reconciling faith and science.
Roger E. Olson said that open theism triggered the "most significant controversy about the doctrine of God in evangelical thought" in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.<ref></ref>
