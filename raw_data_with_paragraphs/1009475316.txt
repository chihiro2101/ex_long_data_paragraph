Aguirre, the Wrath of God

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film was produced in part by West German television station Hessischer Rundfunk, which televised the film on the same day it opened in theatres. Herzog has blamed this for the relatively poor commercial reception of the film in Germany.<ref name="Herzog1" /> However, outside Germany the film became an "enormous cult favorite" in "such places as Mexico, Venezuela, and Algiers."<ref name="Peary">Danny Peary. Cult Movies, Delta Books, 1981. </ref> The film had a theatrical run of fifteen months in Paris.<ref name="Young">Young, Vernon. "Much Madness: Werner Herzog and Contemporary German Cinema", in The Hudson Review, Vol. 30, No. 3 (August 1977), pp. 409–414.</ref> Aguirre received a theatrical release in the United States in 1977 by New Yorker Films. It immediately became a cult film, and New Yorker Films reported four years after its initial release that it was the only film in its catalog that never went out of circulation.<ref name="Peary"/>
In Germany, the Süddeutsche Zeitung described the film as "a colour-drenched, violently physical moving painting".<ref name=Baumgardt></ref> The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung described Kinski's acting as "too theatrical" to embody God's wrath.<ref name="Baumgardt" />
In the US and the UK the film received mostly positive critical notices upon release. Vincent Canby, writing in The New York Times, called it "Absolutely stunning&nbsp;. Mr. Herzog views all the proceedings with fixed detachment. He remains cool. He takes no sides. He may even be slightly amused. Mainly he is a poet who constantly surprises us with unexpected juxtapositions . This is a splendid and haunting work."<ref></ref> In Time, Richard Schickel opined that "Herzog does the audience the honor of allowing it to discover the blindnesses and obsessions, the sober lunacies he quietly lays out on the screen. Well acted, most notably by Klaus Kinski in the title role, gloriously photographed by Thomas Mauch, Aguirre is, not to put too fine a point on it, a movie that makes a convincing claim to greatness."<ref></ref> Time Out's Tony Rayns noted, ".each scene and each detail is honed down to its salient features. On this level, the film effectively pre-empts analysis by analysing itself as it proceeds, admitting no ambiguity. Yet at the same time, Herzog's flair for charged explosive imagery has never had freer rein, and the film is rich in oneiric moments."<ref></ref>
===Legacy===
The film's reputation through the years has continued to grow. J. Hoberman has written that Aguirre "is not just a great movie but an essential one . Herzog's third feature . is both a landmark film and a magnificent social metaphor."<ref name="Hoberman"></ref> Danny Peary wrote, "To see Aguirre for the first time is to discover a genuine masterpiece. It is overwhelming, spellbinding; at first dreamlike, and then hallucinatory."<ref name="Peary" /> Roger Ebert has added it to his list of The Great Movies,<ref></ref> and in a 2002 Sight & Sound poll of critics and filmmakers on the best films ever made, Ebert listed it in his top ten.<ref></ref> In the same poll, critic Nigel Andrews and director Santosh Sivan also placed it in their top ten list.<ref></ref> In 1999, Rolling Stone included the film on the magazine's "100 Maverick Movies of the Last 100 Years" list.<ref></ref> Aguirre was included in Time Magazines "All Time 100 Best Films", compiled by Richard Schickel and Richard Corliss.<ref></ref> Entertainment Weekly named it the 46th greatest cult film ever made.<ref> urltoken "The Top Cult Movies", Entertainment Weekly.</ref> The film was ranked #19 in Empire magazine's "The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema" in 2010.<ref></ref>
Aguirre has won several prestigious film awards. In 1973 it won the Deutscher Filmpreis (German Film Award) for "Outstanding Individual Achievement: Cinematography".<ref></ref> In 1976 it was voted the "Best Foreign Film" by the French Syndicate of Film Critics.<ref></ref><ref></ref> In 1977 the National Society of Film Critics US gave it their "Best Cinematography" Award.<ref></ref> It won the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association in 1976 and was nominated for a "Best Film" César Award.<ref></ref>
===Influence===
Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 film Apocalypse Now, a film based on Joseph Conrad's 1902 novella Heart of Darkness, was influenced also by Aguirre, as it contains seemingly deliberate visual "quotations" of Herzog's film.<ref name="Rubin"></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> Coppola himself has noted, "Aguirre, with its incredible imagery, was a very strong influence. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it."<ref></ref>
Several critics have noted that Aguirre appears to have had a direct influence on several other films. Martin Rubin has written that "among the films strongly influenced by Aguirre are Coppola's Apocalypse Now and Terrence Malick's The New World (2005)".<ref name="Rubin" /> J. Hoberman agreed, noting that Herzog's "sui generis Amazon fever dream" was "the influence Malick's over-inflated New World can't shake."<ref name="Hoberman" /> Channel 4 opined "This is an astonishing, deceptively simple, pocket-sized epic whose influence, in terms of both style and narrative, is seen in films as diverse as Apocalypse Now, The Mission, Predator, and The Blair Witch Project (1999)."<ref></ref>
==Historical accuracy==
Although plot details and many of the characters in Aguirre come directly from Herzog's own imagination, historians have pointed out that the film fairly accurately incorporates some 16th-century events and historical personages into a fictional narrative. 
Herzog's screenplay merged two expeditions: one led by Gonzalo Pizarro in 1541, which resulted in the discovery by Europeans of the Amazon river by Francisco de Orellana, and another one that occurred in 1560.
The expedition of Gonzalo Pizarro and his men left from the city of Quito and entered the Amazon basin in search of El Dorado. Various troubles afflicted the expedition and, sure that El Dorado was very close, Pizarro set up a smaller group led by Francisco de Orellana to break off from the main group and forge ahead, then return with news of what they had found. This group utilized a brigantine to journey down the river. After failing to find the legendary city, Orellana was unable to return because of the current, and he and his men continued to follow the Napo River until he reached the estuary of the Amazon in 1542.
Accompanying Orellana was Gaspar de Carvajal, who kept a journal of the group's experiences.
The historic Gaspar de Carvajal (1500–1584) was a Spanish Dominican friar who had settled in Peru and dedicated himself to the conversion of the Indigenous peoples. His general attitude towards the local people was consistent with the benevolence of his better-known brother Dominican friar, Bartolomé de las Casas. This personality is at odds with the description in the film where Carvajal is portrayed as a cowardly priest who claimed that "the church was always on the side of the strong." <ref name="Fritze" />
The film's major characters, Aguirre, Ursúa, Don Fernando, Inez and Flores, were involved in the second expedition, which left Peru in 1560 to find the city of El Dorado. Commissioned by Peru's governor, Ursúa organized an expeditionary group of 300 men to travel by way of the Amazon River. He was accompanied by his Mestizo mistress, Doña Inez. At one point during the journey, Aguirre, a professional soldier, decided that he could use the 300 men to overthrow the Spanish rule of Peru. Aguirre had Ursúa murdered and proclaimed Fernando as "The Prince of Peru". Fernando himself was eventually murdered when he questioned Aguirre's scheme of sailing to the Atlantic, conquering Panama, crossing the isthmus and invading Peru. Many others who attempted to rebel against Aguirre were also killed. The surviving soldiers conquered Isla Margarita off the coast of Venezuela and made preparations to attack the mainland. However, by that time Spanish authorities had learned of Aguirre's plans, and when the rebels arrived in Venezuela, government agents offered full pardons to Aguirre's men. All of them accepted the deal. Immediately prior to his arrest, Aguirre murdered his daughter Flores, who had remained by his side during the entire journey. He was then captured and dismembered.<ref name="Waller">Waller, Gregory. "Aguirre, The Wrath of God: History, Theater, and the Camera", from South Atlantic Review 46.2 (1981), pgs. 55 – 69.</ref>
Other Spanish expeditions outside the Amazon influenced the story; the conversation in which the local inhabitants refuse a Bible comes from events before the Battle of Cajamarca, in which Inca emperor Atahualpa allegedly rejected the Requerimiento. The chronicle of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, La Relación ("The Account"), mentions the appearance of a boat in a treetop after a fierce tropical storm in Hispaniola:
Kinski's crazed performance bore similarities to the real Aguirre, a "true homicidal megalomaniac". Many of his fellow soldiers considered his actions to be that of a madman.<ref name="Fritze" /> Kinski's use of a limp reflected one that Aguirre had, the result of a battle injury. Aguirre's frequent short but impassioned speeches to his men in the film were accurately based on the man's noted "simple but effective rhetorical ability."<ref name="Waller"/>

Herzog explained how the choir-like sound was created, "We used a strange instrument, which we called a 'Mellotron.' It has inside it three dozen different tapes running parallel to each other in loops. . All these tapes are running at the same time, and there is a keyboard on which you can play them like an organ so that it will sound just like a human choir but yet, at the same time, very artificial and really quite eerie."<ref name="Ebert" />
In 1975 Popol Vuh released an album entitled Aguirre. Although ostensibly a soundtrack album to Herzog's film, the six-track LP included only two songs ("Aguirre I (L'Acrime Di Rei)" and "Aguirre II") taken from Aguirre, the Wrath of God. The four remaining tracks were derived from various recordings made by the group between about 1972 and 1974. At the time of Aguirre the band members were Fricke (piano, Mellotron), Fichelscher (electric guitar, acoustic guitar, drums), Djong Yun (vocals), and Robert Eliscu (oboe, pan pipe).
