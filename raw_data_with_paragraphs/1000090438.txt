Roger Cotes

==Early life==
Cotes was born in Burbage, Leicestershire. His parents were Robert, the rector of Burbage, and his wife, Grace, née Farmer. Roger had an elder brother, Anthony (born 1681), and a younger sister, Susanna (born 1683), both of whom died young. At first Roger attended Leicester School, where his mathematical talent was recognised. His aunt Hannah had married Rev. John Smith, and Smith took on the role of tutor to encourage Roger's talent. The Smiths' son, Robert Smith, would become a close associate of Roger Cotes throughout his life. Cotes later studied at St Paul's School in London and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1699.<ref></ref> He graduated BA in 1702 and MA in 1706.<ref name="ODNB">Meli (2004)</ref>
==Astronomy==
Roger Cotes's contributions to modern computational methods lie heavily in the fields of astronomy and mathematics. Cotes began his educational career with a focus on astronomy. He became a fellow of Trinity College in 1707, and at age 26 he became the first Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy. On his appointment to professor, he opened a subscription list in an effort to provide an observatory for Trinity. Unfortunately, the observatory still was unfinished when Cotes died, and was demolished in 1797.<ref name="ODNB"/>
In correspondence with Isaac Newton, Cotes designed a heliostat telescope with a mirror revolving by clockwork.<ref>Edleston, J., ed. (1850) Correspondence of Sir Isaac Newton and Professor Cotes, … (London, England: John W. Parker), urltoken "Letter XCVIII. Cotes to John Smith." (1708 February 10), pp. 197–200.</ref><ref></ref> He recomputed the solar and planetary tables of Giovanni Domenico Cassini and John Flamsteed, and he intended to create tables of the moon's motion, based on Newtonian principles. Finally, in 1707 he formed a school of physical sciences at Trinity in partnership with William Whiston.<ref name="ODNB"/>
==The Principia==
From 1709 to 1713, Cotes became heavily involved with the second edition of Newton's Principia, a book that explained Newton's theory of universal gravitation. The first edition of Principia had only a few copies printed and was in need of revision to include Newton's works and principles of lunar and planetary theory.<ref name="ODNB"/> Newton at first had a casual approach to the revision, since he had all but given up scientific work. However, through the vigorous passion displayed by Cotes, Newton's scientific hunger was once again reignited. The two spent nearly three and half years collaborating on the work, in which they fully deduce, from Newton's laws of motion, the theory of the moon, the equinoxes, and the orbits of comets. Only 750 copies of the second edition were printed.<ref name="ODNB"/> However, a pirate copy from Amsterdam met all other demand. As reward to Cotes, he was given a share of the profits and 12 copies of his own. Cotes's original contribution to the work was a preface which supported the scientific superiority of Newton's principles over the then popular vortex theory of gravity advocated by René Descartes. Cotes concluded that the Newton's law of gravitation was confirmed by observation of celestial phenomena that were inconsistent with the vortex phenomena that Cartesian critics alleged.<ref name="ODNB"/>
==Mathematics==
Cotes's major original work was in mathematics, especially in the fields of integral calculus, logarithms, and numerical analysis. He published only one scientific paper in his lifetime, titled Logometria, in which he successfully constructs the logarithmic spiral.<ref name="mactutor">O'Connor & Robertson (2005)</ref><ref>In Logometria, Cotes evaluated e (mathematical constant), to 12 decimal places. See: Roger Cotes (1714) "Logometria," Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 29 (338) : 5-45; urltoken see especially the bottom of page 10. From page 10: "Porro eadem ratio est inter 2,718281828459 &c et 1, … " (Furthermore, the same ratio is between 2.718281828459… and 1, … )</ref> After his death, many of Cotes's mathematical papers were hastily edited by his cousin Robert Smith and published in a book, Harmonia mensurarum.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref>Harmonia mensurarum contains a chapter of comments on Cotes' work by Robert Smith. On page 95, Smith gives the value of 1 radian for the first time. See: Roger Cotes with Robert Smith, ed., Harmonia mensurarum … (Cambridge, England: 1722), chapter: Editoris notæ ad Harmoniam mensurarum, urltoken top of page 95. From page 95: After stating that 180° corresponds to a length of π (3.14159…) along a unit circle (i.e., π radians), Smith writes: "Unde Modulus Canonis Trigonometrici prodibit 57.2957795130 &c. " (Whence the conversion factor of trigonometric measure, 57.2957795130… degrees per radian, will appear.)</ref> Cotes's additional works were later published in Thomas Simpson's The Doctrine and Application of Fluxions.<ref name="mactutor"/> Although Cotes's style was somewhat obscure, his systematic approach to integral and mathematical theory was highly regarded by his peers. Cotes discovered an important theorem on the n-th root of unity,<ref>Roger Cotes with Robert Smith, ed., Harmonia mensurarum … (Cambridge, England: 1722), chapter: "Theoremata tum logometrica tum triogonometrica datarum fluxionum fluentes exhibentia, per methodum mensurarum ulterius extensam" (Theorems, some logorithmic, some trigonometric, which yield the fluents of given fluxions by the method of measures further developed), urltoken pages 113-114.</ref> foresaw the method of least squares,<ref>Roger Cotes with Robert Smith, ed., Harmonia mensurarum … (Cambridge, England: 1722), chapter: "Aestimatio errorum in mixta mathesis per variationes partium trianguli plani et sphaerici" Harmonia mensurarum . , pages 1-22, see especially urltoken page 22. From page 22: "Sit p locus Objecti alicujus ex Observatione prima definitus, … ejus loco tutissime haberi potest." (Let p be the location of some object defined by observation, q, r, s, the locations of the same object from subsequent observations. Let there also be weights P, Q, R, S reciprocally proportional to the displacements that may arise from the errors in the single observations, and that are given from the given limits of error; and the weights P, Q, R, S are conceived as being placed at p, q, r, s, and their center of gravity Z is found: I say the point Z is the most probable location of the object, and may be most safely had for its true place. Ronald Gowing, 1983, p. 107)</ref> and discovered a method for integrating rational fractions with binomial denominators.<ref name="mactutor"/><ref>Cotes presented his method in a letter to William Jones, dated May 5, 1716. An excerpt from the letter which discusses the method was published in: Anon. (1722), Book review: "An account of a book, intitled, Harmonia Mensurarum, … ," Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 32 : 139-150 ; see urltoken pages 146-148.</ref> He was also praised for his efforts in numerical methods, especially in interpolation methods and his table construction techniques.<ref name="mactutor"/> He was regarded as one of the few British mathematicians capable of following the powerful work of Sir Isaac Newton.
==Death and assessment==
Cotes died from a violent fever in Cambridge in 1716 at the early age of 33. Isaac Newton remarked, "If he had lived we would have known something."<ref name="ODNB"/>
