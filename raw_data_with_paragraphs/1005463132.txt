Elias Disney

==Early life==
Disney was born in the rural village of Bluevale, in what is now Ontario, Canada, to Irish Protestant immigrants Kepple Elias Disney (1832–1891) and Mary Richardson (1838–1909). Both parents had emigrated from Ireland to Canada as children, accompanying their parents.<ref name="Barrier3">Barrier (2007), p. 12</ref>
Disney was an ardent socialist and a supporter of Eugene Debs.<ref>Schlosser. Fast Food Nation. p. 36</ref><ref name="Barrier4">Barrier (2007), p. 13</ref> He became a farmer and a businessman with little success. He moved to California with his father in 1878 in hopes of finding gold. Instead, Kepple was convinced by an agent of the Union Pacific Railroad to buy of land near Ellis, Kansas. In Ellis, Disney attempted to live as an orange grower and failed.<ref name="Barrier3"/>
==Career==

Disney worked on his father's new farm until 1884, when he left to find another job. He was hired in a railroad machine shop (one of his co-workers was Walter Chrysler), then he joined the railroad crew building the Union Pacific line through Colorado. After the railroad contract was over, he became a professional fiddle player in Denver. Again he was unsuccessful, and he returned to his father's farm. He also worked for a short time as a mailman in Kissimmee, Florida, close to the eventual site of Walt Disney World. Disney did also attempt to make a career as an orange grower in Florida, but he was unsuccessful.<ref></ref> Although frequently unsuccessful at self-employment, Disney's entrepreneurial tendencies were passed on to his son Walt.
He was a construction worker for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, an event which author Erik Larson cites as a source of inspiration for his son Walt and the Disney kingdom he would eventually create.<ref></ref> He bought shares of O-Zell Company, a jelly-canning factory that also produced apple juice in Chicago, where his son Walt Disney worked before he joined the Red Cross Ambulance Corps in World War I.<ref></ref>
By 1890, the Disneys lived at 3515 South Vernon Avenue in the Fourth Ward. Disney worked as a carpenter.<ref name="Barrier">Barrier (2007), p. 9-10</ref> On October 31, 1891, Disney bought a lot at 1249 Tripp.<ref></ref> By 1892, he had built a house on it. The neighborhood was called Hermosa and had been settled by Scottish, German, and Scandinavian immigrants. Their younger three children were born there.<ref name="Barrier"/><ref> urltoken 
By the turn of the century, Disney had become an active building contractor. He built houses which he owned and then resold. He also built the Saint Paul Congregational Church, a building dedicated on October 14, 1900. Disney was one of the church's trustees, while his wife was its treasurer.<ref name="Barrier4"/>
According to some sources, Disney worried about the rising criminality of the city. A neighboring family had two adolescent children involved in a car barn robbery, and Disney feared that crime would taint his own children.<ref name="Barrier"/> In 1906 he moved with his family to a farm near Marceline, Missouri. Disney and his family settled there in April, 1906. On March 5, he bought a farm. Its previous owner William E. Crane had died in November, 1905. Crane was a veteran of the American Civil War and his house predated the foundation of Marceline.<ref name="Barrier"/> He bought the farm for $3,000 or $75 per acre. On April 3, Disney bought an adjoining tract of about from Crane's widow. He paid an additional $450.<ref name="Barrier"/>
Marceline was probably chosen for being accessible from Chicago, for its rural setting, and because his younger brother Robert owned a farm west of the city.<ref name="Barrier"/> The Crane Farm had orchards of apples, peaches, and plums, and fields of grain. The farm animals included pigs, chickens, horses, and cows.<ref name="Barrier2">Barrier (2007), p. 11</ref> The Disneys had a telephone connection by 1907.<ref name="Barrier2"/> Herbert and Raymond Disney never liked life on the farm. They moved out around the fall of 1908, heading back to Chicago. They found work as clerks.<ref name="Barrier5">Barrier (2007), p. 14</ref>
In 1907, Disney convinced some of his fellow farmers to join the American Society of Equity, a farmer's union aiming to consolidate the members' buying power.<ref name="Barrier7">Barrier (2007), p. 16-17</ref>
The family sold the farm on November 28, 1910, as Disney fell ill. He was suffering from typhoid fever, followed by pneumonia.<ref name="Barrier7"/> The Disneys lived in a rented house in Marceline, probably at 508 North Kansas Avenue. Until 1911, when they moved to Kansas City, Missouri. They lived in a rented house at 2706 East Thirty-first Street. They stayed there until they bought their own modest home in September, 1914. It was situated at 3028 Bellefontaine Street.<ref name="Barrier7"/><ref name="dnr.mo.gov"></ref>
On July 1, 1911, Disney purchased a newspaper delivery route for The Kansas City Star. It extended from the Twenty-seventh Street to the Thirty-first Street, and from Prospect Avenue to Indiana Avenue. Roy and Walt were put to work delivering the newspapers. The Disneys delivered the morning newspaper Kansas City Times to about 700 customers and the evening and Sunday Star to more than 600. Their customers increased with time.<ref name="Barrier8">Barrier (2007), p. 18</ref> Disney also delivered butter and eggs to his newspaper customers. They were imported from a dairy farm in Marceline.<ref name="Barrier9">Barrier (2007), pp. 19-20</ref>
Disney sold the paper route on March 17, 1917. He had been investing in the O-Zell Company of Chicago since 1912 and moved back to the city in 1917 to take an active role in its management.<ref name="Barrier9"/> The Disneys rented a flat at 1523 Ogden Avenue.<ref name="Barrier10">Barrier (2007), p. 21</ref>
He retired from management work in 1920 and moved back to Kansas City. He was again listed as a carpenter.<ref name="Barrier11">Barrier (2007), p. 27-28</ref> He moved to Portland, Oregon by the fall (autumn September–October) of 1921. His son Herbert had earlier moved to this city.<ref name="Barrier12">Barrier (2007), pp. 29-30</ref>
