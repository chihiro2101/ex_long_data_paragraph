What would Jesus do?

==History==
===Theological background===
The Roman Catholic Church emphasizes the concept of Imitatio Christi (imitation of Christ), which is summarized well in the English phrase "What Would Jesus Do?"<ref></ref>
John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Church, in 1766 postulated the concept of Christian perfection, a moment in the life of a Christian at which the regeneration effectuated by the Holy Spirit results in a "perfection in love" which means that at least at that moment one is being motivated wholly by Great Commandment, with no taint of sin or ulterior motives in effect. While such Christian perfection is expressed in outward action, it is also the effect of grace. Indeed, Wesley could speak of sanctification by faith as an analogous doctrine to the more widely held belief in justification by faith. Because Christian perfection is also visible in outward good works and a rigorously moral lifestyle, adherents of the Holiness movement assumed that a perfectly moral lifestyle is a consequence (not the cause) of the state of grace and ultimate salvation.
===Earlier appearances of the term, 1420s–1891===
Charles Spurgeon, a well-known evangelical Baptist preacher in London, used the phrase "what would Jesus do" in quotation marks several times in a sermon he gave on June 28, 1891.<ref>Sermon no. 2210. Spurgeon.org </ref> In his sermon he cites the source of the phrase as a book written in Latin by Thomas à Kempis between 1418 and 1427, Imitatio Christi (The Imitation of Christ).
The Rev. A.B. Simpson, founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church, wrote both the lyrics and music of a Gospel Hymn "What Would Jesus Do" with a copyright date of 1891. It can be found at #669 in Hymns of the Christian Life.<ref>Hymns of the Christian Life (1908) Christian Alliance Publishing New York.</ref>
===1896 novel===
Charles Sheldon's 1896 book In His Steps was subtitled "What Would Jesus Do?"<ref name=BBCnews/><ref>Sheldon, C. (1896). urltoken In His Steps . First published by the Chicago Advance in serial form.</ref> Sheldon's novel grew out of a series of sermons he delivered in his Congregationalist church in Topeka, Kansas. Unlike the previous nuances mentioned above, Sheldon's theology was shaped by a commitment to Christian Socialism. The ethos of Sheldon's approach to the Christian life was expressed in this phrase "What Would Jesus Do", with Jesus being a moral example as well as a Saviour figure.<ref> urltoken Charles Monroe Sheldon/Central Congregational Church Collection, 1811-1984.</ref> Sheldon's ideas coalesced with those that formed into the Social Gospel espoused by Walter Rauschenbusch. Indeed, Rauschenbusch acknowledged that his Social Gospel owed its inspiration directly to Sheldon's novel,<ref name="FloridaCara"></ref> and Sheldon himself identified his own theology with the Social Gospel.<ref name=FloridaCara/>
Due to a mistake by the original publisher, the copyright for Sheldon's novel was never established and multiple publishers were able to print and sell the novel. This caused the novel to be easily affordable and it sold 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the top 50 bestselling novels ever.<ref name=BBCnews/>
In this popular novel (it had been translated into 21 languages by 1935), Rev. Henry Maxwell encounters a homeless man who challenges him to take seriously the imitation of Jesus. The homeless man has difficulty understanding why, in his view, so many Christians ignore the poor:
<blockquote><poem>I heard some people singing at a church prayer meeting the other night,
"All for Jesus, all for Jesus,
All my being's ransomed powers,
All my thoughts, and all my doings,
All my days, and all my hours."
and I kept wondering as I sat on the steps outside just what they meant by it. It seems to me there's an awful lot of trouble in the world that somehow wouldn't exist if all the people who sing such songs went and lived them out. I suppose I don't understand. But what would Jesus do? Is that what you mean by following His steps? It seems to me sometimes as if the people in the big churches had good clothes and nice houses to live in, and money to spend for luxuries, and could go away on summer vacations and all that, while the people outside the churches, thousands of them, I mean, die in tenements, and walk the streets for jobs, and never have a piano or a picture in the house, and grow up in misery and drunkenness and sin."<ref>Sheldon, C. (1896) In His Steps, p. 10</ref></poem></blockquote>
This leads to many of the novel's characters asking, "What would Jesus do?" when faced with decisions of some importance. This has the effect of making the characters embrace Christianity more seriously and to focus on what they see as its core &mdash; the life of Christ.
In 1993, Garrett W. Sheldon (great-grandson of the original author) and Deborah Morris published What Would Jesus Do? : a contemporary retelling of Charles M. Sheldon's classic In His Steps. Garrett Sheldon states that his updated version "is based on many actual events in the lives of believers."<ref>Garrett W. Sheldon with Deborah Morris, What Would Jesus Do? : a contemporary retelling of Charles M. Sheldon's classic In His Steps (1993), p. iv.</ref>
It is possible that Sheldon was familiar with either Spurgeon or Thomas, or that he was independently inspired.
===1990s===
A youth group leader at Calvary Reformed Church<ref></ref> in Holland, Michigan, named Janie Tinklenberg, began a grassroots movement to help the teenagers in her group remember the phrase; it spread worldwide in the 1990s among Christian youth, who wore bracelets bearing the initials WWJD.<ref name=BBCnews/><ref> urltoken Salon.com Business | What would Jesus do - about copyright? </ref><ref> urltoken What Would Jesus Do? - by Sandy Sheppard .</ref> Later, a sequel bracelet was generated with the initials "FROG," to provide an answer to "WWJD." FROG was an acronym for "Fully Rely On God."<ref></ref>
===2000s===
In 2005, Garry Wills wrote "What Jesus Meant", in which he examined "What Would Jesus Really Do" (also a book review in Esquire Magazine).
===2010===
In April 2010 a film, WWJD, starring Adam Gregory and based on In His Steps by Charles Sheldon, was released on DVD.<ref></ref>
On 31 March 2015 a sequel film was released WWJD What Would Jesus Do? The Journey Continues.<ref></ref> The second film using the moniker WWJD II was The Woodcarver which was released in 2012. It has a similar theme but different characters.<ref></ref>
==Parodies==
The expression has become a snowclone, sometimes for humorous effect. For example, What Would Jesus Buy?, "What Would Lincoln Do?", "What Would Brian Boitano Do?", "What Would Mary Marvel Do?", "What Would Johnny Cash Do?", and "What would Tintin do?".<ref>A small book investigating Tintin as a role model for young people. urltoken 
==Management and leadership==
The term "What Would Jesus Do?" or "WWJD" is also perceived as a fundamental management and leadership principle given Jesus' methodology of going to the marketplace to preach and lead by example. In modern management principles, more academic and professional references are going to the gemba or Management by Walking Around.<ref></ref>

The phrase "What would Jesus do?", often abbreviated to WWJD, became popular particularly in the United States in the late 1800s after the widely read book by Charles Sheldon entitled, “In His Steps: What Would Jesus Do.” The phrase had a resurgence in the US and elsewhere in the 1990s and as a personal motto for adherents of Christianity who used the phrase as a reminder of their belief in a moral imperative to act in a manner that would demonstrate the love of Jesus through the actions of the adherents.<ref name="BBCnews"></ref><ref name="HelmekeSori2012"></ref>
In popular consciousness, the acronym signifying the question—WWJD—is associated with a type of bracelet or wristband which became a popular accessory for members of Christian youth groups, both Catholic and Protestant, in the 1990s.<ref name=BBCnews/><ref name="HelmekeSori2012"/><ref></ref>
