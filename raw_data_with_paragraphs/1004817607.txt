Panic of 1873

==United States==
===Factors===
The American Civil War (1861-1865) was followed by a boom in railroad construction. of new track were laid across the country between 1868 and 1873, <ref>Richardson (2007) p. 131</ref> with much of the craze in railroad investment being driven by government land grants and subsidies to the railroads.<ref>White (2011) p. 17</ref> The railroad industry was the largest employer outside agriculture in the US and involved large amounts of money and risk. A large infusion of cash from speculators caused spectacular growth in the industry and in the construction of docks, factories, and ancillary facilities. Most capital was involved in projects offering no immediate or early returns.<ref>Oberholtzer, A History of the United States Since the Civil War (1926) 3:79–122</ref>
===Coinage Act of 1873===
A period of economic overexpansion arose from the northern railroad boom before a series of economic setbacks: the Black Friday (1869), the Great Chicago Fire, an outbreak of equine influenza and the Boston fire of 1872, and the Coinage Act of 1873.
The decision of the German Empire to cease minting silver thaler coins in 1871 caused a drop in demand and downward pressure on the value of silver, which, in turn, affected the US since much of the supply of silver was mined there. As a result, the US Congress passed the Coinage Act of 1873, which changed the national silver policy. 
Before the Act, the US had backed its currency with both gold and silver and minted both types of coins. The Act moved the United States to a de facto gold standard, which meant it would no longer buy silver at a statutory price or Free Silver, but it would still mint silver dollars for export in the form of trade dollars.<ref>Unger (1964) ch 8</ref>
The Act had the immediate effect of depressing silver prices, hurting Western mining interests, who labeled the Act "The Crime of '73", but its effect was offset somewhat by the introduction of a silver trade dollar for use in Asia and the discovery of new silver deposits at Virginia City, Nevada, that resulted in new investment in mining activity.<ref>Loomis (1968), pp. 219–220, 224–225.</ref> The Act also reduced the domestic money supply, raising interest rates and hurting farmers and others who normally carried heavy debt loads. The resulting outcry raised serious questions about how long the new policy would last.<ref>Silver coinage was resumed under the Bland–Allison Act of 1878.</ref> The perception of US instability in its monetary policy caused investors to shy away from long-term obligations, particularly long-term bonds. The problem was compounded by the railroad boom, which was then in its later stages.
In September 1873, the US economy entered a crisis.
====Jay Cooke & Company fails====
In September 1873, Jay Cooke & Company, a major component of the country's banking establishment, found itself unable to market several million dollars in Northern Pacific Railway bonds. Jay Cooke's firm, like many others, had invested heavily in the railroads. Some investment banks were then anxious for more capital for their enterprises, US President Ulysses S. Grant's monetary policy of contracting the money supply and thus raising interest rates made matters worse for those in debt. Businesses were expanding, but the money they needed to finance that growth was becoming scarcer.
Cooke and other entrepreneurs had planned to build the second transcontinental railroad, the Northern Pacific Railway. Cooke's firm provided the financing, and ground for the line was broken near Duluth, Minnesota, on 15 February 1870. The railroad had borrowed more than $1.5 million from Cooke & Co but were incapable of paying it back.<ref name=":0"></ref> 1875–1890 became "the golden years" of Giovanni de Ciotta in Rijeka.
===Britain===
The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 was one of the causes of the Panic of 1873 because goods from the Far East had been carried in sailing vessels around the Cape of Good Hope and were stored in British warehouses. As sailing vessels were not adaptable for use through the Suez Canal (because the prevailing winds of the Mediterranean Sea blow from west to east), the British entrepôt trade suffered.<ref>The economic development of the American nation, p. 356, Reginald Charles McGrane, Ginn & Co., Boston 1950.</ref>
When the crisis came, the Bank of England raised interest rates to 9 percent. Despite this, Britain did not experience the scale of financial mayhem seen in America and Central Europe, perhaps forestalled by an expectation that the liquidity-constraining provisions of the Bank Charter Act of 1844 would be suspended as they had been in the crises of 1847, 1857, and 1866. The ensuing economic downturn in Britain seems to have been muted – "stagnant" but without a "decline in aggregate output".<ref>Glasner (1997), pp. 132–133</ref> However there was heavy unemployment in the basic industries of coal, iron and steel, engineering, and shipbuilding, especially in 1873, 1886, and 1893.<ref>Alfred E. Musson, "The great depression in Britain, 1873–1896: a reappraisal." Journal of Economic History 19.2 (1959): 199-228, at p. 202.</ref>
====Comparison with Germany====
From 1873 to 1896, a period sometimes referred to as the Long Depression, most European countries experienced a drastic fall in prices. Still, many corporations were able to reduce production costs and achieve better productivity rates with industrial production increasing by 40% in Britain and by over 100% in Germany. A comparison of capital formation rates in both countries helps to account for the different industrial growth rates. During the depression, the British ratio of net national capital formation to net national product fell from 11.5% to 6.0%, but the German ratio rose from 10.6% to 15.9%. During the depression, Britain took the course of static supply adjustment, but Germany stimulated effective demand and expanded industrial supply capacity by increasing and adjusting capital formation. For example, Germany dramatically increased investment of social overhead capital, such as in the management of electric power transmission lines, roads, and railroads, thereby stimulating industrial demand in that country, but similar investment stagnated or decreased in Britain. The resulting difference in capital formation accounts for the divergent levels of industrial production in the two countries and the different growth rates during and after the depression.<ref></ref>
===India===
The discovery of large quantities of silver in the United States and several European colonies caused the panic of 1873 and thus a decline in the value of silver relative to gold, devaluing India's standard currency. This event was known as "Indian rupee#1800s".
===South Africa===
In the Cape Colony, the panic caused bankruptcies, rising unemployment, a pause in public works, and a major trade slump that lasted until the discovery of gold in 1886.<ref>Keith Tankard, "The Effects of the 'great depression' of the Late 19th Century on East London 1873-1887." South African Journal of Economic History (1991) 6#2 pp 72-88. </ref>
===Ottoman Empire===
In the periphery, the Ottoman Empire's economy also suffered. Rates of growth of foreign trade dropped, external terms of trade deteriorated, declining wheat prices affected peasant producers, and the establishment of European control over Ottoman finances led to large debt payments abroad. The growth rates of agricultural and aggregate production were also lower during the Long Depression than the later period.<ref></ref>
===Latin Monetary Union===
The general demonetization and cheapening of silver caused the Latin Monetary Union in 1873 to suspend the conversion of silver to coins.
==Global protectionism==
After the 1873 depression, agricultural and industrial groups lobbied for protective tariffs. The 1879 tariffs protected these interests, stimulated economic revival through state intervention, and refurbished political support for the conservative politicians Otto von Bismarck in Germany and John A. Macdonald in Canada. Bismarck gradually veered away from classical liberal economic policies in the 1870s, embracing many economic interventionism policies, including high tariffs, nationalization of railroads, and compulsory social insurance.<ref>Eyck (1950), pp. 223–236, 252–261.</ref><ref>Masur (1970), pp. 75–80.</ref><ref>Richter (1962), pp. 219–220, 255–256.</ref> The political and economic nationalism also reduced the fortunes of the German and Canadian classical liberal parties. France, like Britain, also entered into a prolonged stagnation that extended to 1897. The French also attempted to deal with their economic problems by the implementation of tariffs. New French laws in 1880 and in 1892 imposed stiff tariffs on many agricultural and industrial imports.<ref></ref> The U.S., still in the period after the Civil War, continued to be very protectionist.<ref>Marc-William Palen, " urltoken Foreign Relations in the Gilded Age: A British Free-Trade Conspiracy?"

The Panic of 1873 was a financial crisis that triggered an economic depression in Europe and North America that lasted from 1873 to 1877 or 1879 in France and in Britain. In Britain, the Panic started two decades of stagnation known as the "Long Depression" that weakened the country's economic leadership.<ref>Musson (1959)</ref> In the United States, the Panic was known as the "Great Depression" until the Great Depression set a new standard.<ref></ref>
The Panic of 1873 and the subsequent depression had several underlying causes for which economic history debate the relative importance. American inflation, rampant speculation (overwhelmingly in railroads), the demonetization of silver in Germany and the United States, ripples from economic dislocation in Europe resulting from the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), and major property losses in the Great Chicago Fire (1871) and the Great Boston Fire (1872) helped to place massive strain on bank reserves, which, in New York City, plummeted from $50 million to $17 million between September and October 1873.
The first symptoms of the crisis were financial failures in Vienna, the capital of Austria-Hungary, which spread to most of Europe and to North America by 1873.
