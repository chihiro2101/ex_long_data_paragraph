VxWorks

==History==
VxWorks started in the late 1980s as a set of enhancements to a simple RTOS called VRTX<ref name="netrino-glossary-v"></ref> sold by Ready Systems (becoming a Mentor Graphics product in 1995).<ref></ref> Wind River acquired rights to distribute VRTX and significantly enhanced it by adding, among other things, a file system and an integrated development environment. In 1987, anticipating the termination of its reseller contract by Ready Systems, Wind River developed its own kernel to replace VRTX within VxWorks.<ref> urltoken Lord of the Toasters, Wired (magazine) interview with Jerry Fiddler, September 1998</ref>
VxWorks key milestones are:<ref name="history"> urltoken Company Histories, Funding Universe</ref>
* 1980s: VxWorks adds support for 32-bit processors.
* 1990s: VxWorks 5 becomes the first RTOS with a networking stack.
* 2000s: VxWorks 6 supports SMP and adds derivative industry-specific platforms.
* 2010s: VxWorks adds support for 64-bit processing<ref name="star"/> and introduces VxWorks 7 for IoT in 2016.<ref name="joab2">Wind River urltoken Outfits VxWorks for the Internet of Things, Computer World</ref>
==Platform overview==
VxWorks supports Intel architecture, Power architecture, and ARM architectures.<ref name="HW"/> The RTOS can be used in multi-core asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP), symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), and mixed modes<ref name="star"/> and multi-OS (via Type 1 hypervisor)<ref name="virt"/> designs on 32- and 64-bit processors.
The VxWorks consists of a set of runtime components and development tools. The run time components are an operating system (UP and SMP; 32- and 64-bit), software for applications support (file system, core network stack, USB stack and inter-process communications) and hardware support (architecture adapter, processor support library, device driver library and board support packages).<ref name="star"/> VxWorks core development tools are compilers such as Diab, GNU, and Intel C++ Compiler (ICC)) and its build and configuration tools. The system also includes productivity tools such as its Workbench development suite and Intel tools and development support tools for asset tracking and host support.<ref name="star"/>
The platform is a modular, vendor-neutral, open system that supports a range of third-party software and hardware. The OS kernel is separate from middleware, applications and other packages,<ref name="msscwb"/> which enables easier bug fixes and testing of new features.<ref name="joab2"/> An implementation of a layered source build system allows multiple versions of any stack to be installed at the same time so developers can select which version of any feature set should go into the VxWorks kernel libraries.
Optional advanced technology for VxWorks provides add-on technology-related capabilities, such as:
* Advanced security features to safeguard devices and data residing in and traveling across the Internet of Things (IoT)
* Advanced safety partitioning to enable reliable application consolidation
* Real-time advanced visual edge analytics allowing autonomous responses on VxWorks-based devices in real time without latency
* Optimized embedded Java runtime engine enabling the deployment of Java applications
* Virtualization capability with a real-time embedded, Type 1 hypervisor

==Hardware support==
VxWorks has been ported to a number of platforms and now runs on practically any modern CPU that is used in the embedded market. This includes the Intel x86 family (including the Intel Quark SoC),<ref name="quark">Intel Tackles SoC With urltoken Quark"' EE Times, October 7, 2013</ref> MIPS, PowerPC (and BAE RAD), Freescale ColdFire, Intel i960, SPARC, FR-V, SH-4 and the closely related family of ARM, StrongARM and xScale CPUs.<ref name="HW"/> VxWorks provides a standard board support package (BSP) interface between all its supported hardware and the OS. Wind River's BSP developer kit provides a common application programming interface (API) and a stable environment for real-time operating system development. VxWorks is supported by popular SSL/TLS libraries such as wolfSSL.<ref></ref> 
==Development environment==
As is common in embedded system development, cross compiler is used with VxWorks. Development is done on a "host" system where an integrated development environment (IDE), including the editor, compiler toolchain, debugger, and emulator can be used. Software is then compiled to run on the "target" system. This allows the developer to work with powerful development tools while targeting more limited hardware. VxWorks uses the following host environments and target hardware architectures:<ref name="HW"/><ref name="ide"> urltoken Workbench Product Note</ref>
;Supported target architectures and processor families
VxWorks supports the following target architectures:
* ARM
* Intel architecture

== TCP vulnerability and CVE patches ==
As of July 2019, a paper published by Armis<ref></ref> exposed 11 critical vulnerabilities, including remote code execution, denial of service, information leaks, and logical flaws impacting more than two billion devices using the VxWorks RTOS.<ref></ref> The findings are significant since this system is in use by quite a few mission-critical products. This urltoken YouTube video from Armis<ref></ref> shows how an attacker can tunnel into an internal network using the vulnerability and hack into printers, laptops, and any other connected devices. The vulnerability can bypass firewalls as well.<ref></ref>
Information and patches for all VxWorks versions affected by Urgent/11 vulnerability can be obtained from Wind River.<ref></ref>
== Stale Data Retention ==
The Wind River VxWorks operating system is used on the Boeing 787-8, 787-9 and 787-10 aircraft. As of April 2, 2020, the US Federal Aviation Administration requires the operating system to be power-cycled, or turned off and on, every fifty-one (51) days.<ref></ref> The reason for requiring the periodic reboot of the common core system (CCS) is that its failure when continuously powered could lead to a loss of the common data network (CDN) message age validation, which filters out stale data from key flight control displays. From the FAA Air Directive: "The potential loss of the stale-data monitoring function of the CCS when continuously powered on for 51 days, if not addressed, could result in erroneous flight-critical data being routed and displayed as valid data, which could reduce the ability of the flight crew to maintain the safe flight and landing of the airplane."
