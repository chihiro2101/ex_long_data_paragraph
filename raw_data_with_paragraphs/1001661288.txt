Thuringian Forest

== Natural regions ==
=== Northwest Thuringian Forest ===
The Northwest Thuringian Forest comprises an area of about 70&nbsp;km² reaching heights up to , hardly exceeding those of the adjacent Buntsandstein forelands to the southwest, but exhibiting a much more pronounced relief. It stretches until Moosbach stream, a tributary or Erbstrom river, in the north east, and to Bundesstraße 19 in the east and south, which follows the upper reaches of Elte river between the villages of Wilhelmsthal and Etterwinden. The predominant rock species is Eisenacher Rotliegend, namely conglomerates and sandstones. The area is known for the so-called Drachenschlucht, a narrow gorge near Eisenach, and the Wartburg castle. The northern part of the area is drained by several streams into the Hörsel, the southern part into the Elte. Hence, the ridge of the Northwestern Thuringian Forest only forms the watershed between Hörsel and the middle course of the Werra.
Notable summits include:
* Großer Drachenstein (470 m)
* Wartberg (about 390 m, north of the main ridge), site of Wartburg castle
The much larger natural region of Central Thuringian Forest with an area of about 850&nbsp;km², whose ridge rises mostly above , is subdivided into several parts described below in their sequence from the north-west to the south-east.
=== Ruhla Thuringian Forest ===
This part, situated around the town of Ruhla north of the Rennsteig, is geologically formed by the basement rocks of the Ruhlaer Kristallin, consisting of granites, gneiss, and schist. There is no pronounced ridge, summits on both sides of the watershed reach heights of or more. Its northeastern parts drain towards the Hörsel, the southwestern parts towards the middle course of the Werra. The area is limited towards the south-east by state road 1027 between Schwarzhausen and Bad Liebenstein.
Notable summits include:
* Birkenheide (717 m, immediately south of Rennsteig)
* Glöckner (702 m)
* Windsberg (671 m), foothill of Birkenheide and site of Altenstein castle
* Ringberg (639 m) with Alexanderturm (observation tower)
=== Brotterode Thuringian Forest ===
Reaching until Tambach-Dietharz, the part of Thuringian forest around the town of Brotterode is geologically more heterogeneous than the region around Ruhla. State road 1026 between Friedrichroda and Floh-Seligenthal which follows the valleys of the rivers Schilfwasser and Schmalkalde and passes through Kleinschmalkalden and state road 1028 between Georgenthal and Floh-Seligenthal which follows the valleys of the rivers Apfelstädt and Flohbach divide the area into segments. In this area the mountain ridge becomes more pronounced. The summit of Großer Inselsberg of volcanic origin causes a marked shift of the ridge towards the north. South of Georgenthal, the mountain range becomes the watershed between Elbe and Weser.
Notable summits include:
* Großer Inselsberg (916.5 m) between Brotterode and Tabarz, popular tourist destination
* Großer Weißenberg (747 m), location of a tripoint between the former countries of Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and Kurhessen and of today's districts Gotha, Schmalkalden-Meiningen, and Wartburgkreis.
* Gerberstein (728 m) with an outlook platform
=== Tambach-Oberhof Thuringian Forest ===
The B 247 from Luisenthal via Oberhof and Zella-Mehlis to Suhl, which follows the Ohra to the north, a section along the Lichtenau to the south and finally the lower reaches of the Mühlwasser, together with the slightly more than 10&nbsp;km long L 1028 road that runs parallel to it to the northwest separates this natural sub-division of the Thuringian Forest from the rest. Apart from the south, this region is traversed by very few public roads and is only populated in the south – in the villages of Schnellbach and Struth-Helmershof in the municipality of Floh-Seligenthal, the Rotterode, Unterschönau and Oberschönau suburbs of Steinbach-Hallenberg and the town of Zella-Mehlis.
The Elbe-Weser watershed, accompanied by the Rennsteig, reaches heights of around 900&nbsp;m at several places southwest to west of Oberhof, but does not really form any individual mountains and has very much the character of a mountain crest. By contrast, the Großer Hermannsberg and Ruppberg (see below) that rise to the southwest of the ridge are better known and popular tourist destinations. To the northeast, where the terrain gradually flattens out, are two of the 3 largest reservoirs in the Thuringian Forest (see below). The best known rock formation in the mountain range, the Falkenstein, is also found in this area.

Notable summits include:
* Schützenberg (904&nbsp;m, main crest southwest of Oberhof)
* Greifenberg (901&nbsp;m, main crest west of Oberhof)
* Gebrannter Stein (897&nbsp;m, south of the Rennsteig, north of Zella-Mehlis) with remarkable cliffs
* Großer Hermannsberg (867&nbsp;m, southwest flank) - local mountain for Steinbach-Hallenberg, with observation tower
* Ruppberg (866&nbsp;m, southwest flank) - local mountain (northwest) for Zella-Mehlis, with observation tower
==== Rivers and lakes ====
The northeastern flank of the mountains is drained by right tributaries of the Apfelstädt, especially the Schmalwasser, and left tributaries of the Ohra, notably the Kernwasser, via the (Apfelstädt,) Gera and Unstrut into the Saale. The Apfelstädt is impounded by the Tambach-Dietharz Dam into a small lake and the Schmalwasser and Ohra by the Schmalwasser and Ohra Dams into larger reservoirs.
The south is drained by the Asbach which flows via the Stille into the Schmalkalde and by rivers and streams belonging to the fan-like system of tributaries of Hasel (Werra), in particular the Schwarza,<ref>The Schwarza is called the Haselbach in its upper reaches and the Schönau in its middle course</ref> Häselbach,<ref>The Häselbach is, especially in its source region, also called the Dürre Hasel</ref> Lichtenau and a stream from Albrechts, feeding into the Werra.
=== Gehlberg Thuringian Forest ===

This region between federal roads B 4 between Ilmenau and Stützerbach, following the rivers Ilm, Lengwitz, and Nahe, and B 247 between Luisenthal and Suhl contains the three highest summits as well as the fifth highest summit of the whole range. The only settlements wholly within this region are Gehlberg north of Rennsteig and Vesser south of it. Parts of Schmiedefeld and Goldlauter-Heidersbach (part of Suhl) also extend into this part of the Forest. The highest summits crowning the mountain ridge are of volcanic origin. The terrain dips rapidly down to heights below 800 m towards the north-east, while heights remain above this altitude south-west of Rennsteig for some distance in the horseshoe-shaped Adlersberg massif.
Motorway A 71 and the Neudietendorf–Ritschenhausen railway pass under the Brandleite Massif between Gehlberg and Oberhof in Rennsteig road tunnel and Brandleite Tunnel.
The area is drained towards the north by the river Lütsche which feeds the Lütsche reservoir and by Wilde Gera and Zahme Gera towards Gera river and Unstrut, and by Freibach stream, a tributary of Ilm river, and towards the south by Lauter, a tributary of Hasel, and mainly by Erle, feeding the Erle reservoir, Breitenbach, Vesser, and Nahe into Schleuse.
Notable summits include:
* Großer Beerberg (984&nbsp;m, main crest 3,4&nbsp;km east of Zella-Mehlis, highest elevation in the Thuringian Forest)
* Schneekopf (978 m), transmitter site and observation tower
* Großer Finsterberg (944 m), with observation tower
* Großer Eisenberg (907 m), whose name bears witness to ore mining activities in the past
* Adlersberg massive (up to 892 m) with Ringberghaus hotel on Ringberg (746 m), a northwestern foothill
=== Frauenwald-Neustadt Thuringian Forest ===
The region around Frauenwald and Neustadt forms the most south-eastern part of the Thuringian forest proper. It is limited by state road B 4 in the northwest, and by a line along the rivers Talwasser (with Ilmsenbach), Neubrunn, and Schleuse. The adjacent Thuringian Slate Mountains form a geographically and geologically separate natural region, although they are often popularly referred to as a continuation of the former range. Populated places wholly within the region are Frauenwald, Allzunah, Neustadt am Rennsteig, and Oehrenstock. Parts of Stützerbach also reach into this area. Roads follow the Rennsteig, the mountain crests, or the valleys of the rivers.
The main ridge of the mountain range exceeds altitudes of 800 m in several places. The highest and best known summit is Kickelhahn (861 metres above sea level) southwest of Ilmenau. As seen from there, all secondary crests towards the northeast and the southwest clearly originate from the main one and show even and gentle slopes, not counting the steep descent into the foreland. The southwestern crests reach altitudes of about 800 m. The dividing valleys are often narrow gorges.
The zone drains:
*Northeast by the fan of the Ilm's tributaries, towards the Saale
*Southwest by the Nahe, Trenkbach, Schleuse, Gabel, Tanne, and tributaries of the Neubrunn towards the Werra. 
The Schleuse, Gabel and Tanne feed the Schönbrunn reservoir.
Notable summits include:
* Kickelhahn (861 m) with observation tower, "backyard mountain" of Ilmenau
* Großer Dreiherrnstein (838 m), 500 m from the tripoint of the former countries Schwarzburg-Arnstadt, Saxe-Eisenach, and Henneberg
* Großer Hundskopf (824 m) with a transmitter site on its foothill Kalter Staudenkopf (768 m)
== Tourism and sights ==
Due to its geographical characteristics and the favourable climate, the Thuringian Forest is an important year-round tourist destination. Winter sports play an important role, facilities of international significance are concentrated around Oberhof. Famous sights include Wartburg Castle outside Eisenach where Martin Luther lived in exile, the selenite cave (Marienglashöhle, a former mine) near Friedrichroda, the firearms museum in Suhl, and the historic town centres of Eisenach and Ilmenau. 
The Rennsteig trail is the most popular long-distance hiking trail in Germany. It is part of:
*the mountainous path from Eisenach to Budapest
*the E3 European long distance path
*the Thüringen-Rhein-Wanderweg
*(partly) the pilgrims' way or Via Porta. The latter links the abbeys of Volkenroda and Waldsassen.
