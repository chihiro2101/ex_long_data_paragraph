USS Mustin (DDG-89)

==Namesakes==
Often referred to as "The Father of Naval Aviation", Captain Henry C. Mustin (1874–1923), an 1896 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, was the principal architect for the concept of the catapult launch. He married Corinne DeForest Montague, great-granddaughter of Commodore Arthur Sinclair, and a first cousin and close confidante of Wallis Simpson who became involved in a controversial relationship with King Edward VIII of Great Britain who abdicated to marry her in 1936.<ref name= "Mortonp. "></ref> The Mustins had three children: Lloyd M., Henry A. and Gordon S.
As a Lieutenant Commander in January 1914, Mustin established Naval Aeronautic Station Pensacola, the Navy's first permanent air station together with a flight school, and became its first Commanding Officer. The first flight was made from the station on 2 February by LT J. H. Towers and ENS G. de Chevalier. On 5 November 1915, while underway, LCDR Mustin successfully flew an AB-2 flying boat off the stern of the USS North Carolina (ACR-12) in Pensacola Bay, FL, making the first ever recorded catapult launching from a ship underway. In 1899, he earned a commendation for distinguished service in the capture of Vigan, Philippines. The first operational missions of naval aircraft were flown under his command during the Veracruz operation in 1914 and he was the first to hold the title: Commander, Aircraft Squadrons, Pacific Fleet. Designated Naval Aviator Number Eleven, Captain Mustin was instrumental in the design of the Naval Aviator insignia.
His eldest son, Vice Admiral Lloyd M. Mustin (1911–1999), a 1932 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, took part in developing the Navy's first lead-computing anti-aircraft gun sight, which proved of major importance in the air-sea actions of World War II, and served on the cruiser USS Atlanta (CL-51) during the naval battle of Guadalcanal. His ship was lost during that action; with other survivors he landed on Guadalcanal and served ashore with a naval unit attached to the 1st Marine Division. His post-war service included commands at sea and development and evaluation of weapon systems. He later served as director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Vice Admiral Mustin's two sons, Vice Admiral Henry C. Mustin and Lieutenant Commander Thomas M. Mustin continued their family's tradition of military service. Vice Admiral Henry Mustin, a 1955 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, was a decorated Vietnam veteran who served in the 1980s as the Naval Inspector General, Commander, Second Fleet and Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Plans and Policy. Lieutenant Commander Mustin, also a Naval Academy graduate (1962) earned a Bronze Star during the Vietnam War for river patrol combat action.
