Aircraft noise pollution

==Mechanisms of sound production==
Aircraft noise is noise pollution produced by an aircraft or its components, whether on the ground while parked such as auxiliary power units, while taxiing, on run-up from propeller and jet exhaust, during take off, underneath and lateral to departure and arrival paths, over-flying while en route, or during landing. A moving aircraft including the jet engine or propeller causes compression and rarefaction of the air, producing motion of air molecules. This movement propagates through the air as pressure waves. If these pressure waves are strong enough and within the audible frequency spectrum, a sensation of hearing is produced. Different aircraft types have different noise levels and frequencies. The noise originates from three main sources:
* Engine and other mechanical noise
* Aerodynamic noise
* Noise from aircraft systems
===Engine and other mechanical noise===

Much of the noise in propeller aircraft comes equally from the propellers and aerodynamics. Helicopter noise is aerodynamically induced noise from the main and tail rotors and mechanically induced noise from the main gearbox and various transmission chains. The mechanical sources produce narrow band high intensity peaks relating to the rotational speed and movement of the moving parts. In computer modelling terms noise from a moving aircraft can be treated as a line source.
Aircraft gas turbine engines (jet engines) are responsible for much of the aircraft noise during takeoff and climb, such as the buzzsaw noise generated when the tips of the fan blades reach supersonic speeds. However, with advances in noise reduction technologies—the airframe is typically more noisy during landing.
The majority of engine noise is due to jet noise—although high bypass-ratio turbofans do have considerable fan noise. The high velocity jet leaving the back of the engine has an inherent shear layer instability (if not thick enough) and rolls up into ring vortices. This later breaks down into turbulence. The SPL associated with engine noise is proportional to the jet speed (to a high power). Therefore, even modest reductions in exhaust velocity will produce a large reduction in jet noise.
Engines are the main source of aircraft noise. The PowerJet SaM146 in the Sukhoi Superjet 100 features 3D aerodynamic fan blades and a nacelle with a long Exhaust mixer nozzle to reduce noise.<ref name=AvWeek18dec2017></ref>
===Aerodynamic noise===
Aerodynamic noise arises from the airflow around the aircraft fuselage and control surfaces. This type of noise increases with aircraft speed and also at low altitudes due to the density of the air. Jet-powered aircraft create intense noise from aerodynamics. Low-flying, high-speed military aircraft produce especially loud aerodynamic noise.
The shape of the nose, windshield or canopy of an aircraft affects the sound produced. Much of the noise of a propeller aircraft is of aerodynamic origin due to the flow of air around the blades. The helicopter main and tail rotors also give rise to aerodynamic noise. This type of aerodynamic noise is mostly low frequency determined by the rotor speed.
Typically noise is generated when flow passes an object on the aircraft, for example, the wings or landing gear. There are broadly two main types of airframe noise:
* Bluff Body Noise – the alternating vortex shedding from either side of a bluff body, creates low-pressure regions (at the core of the shed vortices) which manifest themselves as pressure waves (or sound). The separated flow around the bluff body is quite unstable, and the flow "rolls up" into ring vortices—which later break down into turbulence.<ref name="bluff"></ref>
* Edge Noise – when turbulent flow passes the end of an object or gaps in a structure (high lift device clearance gaps) the associated fluctuations in pressure are heard as the sound propagates from the edge of the object (radially downwards).<ref name="bluff"/>
===Noise from aircraft systems===
Cockpit and cabin pressurization and conditioning systems are often a major contributor within cabins of both civilian and military aircraft. However, one of the most significant sources of cabin noise from commercial jet aircraft, other than the engines, is the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), an on‑board generator used in aircraft to start the main engines, usually with compressed air, and to provide electrical power while the aircraft is on the ground. Other internal aircraft systems can also contribute, such as specialized electronic equipment in some military aircraft.
==Health effects==
Aircraft engines are the major source of noise and can exceed 140 decibels (dB) during takeoff. While airborne, the main sources of noise are the engines and the high speed turbulence over the fuselage.<ref></ref>
There are health consequences of elevated sound levels. Elevated workplace or other noise can cause hearing impairment, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, annoyance, sleep disturbance, and decreased school performance.<ref></ref> Although some hearing loss occurs naturally with age,<ref name="Rosenhall1990"></ref> in many developed nations the impact of noise is sufficient to impair hearing over the course of a lifetime.<ref name="Schmid"></ref><ref>Senate Public Works Committee, Noise Pollution and Abatement Act of 1972, S. Rep. No. 1160, 92nd Cong. 2nd session</ref> Elevated noise levels can create stress, increase workplace accident rates, and stimulate aggression and other anti-social behaviors.<ref name="isbn0-12-427455-2"></ref> Airport noise has been linked to high blood pressure.<ref>
===Night flying restrictions===
At Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports in London, UK and Frankfurt Airport in Germany, night flying restrictions apply to reduce noise exposure at night.<ref name="DFT"></ref><ref name="DFT2"></ref>
=== Satellite-based navigation systems ===
A series of trials were undertaken at London's Heathrow Airport, between December 2013 and November 2014, as part of the UK's "Future Airspace Strategy", and the Europe-wide "Single European Sky" modernisation project. The trials demonstrated that using satellite-based navigation systems it was possible to offer noise relief to more surrounding communities, although this led to a significant unexpected rise in noise complaints (61,650 <ref>Anderson Acoustics, urltoken Westerly And Easterly Departure Trials 2014 - Noise Analysis & Community Response, retrieved 29 November 2017</ref>) due to the concentrated flight paths. The study found that steeper angles for take-off and landing led to fewer people experiencing aircraft noise and that noise relief could be shared by using more precise flight paths, allowing control of the noise footprint of departing aircraft. Noise relief could be enhanced by switching flight paths, for example by using one flight path in the morning and another in the afternoon.<ref></ref>
=== Technological advances ===
==== Engine design ====
Modern High bypass turbofans are not only more fuel efficient, but also much quieter than older turbojet and low-bypass turbofan engines. On newer engines Turbofan#Noise further reduce the engine's noise,<ref></ref> while on older engines the use of hush kits are used to help mitigate their excessive noise.
==== Engine location ====
The ability to reduce noise may be limited if engines remain below aircraft's wings. NASA expects a cumulative 20–30&nbsp;dB below Stage 4 limits by 2026–2031, but keeping aircraft noise within airport boundaries requires at least a 40–50&nbsp;dB reduction. NASA found over-wing and mid-fuselage nacelles could reduce noise by 30–40&nbsp;dB, even 40–50&nbsp;dB for hybrid wing body which may be essential for open rotors.<ref name="AvWeek6may2016" />
By 2020, helicopter technologies now in development, plus new procedures could reduce noise levels by 10&nbsp;dB and noise footprints by 50%, but more advances are needed to preserve or expand heliports. Package delivery UAS will need to characterize their noise, establish limits and reduce their impact.<ref name=AvWeek6may2016></ref>

Aircraft noise pollution refers to noise produced by aircraft in flight that has been associated with several negative stress-mediated health effects, from sleep disorders to cardiovascular ones.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> Governments have enacted extensive controls that apply to aircraft designers, manufacturers, and operators, resulting in improved procedures and cuts in pollution.
Sound production is divided into three categories:
* Mechanical noise—rotation of the engine parts, most noticeable when fan blades reach supersonic speeds.
* Aerodynamic noise—from the airflow around the surfaces of the aircraft, especially when flying low at high speeds.
* Noise from aircraft systems—cockpit and cabin pressurization and conditioning systems, and Auxiliary Power units.
