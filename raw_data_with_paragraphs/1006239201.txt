Willy Russell

==Early life==
Russell was born in Whiston, Lancashire (which is now Merseyside). On leaving school, aged 15, he became a ladies' hairdresser, eventually running his own salon, until the age of 20 when he decided to try to go back to college. This led to him qualifying as a teacher. During these years, Russell also worked as a semi-professional singer, writing and performing his own songs in folk clubs.<ref>Chrisafis, Angelique. urltoken "Why the working class love Sartre" The Guardian, 6 July 2001</ref>

Russell (with musical collaborator Bob Eaton) realised a long-held ambition to develop Our Day Out further and after extensive rewriting, and recomposing created Our Day Out (musical). This modern musical retelling retains all the characters and plot of the original but with the action brought forward to today with a new score and lyrics to reflect this twenty first century setting. The musical was produced in 2010 at the Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool.<ref>Roberts, John. urltoken "'Our Day Out' – Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool", thereviewshub.com, 5 September 2010.</ref><ref> urltoken "Brief Encounter With … Willy Russell", whatsonstage.com, 9 August 2010</ref>
The Wrong Boy, Willy Russell's first novel, was published in 2000. The book was well received and attracted a wide readership in the UK and the many countries where it was published in translation. In 2004, Russell returned to his original singer/songwriter roots, releasing his album, Hoovering the Moon on Pure Records. Willy also co-produced the Tim Firth album Harmless Flirting.
In 2013, the Archive and Special Collections department of Liverpool John Moores University established the Willy Russell Archive containing manuscripts, programmes, publicity and media material including newspaper cuttings and press releases, correspondence, legal, financial and administrative documents, records relating to the casting and audition process, audio and film material, and promotional ephemera. The material was produced throughout the course of Russell's career and is a comprehensive representation of his work to date. It also illustrates Willy Russell's collaborative works, both written and musical.<ref> urltoken "Willy Russell: Behind the Scenes", ljmu.ac.uk, 4 November 2015.</ref><ref>Jones, Catherine. urltoken "Willy Russell archive launched at Liverpool John Moores University" liverpoolecho.co.uk, 28 November 2013.</ref>
