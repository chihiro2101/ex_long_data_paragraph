=== History in India ===
The Pure Land teachings were first developed in India, and were very popular in Kashmir and Central Asia, where they may have originated.<ref>Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. p. 104</ref> Pure Land sutras were brought from the Gandhara region to China as early as 147 CE, when the Kushan monk Lokakṣema began translating the first Buddhist sūtras into Chinese.<ref></ref> The earliest of these translations show evidence of having been translated from the Gāndhārī language, a Prakrit.<ref>Mukherjee, Bratindra Nath. India in Early Central Asia. 1996. p. 15</ref> There are also images of Amitābha with the bodhisattvas Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmaprāpta which were made in Gandhāra during the Kushan era.<ref></ref>
In the Buddhist traditions of India, Pure Land doctrines and practices were disseminated by well-known exponents of the Mahāyāna teachings, including Nāgārjuna and Vasubandhu.<ref>Inagaki, Hisao. The Three Pure Land Sutras. 2003. pp. xiii–xiv</ref> Pure Land schools arose because of the belief that humans were becoming incapable of Dharma, emphasizing that humans needed help from another power; that power being Amitābha Buddha.<ref></ref> Although Amitābha is honored and venerated in Pure Land traditions, this was clearly distinguished from worship of the Hindu gods, as Pure Land practice has its roots in the Buddhist ideal of the bodhisattva.<ref name=Inagaki-xiv>Inagaki, Hisao. The Three Pure Land Sutras. 2003. p. xiv</ref>
==== Pure Land sutras ====
The three principal Pure Land sūtras are the Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra, Amitayurdhyana Sutra and the Shorter Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra.<ref></ref> These sutras describe Amitābha and his Pure Land of Bliss, called Sukhavati. Also related to the Pure Land tradition is the Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra, which gives an early description of the practice of nianfo as a meditation method, although it does not enumerate any vows of Amitābha or the qualities of Sukhāvatī.
 In addition to these sutras, many other Mahāyāna texts also feature Amitābha, and a total of 290 such works have been identified in the Taishō Tripiṭaka.<ref>Inagaki, Hisao. The Three Pure Land Sutras. 2003. p. xiii</ref>
Andrew Skilton writes that the descriptions of Sukhāvatī given in the Sukhāvatīvyūha sūtras suggests that these descriptions were originally used for meditation: "This land, called Sukhāvatī or "blissful," is described in great detail, in a way that suggests that the sūtras were to be used as guides to mental image meditation, and also gives an impression of a magical world of intense visual and sonorous delight.<ref>Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 1997. p. 104</ref>
In the Infinite Life Sutra, Gautama Buddha begins by describing to his attendant Ananda a past life of the buddha Amitābha. He states that in a past life, Amitābha was once a king who renounced his kingdom, and became a monastic bodhisattva named Dharmākara ("Dharma Storehouse").<ref name=Inagaki-xvi>Inagaki, Hisao. The Three Pure Land Sutras. 2003. p. xvi</ref> Under the guidance of the buddha Lokeśvararāja ("World Sovereign King"), innumerable buddha-lands throughout the ten directions were revealed to him.<ref name=Inagaki-xvi/> After meditating for five eons as a bodhisattva, he then made a great series of vows to save all sentient beings, and through his great merit, created the realm of Sukhāvatī ("Ultimate Bliss").<ref name=Inagaki-xvi/><ref name="autogenerated1"></ref> This land of Sukhāvatī would later come to be known as the Pure Land in Chinese translation.

The Pure Land teachings first became prominent in China with the founding of Donglin Temple at Mount Lu by Huiyuan in 402. As a young man, Huiyuan practiced Daoism, but felt the theories of immortality to be vague and unreliable, and unrepresentative of the ultimate truth.<ref>Nan, Huai-Chin. Basic Buddhism: Exploring Buddhism and Zen. 1997. p. 83</ref> Instead, he turned to Buddhism and became a monk learning under Dao'an . Later he founded a monastery at the top of Mount Lu and invited well-known literati to study and practice Buddhism there, where they formed the White Lotus Society .<ref>Nan, Huai-Chin. Basic Buddhism: Exploring Buddhism and Zen. 1997. p. 81</ref> They accepted the Shorter Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra and the Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra as their standards among the Buddhist sūtras, and they advocated the practice of reciting the name of Amitābha Buddha in order to attain rebirth in the western pure land of Sukhāvatī.<ref>Nan, Huai-Chin. Basic Buddhism: Exploring Buddhism and Zen. 1997. p. 82</ref> Mount Lu is regarded as being among the most sacred religious sites of the Pure Land Buddhist tradition,<ref></ref> and the site of the first Pure Land gathering.<ref></ref>
The Pure Land teachings and meditation methods quickly spread throughout China and were systematized by a series of elite monastic thinkers, namely Tanluan, Daochuo, Shandao, and others. The main teaching of the Chinese Pure Land tradition is based on focusing the mind with Mindfulness of the Buddha (Skt. through recitation of the name of Amitābha Buddha, so as to attain rebirth in his pure land of Sukhāvatī.<ref>Nan, Huai-Chin. Basic Buddhism: Exploring Buddhism and Zen. 1997. p. 91</ref> Early Pure Land as practiced in China by Tanluan is described as follows:
=== Japanese Buddhism ===
In Japanese Buddhism, Pure Land teachings developed into independent institutional sects, as can be seen in the Jōdo-shū, Jōdo Shinshū, Yuzu Nembutsu, and Ji-shū.<ref> urltoken Guide on Buddhism for America</ref>
The majority of the important schools of Japanese Buddhism developed in the middle ages, between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries. However they were mostly influenced by the Tendai school (Chinese: Tientai in the sixth century) as their founding monks were all trained originally in the school. Its teachings were based on the Lotus Sūtra and Mahāyāna Nirvāṇa Sūtra, encompassing a wide range of teachings and eclectic practices of austerities.

Strong institutional boundaries exist between sects which serve to clearly separate the Japanese Pure Land schools from the Japanese Zen schools.<ref name=faces/> One notable exception to this is found in the Ōbaku Zen school, which was founded in Japan during the 17th century by the Chinese Buddhist monk Ingen (Chinese Yinyuan Longqi). The Ōbaku school of Zen retains many Chinese features such as mindfulness of Amitābha through recitation and recitation of the Pure Land sūtras.<ref>Baroni, Helen Josephine. Iron Eyes: The Life and Teachings of the Ōbaku Zen master Tetsugen Dōko. 2006. pp. 5–6</ref>
Upon encountering Japanese Pure Land traditions which emphasize faith, many westerners saw outward parallels between these traditions and Protestantism. This has led many western authors to speculate about possible connections between these traditions.<ref name="Bloom, Alfred 2013">Bloom, Alfred. The Shin Buddhist Classical Tradition. 2013. p. xii</ref> However, the cosmology, internal assumptions, and underlying doctrines and practices are now known to have many differences.<ref name="Bloom, Alfred 2013"/>

Pure Land Buddhism ; ; ; , also referred to as Amidism in English,<ref> urltoken Amidism, Britannica Online Encyclopedia</ref><ref> urltoken Amidism The Columbia Encyclopedia</ref> is a broad branch of Mahayana and one of the most widely practiced traditions of Buddhism in East Asia. Pure Land is a tradition of Buddhist teachings that are focused on the Buddha Amitābha. The three primary texts of the tradition, known as the "Three Pure Land Sutras", are the Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra (Infinite Life Sutra), Amitayurdhyana Sutra (Contemplation Sutra) and the Shorter Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra (Amitabha Sutra).
Pure Land oriented practices and concepts are found within basic Mahāyāna Buddhist cosmology, and form an important component of the Mahāyāna Buddhist traditions of China, Japan, Korea, Tibet and Vietnam. The term "Pure Land Buddhism" is used to describe both the Pure Land soteriology of Mahayana Buddhism, which may be better understood as "Pure Land traditions" or "Pure Land teachings," and the separate Pure Land sects that developed in Japan from the work of Hōnen. Pure Land Buddhism is built on the belief that we will never have a world which is not corrupt, so we must strive for re-birth in another plane, referred to as the "Pure Land".<ref></ref>
