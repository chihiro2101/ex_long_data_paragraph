Guiana Space Centre

=== BEC / ELA-1 / ELV ===
Originally built in the 1960s under the name of Base Équatoriale du CECLES (BEC) , , the pad located at was designed for the Europa (rocket). One Europa-II was launched from the site, before the programme was cancelled.
The pad was demolished, and subsequently rebuilt as the first launch complex for Ariane rockets. Renamed ELA (later redesignated ELA-1) , it was used for Ariane 1 and Ariane 2 and 3 launches until being retired in 1989.<ref></ref>
In November 2001, it was renamed ELV pad and refurbished again for the Vega rocket. The first launch was performed on 13 February 2012.<ref></ref>
=== ELA-2 ===
The ELA-2 pad , located at had been used for Ariane 4 launches until 2003.
=== ELA-3 ===
ELA-3 has been active for Ariane 5 launches since 1996 (Ariane 501). This facility is located at and covers an area of .<ref></ref>
=== ELA-4 ===
ELA-4 is presently under construction, intended for future Ariane 6 launches. This facility is located at .<ref></ref>
=== ELS / Soyuz at CSG ===
ESA has built ELS at for launching Russian-built Soyuz-2 rockets. The first Soyuz launch from ELS was postponed several times, but launched on 21 October 2011.<ref> urltoken SpaceflightNow's VS01 flight status page </ref>
ELS is located on the territory of Sinnamary commune, from Kourou harbor.<ref></ref> It is northwest of the site used for the Ariane 5 launches. Under the terms of the Russo-European joint venture, ESA will augment its own launch vehicle fleet with Soyuz rockets — using them to launch ESA or commercial payloads — and the Russians will get access to the Kourou spaceport for launching their own payloads with Soyuz rockets. Russia will use the Guiana Space Centre in addition to Baikonur Cosmodrome. The Guiana location has the significant benefit of greatly increased payload capability, owing to the near equatorial position. A Soyuz rocket with a 1.7 tonnes to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) performance from Baikonur, will increase its payload potential to 2.8 tonnes from the Guiana launch site.<ref> urltoken Le Port Spatial de l'Europe (CNES) </ref>
The ELS project is being co-funded by Arianespace, ESA, and the European Union, with CNES being the prime contractor. The project has a projected cost of approximately €320 million, where €120 million are allocated for modernizing the Soyuz vehicle.<ref></ref> The official opening of the launch site construction occurred on 27 February 2007. Excavation work however, had previously begun several months beforehand.
On 13 September 2010, Spaceflight Now reported that after several delays in the construction of a mobile gantry the launch pad had been finished, and the first flight of the Soyuz was expected to occur in early 2011.<ref name="SFNOW-2010-09-13"></ref> By October 2010, 18 launch contracts had been signed. Arianespace has ordered 24 launchers from Russian industry.<ref name="arianespace-2010-10-11"></ref>
On 21 October 2011, two Galileo IOV-1 and IOV-2 satellites were launched using a Soyuz-2 rocket, in the "first Russian Soyuz vehicle ever launched from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana."<ref name=pa20111022></ref>
=== Final assembly building ===
Astrium assembles each Ariane 5 launcher in the Launcher Integration Building. The vehicle is then delivered to the Final Assembly Building for payload integration by Arianespace.<ref></ref> The Final Assembly Building is located from the ELA-3 launch zone. The mobile launch table completes the trip with an Ariane 5 in about one hour. It is then secured in place over the launch pad's flame ducts.<ref></ref>

=== Launch safety ===
Fire safety is ensured by a detachment of the Paris Fire Brigade, a branch of the French Army. Security around the base is ensured by French Gendarmerie forces, assisted by the 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment of the French Foreign Legion. Before and during launch windows, CSG facility security is significantly enhanced by anti-personnel and anti-aircraft measures, the exact configurations of which are classified by the French military. All entrants to the launch complex are also subject to checks for proof of permission to enter the facility.
The Guiana Space Centre (as per CNES) also contains the Îles du Salut, a former penal colony including the infamous Devil's Island. Now a tourist site, the islands are under the launching trajectory for geosynchronous orbit and have to be evacuated during launches.
=== Early launches ===
