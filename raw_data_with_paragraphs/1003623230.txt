Consolidation bill

==Procedure==
Consolidation bills are introduced in the House of Lords which, by convention, has primacy in these matters. The Lords has the only substantive discussion on the bill, at its second reading, before the bill is sent to a Joint Committee of Parliament which may propose amendments to it. Subject to this, the Lords' third reading and all readings in the House of Commons are usually formalities and pass without debate.<ref name="factsheet" />
Most consolidation bills are proposed in the first instance by the Law Commission,<ref name="law comm" /><ref name="leeds"></ref> and it is this prior consideration that gives rise to the expedited process afforded to these bills.<ref name="leeds" /><ref></ref> Every consolidation bill proposed by the Law Commission has been passed by Parliament.<ref></ref>
Once a consolidation bill receives royal assent it becomes a consolidation Act. An example of a consolidation Act is the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000,<ref></ref> which consolidated into a single Act parts of sentencing legislation previously spread across twelve separate Acts.<ref name="law comm"></ref>
==Categories of consolidation bills==
There are five categories of bill that qualify as consolidation bills:<ref name="so"></ref>
#Bills which only re-enact existing law.
#Bills which consolidate previous laws with amendments, proposed in response to recommendations from the Law Commission.
#Bills to repeal existing legislation, again prepared by the Law Commission.
#Bills to repeal various obsolete or unnecessary parts of existing legislation.
#Bills which make corrections and minor improvements to existing legislation, prepared under the Consolidation of Enactments (Procedure) Act 1949.
The first three categories now account for almost all consolidation bills.<ref name="so" />

A consolidation bill is a bill introduced into the Parliament of the United Kingdom with the intention of consolidating several Acts of Parliament or Statutory Instruments into a single Act. Such bills simplify the statute book without significantly changing the state of the law,<ref name="factsheet"></ref><ref name="glossary"></ref> and are subject to an expedited Parliamentary procedure.
The parliamentary practice of legislating only for small portions of a subject at a time can create undue complexity in statute law. Acts relating to a particular subject often end up scattered over many years, and through the operation of clauses partially repealing or amending former acts, the specific meaning of the law regarding the subject becomes enveloped in intricate or contradictory expressions. For clarity, the law as expressed across many statutes is sometimes recast in a single statute, called a consolidation bill. 
By 1911, such bills had been passed dealing with subjects as diverse as customs, stamps and stamp duties, public health, weights and measures, sheriffs, coroners, county courts, housing, municipal corporations, libraries, trustees, copyhold, diseases of animals, merchant shipping, and friendly societies. 
These observations apply to the public general Acts of the legislature.

Such are the Lands Clauses Acts, the Companies Clauses Acts and the Railways Clauses Acts.<ref></ref>
