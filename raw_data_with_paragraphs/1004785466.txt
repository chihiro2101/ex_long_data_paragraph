Airborne early warning and control

==General characteristics==
Modern AEW&C systems can detect aircraft from up to away, well out of range of most surface-to-air missiles. One AEW&C aircraft flying at can cover an area of . Three such aircraft in overlapping orbits can cover the whole of Central Europe.<ref></ref> AEW&C systems communicate with friendly aircraft, vectoring fighters towards hostile aircraft or any flying unidentified object, providing data on threats and targets, help extend their sensor range and make offensive aircraft more difficult to track, since they no longer need to keep their own radar active (which can be detected by the enemy) to detect threats.
==History of development==
After having developed Chain Home—the first ground-based early-warning radar detection system—in the 1930s, the British developed a radar set that could be carried on an aircraft for what they termed "Air Controlled Interception". The intention was to cover the North West approaches where German long range Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor aircraft were threatening shipping. A Vickers Wellington bomber (serial R1629) was fitted with a rotating antenna array. It was tested for use against aerial targets and then for possible use against German E boats.<ref>Air-Britain, Aviation World, 2004</ref><ref>Hodges, R "Air controlled interception" Radar Development to 1945 R W Burns (ed)</ref> Another radar equipped Wellington with a different installation was used to direct Bristol Beaufighters toward Heinkel He 111s, which were air-launching V-1 flying bombs.<ref>Flypast April 1987: "The First AWACS"</ref>
In February 1944, US Navy ordered the development of a radar system that could be carried aloft in an aircraft under Project Cadillac.<ref>Hirst, 1983, p.59</ref> A prototype system was built and flown in August on a modified TBM Avenger torpedo bomber. Tests were successful, with the system being able to detect low flying formations at a range greater than . US Navy then ordered production of the TBM-3W, the first production AEW aircraft to enter service. TBM-3Ws fitted with the AN/APS-20 radar entered service in March 1945, with 27 eventually constructed.<ref>Hirst, 1983, p.64</ref>
The Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star, which first flew in 1949, served widely with US Air Force and US Navy. It provided the main AEW coverage for US forces during the Vietnam war. It remained operational until replaced with the E-3 AWACS. Developed roughly in parallel, N-class blimps were also used as AEW aircraft, filling gaps in radar coverage for the continental US, their tremendous endurance of over 200 hours being a major asset in an AEW aircraft. Lighter than air operations were discontinued in 1962 following a crash.
In 1958, the Soviet Tupolev was ordered to design an AEW aircraft.<ref name=Tu-114.1>Gordon, 2006, p.86</ref> After determining that the projected radar instrumentation wouldn't fit in a Tupolev Tu-95 or a Tupolev Tu-116, the decision was made to use the more capacious Tupolev Tu-114 instead.<ref name=Tu-114.1 /> This solved the problems with cooling and operator space that existed with the narrower Tu-95 and Tu-116 fuselage.<ref name=Tu-114.1 /> To meet range requirements, production examples were fitted with an air-to-air refueling probe.<ref name=Tu-114.2>Gordon, 2006, p.87</ref> The resulting system, the Tupolev Tu-126, entered service in 1965 with the Soviet Air Forces and remained in service until replaced by the Beriev A-50 in 1984.<ref name=Tu-114.2 />
After WWII, United Kingdom deployed a substantial AEW capability with American Douglas A-1 Skyraider, designated Skyraider AEW.1, which in turn were replaced by the Fairey Gannet AEW, using the same AN/APS-20 radar. With the retirement of conventional aircraft carriers, the Gannet was withdrawn and the Royal Air Force (RAF) installed the radars from the Gannets on Avro Shackleton MR.2 airframes, redesignated Shackleton AEW.2. To replace the Shackleton AEW.2, an AEW variant of the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod, known as the Nimrod AEW3, was ordered in 1974. After a protracted and problematic development, this was cancelled in 1986, and seven E-3Ds, designated Sentry AEW.1 in RAF service, were purchased instead.<ref name="spyflight"> urltoken "BAe Nimrod AEW 3."

==Current systems==
Many countries have developed their own AEW&C systems, although the Boeing E-3 Sentry and Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye are the most common systems worldwide. 
===Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS)===
Boeing produces a specific system<ref name="gap"></ref> with a 'rotodome' rotating radome designed and built by Boeing (Defense & Space Group) using Westinghouse (now Northrop Grumman) radar. It is mounted on either the E-3 Sentry aircraft (Boeing 707) or more recently the Boeing E-767 (Boeing 767), the latter only being used by the Japan Air Self-Defense Force.
When AWACS first entered service it represented a major advance in capability, being the first AEW to use a pulse-Doppler radar, which allowed it to track targets normally lost in ground clutter.<ref name=USAF>Neufeld, 1997, p.271</ref> Previously, low-flying aircraft could only be readily tracked over water.<ref name=USAF />
===E-2 Hawkeye===
The specially designed Grumman E-2 Hawkeye entered service in 1965 and has been operated by eight nations. Over 168 have been produced, and new versions continue to be developed, making it the most widely used AEW system.
===Beriev A-50===
The Russian Air Force is currently using approximately 15–20 Beriev A-50 in the AEW role. The "Mainstay" is based on the Ilyushin Il-76 airframe, with a large non-rotating disk radome on the rear fuselage. These replaced the 12 Tupolev Tu-126 that filled the role previously. The A-50 and A-50U will eventually be replaced by the Beriev A-100, which features an AESA array in the radome and is based on the updated Il-476.<ref>Butowski, Piotr. "Model Reveals A-100 Configuration". Air International, April 2014. Retrieved: 21 July 2014.</ref>
===KJ-2000===
In May 1997, Russia and Israel agreed to jointly fulfill an order from China to develop and deliver an early warning system. China reportedly ordered one Phalcon for $250 million, which entailed retrofitting a Russian-made Ilyushin-76 cargo plane also incorrectly reported as a Beriev A-50 Mainstay with advanced Elta electronic, computer, radar and communications systems. Beijing was expected to acquire several Phalcon AEW systems, and reportedly could buy at least three more and possibly up to eight of these systems, the prototype of which was planned for testing beginning in 2000. In July 2000 US pressured Israel to back out of the $1 billion agreement to sell China four Phalcon phased-array radar systems. Following the cancelled A-50I/Phalcon deal, China turned to indigenous solutions. The Phalcon radar and other electronic systems were taken off from the unfinished Il-76, and the airframe was handed to China via Russia in 2002. The Chinese AWACS has a unique phased array radar (PAR) carried in a round radome. Unlike the US AWACS aircraft, which rotate their rotodomes to give a 360 degree coverage, the radar antenna of the Chinese AWACS does not rotate. Instead, three PAR antenna modules are placed in a triangular configuration inside the round radome to provide a 360 degree coverage. The installation of equipment at the Il-76 began in late 2002 aircraft by Xian aircraft industries (Xian Aircraft Industry Co.). The first flight of an airplane KJ-2000 made in November 2003. All four machines will be equipped with this type. The last to be introduced into service the Chinese Air Force until the end of 2007.<ref name=" urltoken China is also developing a carrier based AEW&C, Xian KJ-600 via Y-7 derived Xian JZY-01 testbed.
===Others===
In 2003, the Indian Air Force (IAF) and Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) began a study of requirements for developing an Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWAC) system.<ref></ref> In 2015, DRDO delivered 3 AWACs, called Netra, to the air force with an advanced Indian AESA radar system fitted on the Brazilian Embraer EMB-145 air frame.<ref name=":0"></ref> Netra gives a 240-degree coverage of airspace. The Emb-145 also has air-to-air refuelling capability for longer surveillance time. The Indian Air Force also operates three Israeli EL/W-2090 systems, mounted on Ilyushin Il-76 airframes, the first of which first arrived on May 25, 2009.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The DRDO proposed a more advanced AWACS with a longer range and with a 360-degree coverage akin to the Phalcon system, based on the Airbus A330 airframe,<ref name=":0" /> but given the costs involved there is also the possibility of converting used A320 airliners as well.<ref name="a320conv1"></ref>
The Royal Australian Air Force, Republic of Korea Air Force and the Turkish Air Force are deploying Boeing 737 AEW&C aircraft. The Boeing 737 AEW&C has a fixed, active electronically scanned array radar antenna instead of a rotating one.
The Swedish Air Force uses the S 100D Argus ASC890 as its AEW platform. The S 100D Argus is based on the Saab 340 with an Ericsson Erieye radar radar. Saab also offers the Bombardier Global 6000-based Globaleye.
The Hellenic Air Force, Brazilian Air Force and Mexican Air Force use the Embraer R-99 with an Ericsson Erieye PS-890 radar, as on the S 100D.
In early 2006, the Pakistan Air Force ordered six Erieye AEW equipped Saab 2000 from Sweden.<ref></ref> In December 2006, the Pakistan Navy requested three excess P-3 Orion aircraft to be equipped with Hawkeye 2000 AEW systems.<ref></ref> China and Pakistan also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the joint development of AEW&C systems.<ref></ref>
Israel has developed the IAI/Elta EL/M-2075 Phalcon system, which uses an AESA (active electronically scanned array) in lieu of a rotodome antenna. The system was the first such system to enter service. The original Phalcon was mounted on a Boeing 707 <ref name="B707 Phalcon, Israeli Weapons.com"></ref> and developed for the Israeli Defense Force and for export. Israel uses IAI EL/W-2085 airborne early warning and control multi-band radar system on Gulfstream G550.
==Helicopter AEW systems==
The British Sea King ASaC7 naval helicopter was operated from both the Invincible-class aircraft carriers and later the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean. The creation of Sea King ASaC7, and earlier AEW.2 and AEW.5 was the consequence of lessons learnt by the Royal Navy during the 1982 Falklands War when the lack of AEW coverage for the task force was a major tactical handicap, and rendered them vulnerable to low level attack. The Spanish Navy fields the SH-3 Sea King in the same role, operated from the LPH Juan Carlos I.
The AgustaWestland AW101 of the Italian Navy is operated from the aircraft carriers Cavour and Garibaldi. In 2018 the British will replace their Sea Kings with a modular "Crowsnest" system that can be fitted to any of their Merlin HM2 fleet.<ref></ref>
The Russian-built Kamov Ka-31 is deployed by the Indian Navy on the aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya and Talwar-class frigate and will be deployed on the .<ref></ref> The Russian Navy has two Ka-31R variants, at least one of which was deployed on their aircraft carrier Kuznetsov in 2016.<ref></ref> It is fitted with E-801M Oko (Eye) airborne electronic warfare radar that can track 20 targets simultaneously, detecting aircraft up to away, and surface warships up to distant.

An airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) system is an airborne radar picket system designed to detect aircraft, ships and vehicles at long ranges and perform command and control of the battlespace in an air engagement by directing fighter and attack aircraft strikes. AEW&C units are also used to carry out surveillance, including over ground targets and frequently perform C2BM (command and control, battle management) functions similar to an Air Traffic Controller given military command over other forces. When used at altitude, the radar on the aircraft allows the operators to detect and track targets and distinguish between friendly and hostile aircraft much farther away than a similar ground-based radar.<ref>Neufeld, 1997, p.276</ref> Like a ground-based radar, it can be detected by opposing forces, but because of its mobility and extended sensor range, it is much less vulnerable to counter-attacks.<ref>Neufeld, 1997, p.278</ref>
AEW&C aircraft are used for both defensive and offensive air operations, and are to NATO and US-trained or integrated air forces what the combat information center is to a naval warship, in addition to being a highly mobile and powerful radar platform. The system is used offensively to direct fighters to their target locations, and defensively, directing counterattacks on enemy forces, both air and ground. So useful is the advantage of command and control aircraft operating at a high altitude, that some navies operate such aircraft from their warships at sea. In the case of US Navy, the Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye AEW&C aircraft is assigned to its supercarriers to protect them and augment their onboard command information centers (CICs). The designation airborne early warning (AEW) was used for earlier similar aircraft,<ref>Gordon, 2010, p.3</ref> such as the Fairey Gannet AEW.3 and Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star, and continues to be used by the RAF for its Sentry AEW1, while AEW&C (airborne early warning and control) emphasizes the command and control capabilities that may not be present on smaller or simpler radar picket aircraft. AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) is the name of the specific system installed in the E-3 and Japanese Boeing E-767 AEW&C airframes, but is often used as a general synonym for AEW&C.<ref> urltoken Boeing Delivers First Two 767 AWACS, Introduces Newest Member of AEW&C Family</ref><ref name=gap />
The first known aerial engagement with both opposing sides using Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft was in the Indian subcontinent, during the 2019 Jammu and Kashmir airstrikes between India and Pakistan, with India using EL/W-2090 AWACS and Pakistan using the Saab 2000.<ref> urltoken
