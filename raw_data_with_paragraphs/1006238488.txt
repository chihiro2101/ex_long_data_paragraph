Hysteria

== History ==
The word hysteria originates from the Greek word for uterus, hystera.<ref name=":0" /> The oldest record of hysteria dates back to 1900 B.C. when Egyptians recorded behavioral abnormalities in adult women on medical papyrus.<ref name=":0" /> The Egyptians attributed the behavioral disturbances to a wandering uterus—thus later dubbing the condition hysteria.<ref name=":0" /> To treat hysteria Egyptian doctors prescribed various medications.<ref name=":0" /> For example, doctors put strong smelling substances on the patients’ vulvas to encourage the uterus to return to its proper position.<ref name=":0" /> Another tactic was to smell or swallow unsavory herbs to encourage the uterus to flee back to the lower part of the female’s abdomen.<ref name=":0" />
The ancient Greeks accepted the ancient Egyptians’ explanation for hysteria; however, they included in their definition of hysteria the inability to bear children or the failure to marry.<ref name=":0" /> Ancient Romans also attributed hysteria to an abnormality in the womb; however, discarded the traditional explanation of a wandering uterus.<ref name=":0" /> Instead, the ancient Romans credited hysteria to a disease of the womb or a disruption in reproduction (i.e., a miscarriage, menopause, etc.).<ref name=":0" /> Hysteria theories from the ancient Egyptians, ancient Greeks, and ancient Romans were the basis of the Western understanding of hysteria.<ref name=":0" />
Between the fifth and thirteenth centuries, however, the increasing influence of Christianity in the Latin West altered medical and public understanding of hysteria.<ref name=":9"></ref> St. Augustine's writings suggested that human suffering resulted from sin, and thus, hysteria became perceived as satanic possession.<ref name=":9" /> With the shift in perception of hysteria came a shift in treatment options.<ref name=":9" /> Instead of admitting patients to a hospital, the church began treating patients through prayers, amulets, and exorcisms.<ref name=":9" /> Furthermore, during the Renaissance period many patients of hysteria were prosecuted as witches and underwent interrogations, torture, and execution.<ref name=":9" />
However, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries activists and scholars worked to change the perception of hysteria back to a medical condition.<ref name=":4" /> Particularly, French physician Charles Lepois insisted that hysteria was a malady of the brain.<ref name=":10"></ref> In addition, in 1697, English physician Thomas Sydenham theorized that hysteria was an emotional condition, instead of a physical condition.<ref name=":4" /> Many physicians followed Lepois and Sydenham's lead and hysteria became disassociated with the soul and the womb.<ref name=":10" /> During this time period, science started to focalize hysteria in the central nervous system.<ref name=":10" /> As doctors developed a greater understanding of the human nervous system, the neurological model of hysteria was created, which further propelled the conception of hysteria as a mental disorder.<ref name=":10" />
In 1859, Paul Briquet defined hysteria as a chronic syndrome manifesting in many unexplained symptoms throughout the body's organ systems.<ref name=":5"></ref> What Briquet described became known as Briquet's syndrome, or Somatization disorders, in 1971.<ref name=":6"></ref> Over a ten year period, Briquet conducted 430 case studies of patients with hysteria.<ref name=":5" /> Following Briquet, Jean-Martin Charcot studied women in an asylum in France and used hypnosis as treatment.<ref name=":4" /> He also mentored Pierre Janet, another French psychologist, who studied five of hysteria's symptoms (anesthesia, amnesia, abulia, motor control diseases, and character change) in depth and proposed that hysteria symptoms occurred due to a lapse in consciousness.<ref name=":7"></ref> Both Charcot and Janet inspired Sigmund Freud's work.<ref name=":2"></ref> Freud theorized hysteria stemmed from childhood sexual abuse or repression, and was also one of the first to apply hysteria to men.<ref name=":2" />
During the 20th century, as psychiatry advanced in the West, anxiety and depression diagnoses began to replace hysteria diagnoses in Western countries.<ref name=":4" /> For example, from 1949 to 1978, annual admissions of hysteria patients in England and Wales decreased by roughly two thirds.<ref name=":4" /> With the decrease of hysteria patients in Western cultures came an increase in anxiety and depression patients.<ref name=":4" /> Although declining in the West, in Eastern countries such as Sudan, Egypt, and Lebanon hysteria diagnoses remained consistent.<ref name=":4" /> Theories for why hysteria diagnoses began to decline vary, but many historians infer that World War II, westernization, and migration shifted Western mental health expectations.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":2" /> Twentieth century western societies expected depression and anxiety manifest itself more in post World War II generations and displaced individuals; and thus, individuals reported or were diagnosed accordingly.<ref name=":4" /> In addition, medical advancements explained ailments that were previously attributed to hysteria such as epilepsy or infertility.<ref name=":6" /> In 1980, after a gradual decline in diagnoses and reports, hysteria was removed from the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which had included hysteria as a mental disorder from its second publication in 1968.<ref name=":6" />

== Notable figures ==
=== Jean-Martin Charcot ===
In the late nineteenth century, French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, attempted to tackle what he referred to as, "the great neurosis" or hysteria.<ref name=":8"></ref> Charcot theorized that hysteria was a hereditary, physiological disorder.<ref name=":8" /> He believed hysteria impaired areas of the brain which provoked the physical symptoms displayed in each patient.<ref name=":8" /> While Charcot believed hysteria was hereditary, he also thought that environmental factors such as stress could trigger hysteria in an individual.<ref></ref>
Charcot published over 120 case studies of patients who he diagnosed with hysteria, including Marie "Blanche" Whittman.<ref name=":3"></ref> Whittman was referred to as the "Queen of Hysterics," and remains the most famous patient of hysteria.<ref name=":3" /> To treat his patients, Charcot used hypnosis, which he determined was only successful when used on hysterics.<ref name=":3" /> Using patients as props, Charcot executed dramatic public demonstrations of hysterical patients and his cures for hysteria, which many suggest produced the hysterical phenomenon.<ref name=":3" /> Furthermore, Charcot noted similarities between demon possession and hysteria, and thus, he concluded "demonomania" was a form of hysteria.<ref name=":4" />
=== Sigmund Freud ===
In 1896, Sigmund Freud, who was an Austrian psychiatrist, published "The Aetiology of Hysteria".<ref name=":1"></ref> The paper explains how Freud believes his female patients' neurosis, which he labels hysteria, resulted from sexual abuse as children.<ref name=":1" /> Freud named the concept of physical symptoms resulting from childhood trauma: hysterical conversion.<ref name=":1" /> Freud hypothesized that in order to cure hysteria the patient must relive the experiences through imagination in the most vivid form while under light hypnosis.<ref name=":1" /> However, Freud later changed his theory.<ref name=":1" /> His new theory claimed that his patients imagined the instances of sexual abuse, which were instead repressed childhood fantasies.<ref name=":1" /> By 1905, Freud retracted the theory of hysteria resulting from repressed childhood fantasies. Freud was also one of the first noted psychiatrist to attribute hysteria to men.<ref name=":2" /> He diagnosed himself with hysteria--writing he feared his work exacerbated his condition.<ref name=":2" />
== Modern perceptions ==
For the most part, hysteria does not exist as a medical diagnosis in Western culture and has been replaced by other diagnoses such as conversion or functional disorders.<ref></ref> The term hysterical, applied to an individual, can mean that they are emotional, irrationally upset, or frenzied.<ref name=":11"></ref> When applied to a situation that does not involve panic, hysteria means that situation is uncontrollably amusing (the connotation being that it invokes hysterical laughter).<ref name=":11" /> Hysteria can also impact groups, medically and colloquially referred to as mass hysteria or mass psychogenic illness.<ref name=":0" /> Instances of mass hysteria have been recorded throughout history and continue to occur today.<ref name=":0" />
