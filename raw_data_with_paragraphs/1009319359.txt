Monarch butterfly

== Genome ==
The monarch was the first butterfly to have its genome sequenced.<ref name="Xerces Society"/> The 273-million base pair draft sequence includes a set of 16,866 protein-coding genes. The genome provides researchers insights into migratory behavior, the circadian clock, juvenile hormone pathways and microRNAs that are differentially expressed between summer and migratory monarchs.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> More recently, the genetic basis of monarch migration and warning coloration has been described.<ref name=Zhan></ref>
There is no genetic differentiation between the migratory populations of eastern and western North America.<ref name="Xerces Society"/> Recent research has identified the specific areas in the genome of the monarch that regulate migration. There appears to be no genetic difference between a migrating and nonmigrating monarch but the gene is expressed in migrating monarchs but not expressed in nonmigrating monarchs.<ref name="Jeffrey L 2011"/>
== Conservation status ==
The monarch butterfly is not currently listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) or protected specifically under U.S. domestic laws.<ref name="fws.gov"/> On 14 August 2014, the Center for Biological Diversity and the Center for Food Safety filed a legal petition requesting Endangered Species Act protection for the monarch and its habitat,<ref name="Xerces Society"/> based largely on the long-term trends observed at overwintering sites. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) initiated a status review of the monarch butterfly under the Endangered Species Act with a due date for information submission of 3 March 2015, later extended to 2020. On December 15, 2020, the FWS ruled that adding the butterfly to the list of threatened and endangered species was “warranted-but-precluded” because it needed to devote its resources to 161 higher-priority species.<ref></ref> 
The number of monarchs overwintering in Mexico has shown a long-term downward trend. Since 1995, coverage numbers have been as high as during the winter of 1996–1997, but on average about . Coverage declined to its lowest point to date during the winter of 2013–2014, but rebounded to in 2015–2016. The average population of monarchs in 2016 was estimated at 200&nbsp;million. Historically, on average there are 300&nbsp;million monarchs. The 2016 increase was attributed to favorable breeding conditions in the summer of 2015. However, coverage declined by 27% to during the winter of 2016–2017. Some believe this was because of a storm that had occurred during March 2016 in the monarchs' previous overwintering season,<ref>(1) <br/>(2) <br/>(3) </ref> though this seems unlikely since most current research shows that the overwintering colony sizes do not predict the size of the next summer breeding population.<ref></ref>
A study in 2016 claimed that the long-term trend in the size of the overwintering sites is cause for concern. After a ten-fold drop in the overwintering numbers of the eastern monarch butterfly population over the last decade, this study claimed there was an 11%–57% probability that this population will go quasi-extinct over the next 20 years.<ref name=Semmens></ref> According to Xerces Society, the monarch population in California decreased 86 percent in 2018, going from millions of butterflies to tens of thousands of butterflies.<ref></ref> In Xerces annual winter count of 2021 a significant decline in the California population. One Pacific Grove site did not have a single monarch butterfly. The primary explanation for this is the destruction of the butterfly's milkweed habitats.<ref></ref>
In Ontario, Canada, the monarch butterfly is listed as a species of special concern.<ref name="Monarch Butterfly Status in Ontario"/> In fall 2016, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada proposed that the monarch be listed as endangered in Canada, as opposed to its current listing as a "species of concern" in that country. This move, once enacted, would protect critical monarch habitat in Canada, such as major fall accumulation areas in southern Ontario, but it would also have implications for citizen scientists who work with monarchs, and for classroom activities. If the monarch were federally protected in Canada, these activities could be limited, or require federal permits.<ref></ref> In Nova Scotia, the monarch is listed as endangered at the provincial level, as of 2017. This decision (as well as the Ontario decision) appears to be because of the presumption that the overwintering colony declines in Mexico translate into declines in the breeding range in Canada.<ref></ref> Two recent studies have been conducted examining long-term trends in monarch abundance in Canada, using either butterfly atlas records<ref></ref> or citizen science butterfly surveys,<ref></ref> and neither shows evidence of a population decline in Canada. 
== Threats ==
There is increasing concern related to the ongoing decline of monarchs at their overwintering sites; based on a 2014 twenty-year comparison, the overwintering numbers west of the Rocky Mountains have dropped more than 50 percent since 1997 and the overwintering numbers east of the Rockies have declined by more than 90 percent since 1995.<ref name="Xerces Society"/>
In February 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service provided a statistic showing that nearly a billion monarchs have vanished from the overwintering sites since 1990. At that time, one of the main reasons cited was the herbicides used by farmers and homeowners on milkweed, a plant used as a food source, a home and a nursery by the monarchs.<ref></ref> A 2016 study also attributed the last decade's ten-fold decline in overwintering numbers of the eastern monarch population to the loss of breeding habitat, namely the many species of milkweed (Asclepias species) that developing larvae require for food; however, scientists believe there are other factors as well. A number of researchers believe milkweed loss during the breeding season is the cause because declines in milkweed abundance are highly correlated with the adoption of herbicide-tolerant genetically modified corn and soybeans, which now constitute 89% and 94% of these crops, respectively, in the U.S.<ref name=Semmens/> However, correlative evidence does not prove causation, and other possible causes of the overwintering declines have been proposed. A 2018 study has suggested that the decline in milkweed predates the arrival of GM crops.<ref></ref>
=== Habitat loss due to herbicide use ===
A number of conservationists attribute the disappearance of Asclepias to agricultural practices in the Midwest, where Genetically modified crops are bred to resist herbicides that eliminate milkweed nearby. Growers eliminate milkweed that previously grew between the rows of food crops. Corn and soybeans are resistant to the effect of the herbicide glyphosate. The increased use of these crop strains is correlated with the decline in monarch populations between 1999 and 2010.<ref></ref><ref name="Brennen"></ref>
Chip Taylor, director of Monarch Watch at the University of Kansas, said the Midwest milkweed habitat "is virtually gone" with 120–150&nbsp;million acres lost.<ref name=yale></ref><ref name="Wines">Wines, Michael (13 March 2013) urltoken Monarch Migration Plunges to Lowest Level in Decades. The New York Times</ref> To help fight this problem, Monarch Watch encourages the planting of "Monarch Waystations".<ref name=watch/> The Natural Resources Defense Council filed a suit in 2015 against the EPA, in which it is argued that the agency ignored warnings about the dangers of glyphosate usage for monarchs.<ref></ref>
=== Losses during migration ===
While herbicide-use has been proposed as one factor causing the decline in overwintering numbers of eastern monarchs, it is not the only possibility. Another is that the monarchs are experiencing problems reaching Mexico. This idea has been embraced by a number of leading monarch researchers, largely because of recent evidence showing that the number of breeding (adult) monarchs has not declined in the last two decades, based on long-term citizen science data.<ref name="Ries 2015"></ref><ref name="Inamine 2016"></ref><ref name="ReferenceA"></ref> The lack of long-term declines in the numbers of breeding, and migratory monarchs, yet the clear declines in overwintering numbers, implies there is a disconnect between these life stages, that must be growing. One expert has proposed that a large and growing threat to migrating monarchs is mortality from car strikes.<ref name="monarchscience"></ref> A study of road mortality in northern Mexico, published in 2019, showed very high mortality from just two "hotspots" each year, amounting to 200,000 monarchs killed.<ref></ref>
=== Parasites ===
Parasites include the tachinid flies Sturmia convergens<ref></ref> and Lespesia archippivora. Lesperia-parasitized butterfly larvae suspend, but die prior to pupation. The fly's maggot lowers itself to the ground, forms a brown puparium and then emerges as an adult.<ref name = Brewer></ref>
Monarch chrysalises are parasitized by Pteromalidae, specifically Pteromalus cassotis.<ref name="pteromalidae"></ref> These wasps lay their eggs in the pupae while the chrysalis is still soft. Up to 400 adults emerge from the chrysalis after 14–20 days,<ref name="pteromalidae" /> killing the monarch.
The bacterium Micrococcus flacidifex danai also infects larvae. Just before pupation, the larvae migrate to a horizontal surface and die a few hours later, attached only by one pair of prolegs, with the thorax and abdomen hanging limp. The body turns black shortly after. The bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa has no invasive powers, but causes secondary infections in weakened insects. It is a common cause of death in laboratory-reared insects.<ref name = Brewer/>
The protozoan Ophryocystis elektroscirrha is another parasite of the monarch. It infects the subcutaneous tissues and propagates by spores formed during the pupal stage. The spores are found over all of the body of infected butterflies, with the greatest number on the abdomen. These spores are passed, from vertical transmission, when spores rub off during egg laying and are then ingested by caterpillars. Severely infected individuals are weak, unable to expand their wings, or unable to eclose, and have shortened lifespans, but parasite levels vary in populations. This is not the case in laboratory rearing, where after a few generations, all individuals can be infected.<ref></ref> Infection with this parasite creates an effect known as culling whereby migrating monarchs that are infected are less likely to complete the migration. This results in overwintering populations with lower parasite loads.<ref name="Bartel Ober"></ref> Owners of commercial butterfly breeding operations claim that they take steps to control this parasite in their practices,<ref>
</ref> although this claim is doubted by many scientists who study monarchs.<ref></ref>
=== Confusion of host plants ===
The black swallow-wort (Cynanchum louiseae) and pale swallow-wort (Cynanchum rossicum) plants are problematic for monarchs in North America. Monarchs lay their eggs on these relatives of native vining milkweed (Cynanchum laeve) because they produce stimuli similar to milkweed. Once the eggs hatch, the caterpillars are poisoned by the toxicity of this invasive plant from Europe.<ref> urltoken Invasive species alert: Black swallow-wort (Cynanchum louisea) and pale swallow-wort (Cynanchum rossicum). monarchjointventure.org]</ref>
=== Loss of overwintering habitat ===
The area of forest occupied has been declining and reached its lowest level in two decades in 2013. The decline is continuing but is expected to increase during the 2013–2014 season. Mexican environmental authorities continue to monitor illegal logging of the oyamel trees. The oyamel is a major species of evergreen on which the overwintering butterflies spend a significant time during their winter diapause, or suspended development.<ref>Paz, Fátima (18 June 2014) urltoken En espera de aprobación de la Profepa por tala ilegal en la Reserva de la Mariposa Monarca. cambiodemichoacan.com.mx</ref>
A 2014 study acknowledged that while "the protection of overwintering habitat has no doubt gone a long way towards conserving monarchs that breed throughout eastern North America", their research indicates that habitat loss on breeding grounds in the United States is the main cause of both recent and projected population declines.<ref name="University of Guelph"></ref>
=== Climate ===
Climate variations during the fall and summer affect butterfly reproduction. Rainfall, and freezing temperatures affect milkweed growth. Omar Vidal, director general of WWF-Mexico, said "The monarch's lifecycle depends on the climatic conditions in the places where they breed. Eggs, larvae and pupae develop more quickly in milder conditions. Temperatures above 35°C (95°F) can be lethal for larvae, and eggs dry out in hot, arid conditions, causing a drastic decrease in hatch rate."<ref> urltoken Monarch Population Hits Lowest Point in More Than 20 Years. WWF (29 January 2014)</ref> If a monarch's body temperatures is below 30°C (86°F) a monarch cannot fly. To warm up they will sit in the sun or rapidly shiver their wings to warm themselves.<ref></ref>
There is concern that climate change will dramatically affect the monarch migration. A study from 2015 examined the impact of warming temperatures on the breeding range of the monarch, and showed that in the next 50 years the monarch host plant will expand its range further north into Canada, and that the monarchs will follow this.<ref>
</ref> While this will expand the breeding locations of the monarch, this will also have the effect of increasing the distance that monarchs must travel to reach their overwintering destination in Mexico, and this could result in greater mortality during the migration.<ref></ref>
Milkweeds grown at increased temperatures have been shown to contain higher cardenolide concentrations making the leaves too toxic for the monarch caterpillars, but these increased concentrations are likely in response to increased insect herbivory which is also caused by the increased temperatures, so it is unknown whether increased temperatures in isolation will make milkweed too toxic for monarch caterpillars.<ref></ref> Additionally, milkweed grown at carbon dioxide levels of 760 parts per million (ppm) plants were found to produce a different mix of the toxic cardenolides, one that was less effective against monarch parasites.<ref name="Climate change, pesticides put monarch butterflies at risk of extinction"></ref>
== Conservation efforts ==
Although numbers of breeding monarchs in eastern North America have apparently not decreased, reports of declining numbers of overwintering butterflies have inspired efforts to conserve the species.<ref name="Ries 2015"/><ref name="Inamine 2016"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/> Because of concerns over the overwintering numbers, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Center for Food Safety, the Xerces Society and Lincoln Brower have filed a petition to the United States Department of the Interior to protect the monarch by having it federally protected.<ref name="Xerces Society"/>
On 20 June 2014, President Barack Obama issued a presidential memorandum entitled "Creating a Federal Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators". The memorandum established a Pollinator Health Task Force, to be co-chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and stated:<blockquote>The number of migrating Monarch butterflies sank to the lowest recorded population level in 2013–14, and there is an imminent risk of failed migration.<ref></ref></blockquote>
In May 2015, the Pollinator Health Task Force issued a "National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators". The strategy lays out current and planned federal actions to achieve three goals, two of which are:<blockquote>• Monarch Butterflies: Increase the Eastern population of the monarch butterfly to 225 million butterflies occupying an area of approximately 15 acres (6 hectares) in the overwintering grounds in Mexico, through domestic/international actions and public-private partnerships, by 2020.<br />• Pollinator Habitat Acreage: Restore or enhance 7 million acres of land for pollinators over the next 5 years through Federal actions and public/private partnerships.</blockquote>
Many of the priority projects that the national strategy identifies will focus on the I-35 corridor extending for from Texas to Minnesota that provides spring and summer breeding habitats in the monarch's key migration corridor.<ref></ref>
There have been a number of national and local efforts underway to establish pollinator habitat along highways and roadways, although this effort is controversial. Conservationists are lobbying transportation departments and utilities to reduce their use of herbicides and specifically encourage milkweed to grow along roadways and power lines. Reducing roadside mowing and application of herbicides during the butterfly breeding season will encourage milkweed growth.<ref></ref> Conservationists lobby agriculture companies to set aside areas that remain unsprayed to allow the butterflies to breed.<ref name="Brennen"/> This practice is controversial because of the high risk of butterfly mortality near roads, as several studies have shown that millions of monarchs and other butterflies are killed by cars every year.<ref name="monarchscience"/> There is also evidence that monarch larvae living near roads experience physiological stress conditions, as evidenced by elevations in their heart rate.<ref></ref>
A 2020 resource from the Cooperative Research Programs of the Transportation Research Board developed products for roadway corridors to provide habitat for monarch butterflies and developed tools for roadside managers to optimize potential habitat for monarch butterflies in their road right-of-ways.<ref></ref>
===Butterfly gardening===
While there are few scientific studies on the subject, the practice of butterfly gardening and creating "Monarch Waystations" is commonly thought to increase the populations of butterflies.<ref>(1) <br/>(2) <br/>(3) <br/>(4) <br>(5) <br />(6) .</ref> Efforts to increase monarch populations by establishing butterfly gardens and waystations require particular attention to the butterfly's food preferences and population cycles, as well to the conditions needed to propagate milkweed.
For example, in the Washington, D.C. area and elsewhere in the northeastern United States, monarchs prefer to reproduce on common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), especially when its foliage is soft and fresh. Because monarch reproduction in that area peaks in late summer when milkweed foliage is old and tough, A. syriaca needs to be cut back in June through August to assure that it will be regrowing rapidly when monarch reproduction reaches its peak.<ref name="Monarch Joint Venture"/><ref>(1) .<br />(2) .<br />(3) .<br />(4) .<br />(5) .</ref> In addition, milkweed seed may need a period of cold treatment (cold stratification) before it will germinate.<ref>(1) .<br />(2) .<br />(3) .<br />(4) .</ref>
Although monarch caterpillars will feed on butterfly weed (Asclepias tuberosa) in butterfly gardens, the plant has rough leaves and is typically not a heavily used host plant. The plant is therefore less suitable for use in butterfly gardens and monarch waystations than are other milkweed species.<ref> .</ref> In addition, the plant's lack of cardiac glycosides may also make the plant unattractive to egg-laying monarchs.<ref name=Abugattas/>

The monarch butterfly or simply monarch (Danaus plexippus) is a milkweed butterfly (subfamily Danainae) in the family Nymphalidae.<ref name=":0"></ref> Other common names, depending on region, include milkweed, common tiger, wanderer, and black veined brown.<ref name="nic.funet.fi"/> It may be the most familiar North American butterfly, and is considered an iconic pollinator species.<ref></ref> Its wings feature an easily recognizable black, orange, and white pattern, with a wingspan of </ref>
An unpublished study in 2019 compared behavior of captive-reared versus wild monarch larvae.<ref></ref> The study showed that reared larvae exhibited more defensive behavior than wild larvae. The reason for this is unknown, but it could relate to the fact that reared larvae are frequently handled and/or disturbed.
