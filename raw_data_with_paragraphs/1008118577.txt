Romanowsky stain

==Mechanism==
The value of Romanowsky staining lies in its ability to produce a wide range of hues, allowing cellular components to be easily differentiated. This phenomenon is referred to as the Romanowsky effect, or more generally as metachromasia.<ref name="Ribatti2018"/>
===Romanowsky effect===
In 1891 Romanowsky<ref name="Романовскiй1890" /><ref name="Романовскiй1891" /><ref name="Romanowsky1891" /> developed a stain using a mixture of eosin (typically eosin Y) and aged solutions of methylene blue that formed hues unattributable to the staining components alone: distinctive shades of purple in the chromatin of the cell nucleus and within granules in the cytoplasm of some white blood cells. This became known as the Romanowsky or Romanowsky-Giemsa effect.<ref name="Horobin1987" /><ref name="Woronzoff2002" /><ref name="Bezrukov, 2017" /><ref name="Wittekind, 1983" /><ref name="Marshall, 1978" /> Eosin and pure methylene blue alone (or in combination) do not produce the Romanowsky effect,<ref name="Wittekind, 1983" /><ref name="Marshall, 1978" /> and the active stains which produce the effect are now considered to be azure B and eosin.<ref name="Cooksey, 2017" /><ref name="Horobin, 2011" /><ref name="Wittekind, 1983" />
===Polychromed methylene blue===
Romanowsky-type stains can be made from either a combination of pure dyes, or from methylene blue that has been subject to oxidative demethylation, which results in the breakdown of methylene blue into multiple other stains, some of which are necessary to produce the Romanowsky effect.<ref name="Lillie, 1977" /><ref name="Marshall, 1978" /> Methylene blue that has that has undergone this oxidative process is known as "polychromed methylene blue".<ref name="Lillie, 1977" /><ref name="Marshall, 1978" /> Polychromed methylene blue may contain up to 11 dyes, including methylene blue, azure A, azure B, azure C, thionine, methylene violet Bernthesen, methyl thionoline and thionoline.<ref name="Marshall, 1978" /> The exact composition of polychromed methylene blue depends on the method used, and even batches of the stain from the same manufacturer may vary in composition.<ref name="Lillie, 1977" />
Although azure B and eosin have been shown to be the required components to produce the Romanowsky effect,<ref name="Cooksey, 2017" /><ref name="Horobin, 2011" /><ref name="Wittekind, 1983" /> these stains in their pure forms have not always been used in the formulation of the staining solutions.<ref name="Marshall, 1978" /> The original sources of azure B (one of the oxidation products of methylene blue) were from polychromed methylene blue solutions, which were treated with oxidizing agents or allowed to naturally age in the case of Romanowsky.<ref name="Horobin, 2011" /><ref name="Wittekind, 1983" /> Ernst Malachowsky in 1891 was the first to purposely polychrome methylene blue for use in a Romanowsky-type stain.<ref name="Lillie, 1977" /><ref name="Lillie, 1978" />
==Types==
===May-Grünwald-Giemsa===
The May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain is a two step procedure that includes first staining with May-Grünwald stain, which does not produce the Romanowsky effect, followed by staining the Giemsa stain which does produce the Romanowsky effect.<ref name="Paiton et al., 2016" />
===Wright's and Wright-Giemsa stains===
Wright's stain can be used alone or in combination with the Giemsa stain, which is known as the Wright-Giemsa stain.<ref name="Theil, 2012" /> Wright's stain is named after James Homer Wright who in 1902<ref name="Wright1902" /> published a method using heat to produce polychromed methylene blue, which is combined with eosin Y.<ref name="Krafts et al., 2011" /><ref name="Gatenby and Beams, 1950" /><ref name="Woronzoff-Dashkoff 2002" /><ref name="Theil, 2012" /> The polychromed methylene blue is combined with eosin and allowed to precipitate, forming an eosinate which is redissolved in methanol.<ref name="Marshall, 1978" /> The addition of Giemsa to Wright's stain increases the brightness of the "reddish-purple" color of the cytoplasmic granules.<ref name="Theil, 2012" /><ref name="Woronzoff-Dashkoff 2002" /> The Wright's and Wright-Giemsa stains are two of the Romanowsky-type stains in common use in the United States and are mainly used for the staining of blood and bone marrow films.<ref name="Woronzoff-Dashkoff 2002" /><ref name="Theil, 2012" />
===Leishman stain===
In 1901 William Leishman<ref name="Leishman1901" /> developed a stain that was similar to Louis Jenner's but with the replacement of pure methylene blue with polychromed methylene blue.<ref name="Krafts et al., 2011" /><ref name="Lillie, 1977" /><ref name="Marshall, 1978" /> Leishman's stain is prepared from the eosinate of polychromed methylene blue and eosin Y using methanol as the solvent.<ref name="Marshall, 1978" />
===Giemsa stain===
Giemsa stain is composed of "Azure II" and eosin Y with methanol and glycerol as the solvent.<ref name="Lillie, 1977" /> "Azure II" is thought to be a mixture of azure B (which Giemsa called "azure I") and methylene blue, although the exact composition of "azure I" is considered a trade secret.<ref name="Marshall, 1978" /><ref name="Lillie, 1977" />Comparable formulations using known dyes have been published and are commercially available. Giemsa stain is considered to be the standard stain for detection and identification of the malaria parasite.<ref name="Li, et al., 2012" />
==Clinical importances==
===Blood and bone marrow pathology===
Romanowsky-type stains are widely used in the examination of blood, in the form of blood films, and in the microscopic Bone marrow examination biopsies and aspirate smears.<ref name="Theil, 2012" /><ref name="Peterson et al., 2012" /> Examination of both blood and bone marrow can be of importance in the diagnosis of a variety of blood diseases.<ref name="Theil, 2012" /><ref name="Peterson et al., 2012" /> In the United States the Wright and Wright-Giemsa variants of the Romanowsky-type stains are widely used,<ref name="Theil, 2012" /> while in Europe Giemsa stain is commonly employed.<ref name="Theil, 2012" />
===Detection of malaria and other parasites===
Of the Romanowsky-type stains, the Giemsa stain is especially important in Diagnosis of malaria.<ref name="Li, et al., 2012" /><ref name="Lillie, 1977" /> Malaria antigen detection tests are an alternative to the staining and microscopic examination of blood films for the detection of malaria.<ref name="Li, et al., 2012" />
===Use in cytopathology===
Romanowsky-type stains are also used for the staining of cytopathology specimens such as those produced from fine-needle aspirates and cerebrospinal fluid from Lumbar puncture.<ref name="Krafts and Pambuccian, 2011" />
==History==
Although debate exists as to who deserves credit for this general staining method, popular usage has attributed it to Dmitri Leonidovich Romanowsky.<ref name="Cooksey, 2017" /><ref name="Lillie, 1978" /><ref name="Krafts et al., 2011" />
In the 1870s Paul Ehrlich used a mixture of acidic and basic dyes including acid fuchsin (acid dye) and methylene blue (basic dye) to examine blood films.<ref name="Ehrlich1880" /><ref name="Bracegirdle 1986" /><ref name="Krafts et al., 2011-malarial parasite" /><ref name="Woronzoff-Dashkoff, 1993" /><ref name="Lillie, 1978" /> In 1888 Cheslav Ivanovich Chenzinsky used methylene blue, but substituted the acid fuchsin used by Ehrlich with eosin.<ref name="Cooksey, 2017" /><ref name="Krafts et al., 2011-malarial parasite" /><ref name="Woronzoff-Dashkoff, 1993" /> Chenzinsky's stain combination was able to stain the malaria parasite (a member of the genus Plasmodium).<ref name="Woronzoff-Dashkoff, 1993" /><ref name="Krafts et al., 2011" /> Neither Ehrlich's or Chenzinsky's stains produced the Romanowsky effect as the methylene blue they used was not polychromed.<ref name="Lillie, 1978" />
Dmitri Romanowsky in 1890 published preliminary findings of his blood stain (a combination of aged methylene blue and eosin), including the results when applied to malaria infected blood.<ref name="Bezrukov, 2017" /> This use of polychromed methylene blue differentiated Romanowsky's stain (and the subsequent formulations) from those of Ehrlich and Chenzinsky, which lacked the purple hue associated with the Romanowsky effect.<ref name="Lillie, 1978" /> Romanowsky's 1890 publication did not include a description of how he modified his methylene blue solution,<ref name="Bezrukov, 2017" /><ref name="Lillie, 1978" /> but in his 1891 doctoral thesis he described methylene blue best as used after mold began forming on the surface.<ref name="Bezrukov, 2017" /><ref name="Lillie, 1978" /> Other than the use of an aged methylene blue solution, Romanowsky's stain was based on Chenzinsky's stain technique.<ref name="Lillie, 1978" /> Romanowsky's use of his method to study the malaria patasite has been attributed to the continued interest in his staining method.<ref name="Bracegirdle 1986" />
Ernst Malachowsky has been credited with independently observing the same stain combination as Dmitri Romanowsky in 1891,<ref name="Bezrukov, 2017" /><ref name="Wittekind, 1983" /> although he has also been credited with being the first to do so.<ref name="Lillie, 1978" /><ref name="Krafts et al., 2011" /> Malachowsky was the first to use a deliberately polychromed methylene blue solution,<ref name="Lillie, 1977" /> which Malachowsky accomplished by the addition of borax to the staining mixture.<ref name="Lillie, 1978" /> Malachowsky is reported to have demonstrated the stain on June 15, 1890, and in the same year to have published a paper "describing his public demonstration".<ref name="Krafts et al., 2011" /> Both the Romanowsky and Malachowsky methods were able to stain the nucleus and cytoplasm of the malaria parasite, when until this point the stains used had only colored the cytoplasm.<ref name="Krafts et al., 2011" />
In 1899, Louis Leopold Jenner developed a more stable version of the methylene blue and eosin stain by collecting the precipitate that forms in water-based mixtures and redissolving it in methanol.<ref name="Woronzoff-Dashkoff, 1993" /><ref name="Lillie, 1977" /><ref name="Marshall, 1978" /> Romanowsky-type stains prepared from the collected precipitates are sometimes known as eosinates.<ref name="Marshall, 1978" /> Besides increasing the stability of the stain, the use of methanol in Jenner's stain had the effect of fixing the blood samples,<ref name="Marshall, 1978" /> although Jenner's version of the stain does not produce the Romanowsky effect.<ref name="Woronzoff-Dashkoff, 1993" /><ref name="Krafts et al., 2011" /><ref name="Lillie, 1977" />
Richard May and Ludwig Grünwald in 1892 published a version of the stain (now known as the May–Grünwald stain) which is similar to the version proposed by Jenner in 1899, and likewise does not produce the Romanowsky effect.<ref name="Woronzoff-Dashkoff, 1993" /><ref name="Krafts et al., 2011" /><ref name="Lillie, 1977" />
In 1901, both Karl Reuter and William Leishman<ref name="Leishman1901" /> developed stains that combined Louis Jenner's use of alcohol as the solvent and Malachowsky's use of polychromed methylene blue.<ref name="Krafts et al., 2011" /><ref name="Lillie, 1977" /><ref name="Marshall, 1978" /> Reuter's stain differed from Jenner's in using ethyl alcohol instead of methanol, and Leishman's differed from Jenner's by using eosin B instead of eosin Y.<ref name="Krafts et al., 2011" /><ref name="Marshall, 1978" />
James Homer Wright in 1902 published<ref name="Wright1902" /> a method using heat to polychrome the methylene blue, which he combined with eosin Y. This technique is known as Wright's stain.<ref name="Krafts et al., 2011" /><ref name="Gatenby and Beams, 1950" />
Gustav Giemsa name has also become associated with the stain as he is credited with publishing a useful formulation and protocol in 1902.<ref name="Wittekind, 1983" /><ref name="Bezrukov, 2017" /><ref name="Bracegirdle 1986" /> Giemsa attempted to use combinations of pure dyes rather than polychromed methylene blue solutions which are highly variable in composition.<ref name="Gatenby and Beams, 1950" /><ref name="Krafts et al., 2011" /><ref name="Lillie, 1977" /> Giemsa sold the rights to produce his stain, but never fully published details on how he produced it,<ref name="Krafts et al., 2011" /> although it is thought that he used a combination of azure B and methylene blue.<ref name="Lillie, 1977" /> Giemsa published a number of modifications of his stains between 1902 and 1934. In 1904<ref name="Giemsa1904" /> he suggested adding glycerin to his stain, along with the methanol, to increase its stability.<ref name="Peterson et al., 2012" /><ref name="Krafts et al., 2011" />
Giemsa stain powders produced in Germany were widely used in the United States until the interruption of the supply during World War I, which caused increased utilization of James Homer Wright's method for polychroming methylene blue.<ref name="Krafts et al., 2011" /><ref name="Theil, 2012" />

Romanowsky staining, also known as Romanowsky–Giemsa staining, is a prototypical staining technique that was the forerunner of several distinct but similar stains widely used in hematology (the study of blood) and cytopathology (the study of diseased cells). Romanowsky-type stains are used to differentiate cells for microscopic examination in pathology specimens, especially blood and bone marrow films,<ref name="Theil, 2012" /> and to detect parasites such as malaria within the blood.<ref name="BainBates2016" /><ref name="Horobin, 2011" /><ref name="Marshall, 1978" /><ref name="Li, et al., 2012" /> Stains that are related to or derived from the Romanowsky-type stains include Giemsa, Jenner, Wright, Field, May–Grünwald and Leishman stains. The staining technique is named after the Russian physician Dmitri Leonidovich Romanowsky (1861&ndash;1921), who was one of the first to recognize its potential for use as a blood stain.<ref name="Bezrukov, 2017" />
