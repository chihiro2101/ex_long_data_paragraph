In late 1991, two compilation albums were released: Looking for Freedom and For You, with the former album including hits from 1989 and 1990, and the latter including hits from 1985 to 1987; however, both albums failed to chart.

The concert was expected to help his singing career in the United States. However, on the night of the concert, O. J. Simpson was involved in his slow-speed chase in southern California. Viewership of the concert was significantly lower than expected due to the live coverage of the chase, and the event was ultimately a $1.5&nbsp;million loss.<ref></ref> Hasselhoff joked that "90 million people watched O. J. and three people watched me, including me and my mom and my dad".<ref name="access20160318"></ref> Following this, Hasselhoff released his eighth studio album Du, which became Hasselhoff's first studio album not to receive any certification in Europe, and also met with moderate success on European charts.
