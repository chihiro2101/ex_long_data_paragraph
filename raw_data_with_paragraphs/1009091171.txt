Christopher Hill (historian)

==Early life==
Christopher Hill was born on 6 February 1912, Bishopthorpe Road, York, to Edward Harold Hill and Janet Augusta (née Dickinson). His father was a solicitor and the family were devout Methodists. He attended St Peter's School, York.<ref name="Oxford DNB"></ref> At the age of 16, he sat his entrance examination at Balliol College, Oxford. The two history tutors who marked his papers recognised his ability and offered him a place in order to forestall any chance he might go to the University of Cambridge.<ref name="Guardian obit"></ref> In 1931 Hill took a prolonged holiday in Freiburg, Germany, where he witnessed the rise of the Nazi Party, later saying that it contributed significantly to the radicalisation of his politics.
He matriculated at Balliol College in 1931. In the following year he won the Lothian Prize,<ref name="Guardian obit" /> and he graduated with a first-class Bachelor of Arts degree in modern history in 1934. Whilst at Balliol, Hill became a committed Marxist and joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in the year he graduated.<ref name="Oxford DNB" />
==Early academic career==
After graduating, he became a fellow of All Souls College. In 1935, he undertook a ten-month trip to Moscow, Soviet Union. There he became fluent in Russian and studied Soviet historical scholarship, particularly that relating to Britain.<ref name="Oxford DNB" /> After returning to England in 1936, Hill accepted a teaching position as an Lecturer at the Cardiff University. During his time at Cardiff, Hill attempted to join the International Brigade and fight in the Spanish Civil War but was rejected.<ref name="Guardian obit" /> Instead, he was active in helping Basque refugees, displaced by the war.<ref name="Oxford DNB" /> After two years at Cardiff, he returned to Balliol College in 1938 as a fellow and tutor of history.<ref name="Oxford DNB" />
==War service==
Following the outbreak of the Second World War, he joined the British Army, initially as a private in the Royal Military Police.<ref></ref> He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry on 2 November 1940 with the service number 156590.<ref name="LG 15 November 1940"></ref> That same year, he took part in a debate among many Marxist historians. At around this time, Hill started to publish his articles and reviews about 17th-century English history. On 19 October 1941, he transferred to the Intelligence Corps.<ref name="LG 25 November 1941"></ref> He was seconded to the Foreign Office from 1943 until the war ended.<ref name="Guardian obit" />
==Later academic career and politics==
Hill returned to Oxford University after the war to continue his academic work. In 1946, he and many other Marxist historians formed the Communist Party Historians Group. In 1949, he applied to be the chair of History at the newly created Keele University, but was turned down because of his Communist Party affiliations.<ref name="Oxford DNB" /> He helped create the journal Past and Present in 1952, that focused on social history.<ref name="Oxford DNB" />
Hill was becoming discontented with the lack of democracy in the Communist Party.<ref name="Guardian obit" /> However, he stayed in the party, unlike many other intellectuals, after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. He finally left the party in the spring of 1957 when one of his reports to the party congress was rejected.<ref name="Oxford DNB" />
After 1956, Hill's career ascended to new heights. His studies on 17th-century English history were widely acknowledged and recognised. It was also the year of the publication of his first academic book; Economic Problems of the Church from Archbishop Whitgift to the Long Parliament.<ref name="Oxford DNB" /> These were based on the study of printed sources accessible in the Bodleian Library and on the secondary works produced by other academic historians rather than on research in the surviving archives. In 1965, Hill was elected the Master (college).<ref name="Oxford DNB" /> He held the post from 1965 to 1978, when he retired (he was replaced by Anthony Kenny). Among his students at Balliol was Brian Manning, who went on to develop understanding of the English Revolution. At Oxford, he acted as Senior Member of the exclusive Stubbs Society.
Many of Hill's most notable studies focused on 17th-century English history. His books include Puritanism and Revolution (1958), Intellectual Origins of the English Revolution (1965 and revised in 1996), The Century of Revolution (1961), AntiChrist in 17th-century England (1971), The World Turned Upside Down (1972) and many others.
He retired from Balliol in 1978 when he took up a full-time appointment for two years at the Open University. He continued to lecture thereafter from his home at Sibford Ferris, Oxfordshire.
In Hill's later years, he lived with Alzheimer's disease and required constant care.<ref name="Bridget Oxford DNB" /> He died on 23 February 2003 of cerebral atrophy in a nursing home in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire.<ref name="Oxford DNB" />
==Personal life==
Hill married Inez Waugh (née Bartlett) on 17 January 1944. The 23-year-old was the ex-wife of Ian Anthony Waugh and daughter of an army officer, Gordon Bartlett. Together they had a daughter, Fanny, who drowned while holidaying in Spain in 1986. Their marriage broke down after ten years.<ref name="Oxford DNB" />
His second wife was Bridget Irene Mason (née Sutton),<ref name="Bridget Oxford DNB"></ref> the ex-wife of Stephen Mason, a fellow communist and historian. They married on 2 January 1956. Their first daughter Kate died in a car accident in 1957. They had two other children: Andrew (born 1958) and Dinah (born 1960).<ref name="Oxford DNB" />
