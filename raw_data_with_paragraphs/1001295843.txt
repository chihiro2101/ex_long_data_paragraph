*June – Australia's best-known literary hoax takes place when modernist magazine Angry Penguins publishes poems by a fictitious Ern Malley. The poets James McAuley and Harold Stewart have created the verses from lines of other published work and then submitted them as purportedly by a recently deceased poet. The hoax is on Max Harris, the 22-year-old avant garde poet, critic and founder of the magazine. Harris and his circle agree that an unknown modernist poet of great merit has come to light in suburban Australia. The Autumn 1944 edition with the poems comes out in mid-1945 due to wartime printing delays. An Australian newspaper reveals the hoax within weeks. McAuley and Stewart love early modernist poets, but despise later modernism, especially the well-funded Angry Penguins and Harris's precocious success.
