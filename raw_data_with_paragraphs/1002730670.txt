Bruxism

==Signs and symptoms==
Most people who brux are unaware of the problem, either because there are no symptoms, or because the symptoms are not understood to be associated with a clenching and grinding problem. The symptoms of sleep bruxism are usually most intense immediately after waking, and then slowly abate, and the symptoms of a grinding habit which occurs mainly while awake tend to worsen through the day, and may not be present on waking.<ref name="Scully 2008" /> Bruxism may cause a variety of signs and symptoms, including:
* Excessive tooth wear,<ref name="Heasman 2008" /> particularly attrition, which flattens the occlusal (biting) surface, but also possibly other types of tooth wear such as abfraction, where notches form around the neck of the teeth at the gumline.<ref name="Neville 2001"></ref>
* Tooth fractures,<ref name="Macedo 2009" /> and repeated failure of dental restorations (fillings, crowns, etc.).<ref name="Tyldesley 2003"></ref>
* Hypersensitive teeth,<ref name="Macedo 2009" /> (e.g. dental pain when drinking a cold liquid) caused by wearing away of the thickness of insulating layers of dentin and enamel around the dental pulp.
* Inflammation of the periodontal ligament of teeth, which may make them sore to bite on, and possibly also a degree of loosening of the teeth.<ref name="Macedo 2009" />
* A grinding or tapping noise during sleep, sometimes detected by a partner or a parent. Noises are rarely associated with awake bruxism.<ref name="Macedo 2009" />
* Other parafunctional activity which may occur together with bruxism:<ref name="Macedo 2009" /> cheek biting (which may manifest as morsicatio buccarum and/or linea alba),<ref name="Scully 2008" /><ref name="Heasman 2008" /> and/or lip biting.
* A burning sensation on the tongue (see: glossodynia),<ref name="Macedo 2009" /> possibly related to a coexistent "tongue thrusting" parafunctional activity.
* Indentations of the teeth in the tongue ("crenated tongue" or "scalloped tongue").<ref name="Heasman 2008" />
* Hypertrophy of the muscles of mastication (increase in the size of the muscles that move the jaw),<ref name="Heasman 2008"></ref> particularly the masseter muscle.<ref name="Macedo 2009" /><ref name="Scully 2008" /><ref name="Kalantzis 2005"></ref>
* Tenderness, pain or fatigue of the muscles of mastication,<ref name="Macedo 2009" /> which may get worse during chewing or other jaw movement.<ref name="Scully 2008" />
* Trismus (restricted mouth opening).<ref name="Macedo 2009" />
* Pain or tenderness of the temporomandibular joints,<ref name="Macedo 2009" /> which may manifest as preauricular pain (in front of the ear), or pain referred to the ear (otalgia).<ref name="medline plus"></ref>
* Clicking of the temporomandibular joints.<ref name="Shetty 2010" />
* Headaches, particularly pain in the temples,<ref name="Shetty 2010" /> caused by muscle pain associated with the temporalis muscle.
Bruxism is usually detected because of the effects of the process (most commonly tooth wear and pain), rather than the process itself. The large forces that can be generated during bruxism can have detrimental effects on the components of masticatory system, namely the teeth, the periodontium and the articulation of the mandible with the skull (the temporomandibular joints). The muscles of mastication that act to move the jaw can also be affected since they are being utilized over and above of normal function.<ref name="Wassell 2008" />
===Tooth wear===
Many publications list tooth wear as a consequence of bruxism, but some report a lack of a positive relationship between tooth wear and bruxism.<ref name="Shetty 2010" /> Tooth wear caused by tooth-to-tooth contact is termed attrition. This is the most usual type of tooth wear that occurs in bruxism, and affects the occlusal surface (the biting surface) of the teeth. The exact location and pattern of attrition depends on how the bruxism occurs, e.g., when the canines and incisors of the opposing arches are moved against each other laterally, by the action of the medial pterygoid muscles, this can lead to the wearing down of the incisal edges of the teeth. To grind the front teeth, most people need to posture their mandible forwards, unless there is an existing edge to edge, class III incisal relationship. People with bruxism may also grind their posterior teeth (back teeth), which wears down the cusps of the occlusal surface. Once tooth wear progresses through the enamel layer, the exposed dentin layer is softer and more vulnerable to wear and caries. If enough of the tooth is worn away or decayed, the tooth will effectively be weakened, and may fracture under the increased forces that occur in bruxism.
Abfraction is another type of tooth wear that is postulated to occur with bruxism, although some still argue whether this type of tooth wear is a reality.<ref name="Neville 2001" /> Abfraction cavities are said to occur usually on the facial aspect of teeth, in the cervical region as V-shaped defects caused by flexing of the tooth under occlusal forces. It is argued that similar lesions can be caused by long-term forceful toothbrushing. However, the fact that the cavities are V-shaped does not suggest that the damage is caused by toothbrush abrasion, and that some abfraction cavities occur below the level of the gumline, i.e., in an area shielded from toothbrush abrasion, supports the validity of this mechanism of tooth wear. In addition to attrition, erosion is said to synergistically contribute to tooth wear in some bruxists, according to some sources.<ref name="Pettengill 2011"></ref>
===Tooth mobility===
The view that occlusal trauma (as may occur during bruxism) is a causative factor in gingivitis and periodontitis is not widely accepted.<ref name="Davies 2001"></ref> It is thought that the periodontal ligament may respond to increased occlusal (biting) forces by resorbing some of the bone of the alveolar crest, which may result in increased tooth mobility, however these changes are reversible if the occlusal force is reduced.<ref name="Davies 2001" /> Tooth movement that occurs during occlusal loading is sometimes termed fremitus.<ref name="Wassell 2008" /> It is generally accepted that increased occlusal forces are able to increase the rate of progression of pre-existing periodontal disease (gum disease), however the main stay treatment is plaque control rather than elaborate occlusal adjustments.<ref name="Davies 2001" /> It is also generally accepted that periodontal disease is a far more common cause of tooth mobility and pathological tooth migration than any influence of bruxism, although bruxism may much less commonly be involved in both.<ref name="Wassell 2008" />
===Pain===
Most people with bruxism will experience no pain.<ref name="Cawson 2002" /> The presence or degree of pain does not necessarily correlate with the severity of grinding or clenching.<ref name="Cawson 2002" /> The pain in the muscles of mastication caused by bruxism can be likened to muscle pain after exercise.<ref name="Cawson 2002" /> The pain may be felt over the angle of the jaw (masseter) or in the temple (temporalis), and may be described as a headache or an aching jaw. Most (but not all) bruxism includes clenching force provided by masseter and temporalis muscle groups; but some bruxers clench and grind front teeth only, which involves minimal action of the masseter and temporalis muscles. The temporomandibular joints themselves may also become painful, which is usually felt just in front of the ear, or inside the ear itself. Clicking of the jaw joint may also develop. The forces exerted on the teeth are more than the periodontal ligament is biologically designed to handle, and so inflammation may result. A tooth may become sore to bite on, and further, tooth wear may reduce the insulating width of enamel and dentin that protects the pulp of the tooth and result in hypersensitivity, e.g. to cold stimuli.
The relationship of bruxism with temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD, or temporomandibular pain dysfunction syndrome) is debated. Many suggest that sleep bruxism can be a causative or contributory factor to pain symptoms in TMD.<ref name="Tyldesley 2003" /><ref name="Shetty 2010" /><ref name="Scully 2008"></ref><ref name="Glick 2003" /> Indeed, the symptoms of TMD overlap with those of bruxism.<ref name="De Meyer 1997"></ref> Others suggest that there is no strong association between TMD and bruxism.<ref name="Cawson 2002" /> A systematic review investigating the possible relationship concluded that when self-reported bruxism is used to diagnose bruxism, there is a positive association with TMD pain, and when stricter diagnostic criteria for bruxism are used, the association with TMD symptoms is much lower.<ref name="Manfredini 2010"></ref> In severe, chronic cases, bruxism can lead to myofascial pain and arthritis of the temporomandibular joints.
==Causes==
The muscles of mastication (the temporalis, masseter, medial and lateral pterygoid muscles) are paired on either side and work together to move the mandible, which hinges and slides around its dual articulation with the skull at the temporomandibular joints. Some of the muscles work to elevate the mandible (close the mouth), and others also are involved in lateral (side to side), protrusive or retractive movements. Mastication (chewing) is a complex neuromuscular activity that can be controlled either by subconscious processes or by conscious processes. In individuals without bruxism or other parafunctional activities, during wakefulness the jaw is generally at rest and the teeth are not in contact, except while speaking, swallowing or chewing. It is estimated that the teeth are in contact for less than 20 minutes per day, mostly during chewing and swallowing. Normally during sleep, the voluntary muscles are inactive due to physiologic motor paralysis, and the jaw is usually open.<ref name="Kato 2003"></ref>
Some bruxism activity is rhythmic with bite force pulses of tenths of a second (like chewing), and some have longer bite force pulses of 1 to 30 seconds (clenching). Some individuals clench without significant lateral movements. Bruxism can also be regarded as a disorder of repetitive, unconscious contraction of muscles. This typically involves the masseter muscle and the anterior portion of the temporalis (the large outer muscles that clench), and the lateral pterygoids, relatively small bilateral muscles that act together to perform sideways grinding.
The cause of bruxism is largely unknown, but it is generally accepted to have multiple possible causes.<ref name="Cawson 2002">

Bruxism is excessive teeth grinding or jaw clenching. It is an oral Parafunctional habit;<ref name="Wassell 2008"></ref> i.e., it is unrelated to normal function such as eating or talking. Bruxism is a common behavior; reports of prevalence range from 8% to 31% in the general population.<ref name="Manfredini 2013" /> Several symptoms are commonly associated with bruxism, including hypersensitive teeth, aching jaw muscles, headaches, tooth wear, and damage to dental restorations (e.g. crowns and fillings).<ref name="Tyldesley 2003" /> Symptoms may be minimal, without patient awareness of the condition.
There are two main types of bruxism: one occurs during sleep (nocturnal bruxism) and one during wakefulness (awake bruxism). Dental damage may be similar in both types, but the symptoms of sleep bruxism tend to be worse on waking and improve during the course of the day, and the symptoms of awake bruxism may not be present at all on waking, and then worsen over the day. The causes of bruxism are not completely understood, but probably involve multiple factors.<ref name="Cawson 2002" /><ref name="Shetty 2010" /> Awake bruxism is more common in women, whereas men and women are affected in equal proportions by sleep bruxism.<ref name="Shetty 2010" /> Awake bruxism is thought to have different causes from sleep bruxism. Several treatments are in use, although there is little evidence of robust efficacy for any particular treatment.<ref name="LOBBEZOO 2008" />
