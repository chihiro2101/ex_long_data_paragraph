Frank Norris

==Life==
Norris was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1870.<ref>Bernbaum, Ernest (1903). urltoken "Frank Norris," The Harvard Monthly, Vol. 36, p. 57.</ref> His father, Benjamin, was a self-made Chicago businessman and his mother, Gertrude Glorvina Doggett, had a stage career. In 1884 the family moved to San Francisco where Benjamin went into real estate. In 1887, after the death of his brother and a brief stay in London, young Norris went to Académie Julian in Paris where he studied painting for two years and was exposed to the naturalist novels of Émile Zola.<ref>Åhnebrink, Lars. The Influence of Émile Zola on Frank Norris, Lundequistska Bokhandeln, 1947.</ref><ref>Hunt, Jonathan P. Naturalist Democracy: Literary and Political Representation in the Works of Frank Norris and Émile Zola, University of California, Santa Cruz, 1996.</ref> Between 1890 and 1894 he attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he became acquainted with the ideas of human evolution of Darwin and Spencer that are reflected in his later writings. His stories appeared in the undergraduate magazine at Berkeley and in the San Francisco Wave. After his parents' divorce he went east and spent a year in the English Department of Harvard University. There he met Lewis E. Gates, who encouraged his writing. He worked as a news correspondent in South Africa (1895&ndash;96) for the San Francisco Chronicle, and then as editorial assistant for the San Francisco Wave (1896&ndash;97). He worked for McClure's as a war correspondent in Cuba during the Spanish–American War in 1898. He joined the New York City publishing firm of Doubleday & Page in 1899.
During his time at the University of California, Berkeley, Norris was a brother in the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta<ref>Wood, William Allen (1902). urltoken "A Golden Bowl Broken," Phi Gamma Delta Magazine, Vol. XXV, pp. 157–163.</ref><ref>Chamberlin, William Fosdick. The History of Phi Gamma Delta, The Fraternity, 1926.</ref><ref>Everett, Wallace W. "Frank Norris in his Chapter," Phi Gamma Delta Magazine, Vol. LII, April 1930.</ref> and was an originator of the Skull & Keys society.<ref> urltoken "Frank Norris Honored by Skull & Keys Society of California," The Phi Gamma Delta, Vol. 34, No. 6, 1912, p. 606.</ref> Because of his involvement with a prank during the Class Day Exercises in 1893, the annual alumni dinner held by each Phi Gamma Delta chapter still bears his name.<ref>Hathorn, Ralph L. (1915). urltoken "The Origin of the Pig Dinner," The Phi Gamma Delta, Vol. 38, pp. 424–427.</ref> In 1900 Frank Norris married Jeannette Black. They had a child in 1902. 
Norris died in San Francisco on October 25, 1902, of peritonitis from a ruptured appendix. <ref>"Frank Norris, the novelist, died to-day as the result of an operation for appendicitis performed three days ago". – urltoken "Death of Frank Norris," The New York Times, October 26, 1902.</ref><ref>Cooper, Frederic Taber (1902). urltoken "Frank Norris," The Bookman, Vol. 16, pp. 334–335.</ref> This left The Epic of the Wheat trilogy unfinished.<ref>"Now it makes no difference when or where or how a writer stumbles upon the idea which is to serve as his central purpose. It may spring from his head at a moment's notice like Athena, full armored – as was the case with the late Frank Norris, who, as has often been told, came one morning to his publisher's office, pale and trembling all over with excitement, and gasping out, almost inarticulately, "I've got a big idea! A great big idea! The biggest idea ever!" It was the outlined scheme for his trilogy of the Epic of the Wheat – the trilogy which began with The Octopus and The Pit, and which poor Norris did not live to round out with The Wolf." – Cooper, Frederic Taber (1920). urltoken "The Author's Purpose." In: The Craftsmanship of Writing. New York: Dodd, Mead & Company, pp. 84–85.</ref> He was only 32. He is buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California.
Charles Gilman Norris, the author's younger brother, became a well regarded novelist and editor. C. G. Norris was also the husband of the prolific novelist Kathleen Norris. The Bancroft Library of the University of California, Berkeley, houses the archives of all three writers.
==Career==
Frank Norris's work often includes depictions of suffering caused by corrupt and greedy turn-of-the-century corporate Monopoly.<ref>Rothstein, Morton (1982). "Frank Norris and Popular Perceptions of the Market," Agricultural History, Vol. 56, No. 1, pp. 50–66.</ref><ref>Zayani, Mohamed (1999). Reading the Symptom: Frank Norris, Theodore Dreiser, and the Dynamics of Capitalism. New York: Peter Lang.</ref> In The Octopus: A California Story, the Pacific and Southwest Railroad is implicated in the suffering and deaths of a number of ranchers in Southern California. At the end of the novel, after a bloody shootout between farmers and railroad agents at one of the ranches (named Los Muertos), readers are encouraged to take a "larger view" that sees that "through the welter of blood at the irrigating ditch&nbsp;. the great harvest of Los Muertos rolled like a flood from the Sierras to the Himalayas to feed thousands of starving scarecrows on the barren plains of India". Though free-wheeling market capitalism causes the deaths of many of the characters in the novel, this "larger view always&nbsp;. discovers the Truth that will, in the end, prevail, and all things, surely, inevitably, resistlessly work together for good".
The novel Vandover and the Brute, written in the 1890s, but not published until after his death, is about three college friends preparing to become successful, and the ruin of one due to a degenerate lifestyle.<ref>Geismar, Maxwell (1953). "Frank Norris and the Brute." In: Rebels and Ancestors. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, pp. 3–66.</ref>
In addition to Zola's,<ref>Montague, G.H. (1901). urltoken "Two American Disciples of Zola," The Harvard Monthly, Vol. 32, pp. 204–212.</ref> Norris's writing has been compared to that of Stephen Crane,<ref>Wertheim, Stanley (1991). "Frank Norris and Stephen Crane: Conviction and Uncertainty," American Literary Realism, 1870–1910, Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 54–62.</ref> Theodore Dreiser, and Edith Wharton.<ref>McElrath, Jr. Joseph R. and Gwendolyn Jones (1994). "Introduction" to The Pit. New York: Penguin Books.</ref>
==Critical reception==
Although some of his novels remain highly admired, aspects of Norris's work have not fared well with literary critics in the late 20th and early 21st century. As Donald Pizer writes "Frank Norris's racism, which included the most vicious anti-Semitic portrayals in any major work of American literature, has long been an embarrassment to admirers of the vigor and intensity of his best fiction and has also contributed to the decline of his reputation during the past several generations."<ref></ref> Other scholars have confirmed Norris's antisemitism.<ref>Lebowich, Joseph (1904). urltoken "The Jew of Frank Norris," The Menorah, Vol. XXXVI, pp. 27–31.</ref><ref>Levy, Richard S. (2005). Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, Vol. I, ABC-CLIO, pp. 511–512 </ref> Norris's work is often seen as strongly influenced by the scientific racism of the late 19th century, such as that espoused by his professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Joseph LeConte.<ref></ref> Along with his contemporary Jack London, Norris is seen as "reconstructing American identity as a biological category of Anglo-Saxon masculinity."<ref></ref> In Norris's work, critics have seen evidence of racism, antisemitism, and contempt for immigrants and the working poor, all of whom are seen as the losers in a Social Darwinism struggle for existence.<ref></ref> Additionally, his "exaggeratedly muscular novels" seem to posit women as biologically subordinate to men.<ref></ref>
==Legacy==
* Norris's novel The Pit was adapted for the theater by Channing Pollock in four acts. Produced by William A. Brady, the play premiered at New York's Lyric Theatre on February 10, 1904. A film adaptation of The Pit was produced in 1917, by William A. Brady's Picture Plays Inc.
