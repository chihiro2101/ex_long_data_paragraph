David Souter

== U.S. Supreme Court career ==
Souter opposed having cameras in the Supreme Court during oral arguments because he said questions would be taken out of context by the media and the proceedings would be politicized.<ref name="AP"> urltoken On Cameras in Supreme Court, Souter Says, 'Over My Dead Body', The New York Times, March 30, 1996 </ref>
He also served as the court's designated representative to Congress on at least one occasion, testifying before committees of that body about the court's needs for additional funding to refurbish its building and for other projects.<ref name="biography" />
=== Expected conservatism ===
At the time of Souter's appointment, John Sununu assured President Bush and conservatives that Souter would be a "home run" for conservatism.<ref></ref> In his testimony before the Senate, he was thought by conservatives to be a strict constructionism on constitutional matters, but he portrayed himself as a moderate who disliked radical change and attached a high importance to precedent.<ref></ref><ref>Roosevelt, Kermit.

After the appointment of Clarence Thomas, Souter moved to the ideological middle.<ref name="nytimes" /> In two 1992 cases, Souter voted with the Court's liberal wing: Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in which the Court reaffirmed the essential holding in Roe v. Wade; and Lee v. Weisman, in which Souter voted against allowing prayer at a high school graduation ceremony. In Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Kennedy considered overturning Roe and upholding all the restrictions at issue in Casey. Souter considered upholding all the restrictions but was uneasy about overturning Roe. After consulting with O'Connor, the three (who came to be known as the "troika") developed a joint opinion that upheld all the restrictions in Casey except the mandatory notification of a husband while asserting the essential holding of Roe, that the Constitution protects the right to an abortion.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
By the late 1990s, Souter began to align himself more with Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, although as of 1995, he sided on more occasions with the more liberal<ref>Rosen, Jeffrey urltoken The Dissenter: Majority of One, Stevens at the Supreme Court, The New York Times, September 23, 2007</ref> justice John Paul Stevens than either Breyer or Ginsburg, both Clinton appointees.<ref name="national review">Ponnuru, Ramesh urltoken Empty Souter-Supreme Court Justice David Souter, National Review, September 11, 1995 </ref> O'Connor began to move to the center. On death penalty cases, worker rights cases, criminal rights cases, and other issues, Souter began voting with the Court's liberals,<ref>(see Segal-Cover score)</ref> and came to be considered part of the Court's liberal wing. Because of this, many conservatives view Souter's appointment an error of the Bush presidency.<ref>Greenfield, Jeff urltoken David Souter: The Justice Who Built The Trump Court Politico Magazine, July 9, 2018</ref> For example, after widespread speculation that President George W. Bush intended to appoint Alberto Gonzales—whose perceived views on affirmative action and abortion drew criticism—to the Court, some conservative Senate staffers popularized the slogan "Gonzales is Spanish for Souter".<ref></ref>
A Wall Street Journal opinion piece ten years after Souter's nomination called Souter a "liberal jurist" and said that Rudman took "pride in recounting how he sold Mr. Souter to gullible White House Chief of Staff John Sununu as a confirmable conservative. Then they both sold the judge to President Bush, who wanted above all else to avoid a confirmation battle."<ref></ref> Rudman wrote in his memoir that he had "suspected all along" that Souter would not "overturn activist liberal precedents."<ref name="biography" /> Sununu later said that he had "a lot of disappointment" in Souter's positions on the court and would have preferred him to be more like Scalia.<ref name="biography" />
=== Notable decisions ===
==== Planned Parenthood v. Casey ====
In 1992's Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Souter wrote that Roe v. Wade should not be overturned because it would be "a surrender to political pressure. So to overrule under fire in the absence of the most compelling reason to re-examine a watershed decision would subvert the Court's legitimacy beyond any serious question."<ref></ref>
==== Bush v. Gore ====
In 2000, Souter voted along with three other justices in Bush v. Gore to allow the presidential election recount to continue while the majority voted to end the recount. The decision allowed the declaration of Bush as the winner of the election in Florida to stand.
Jeffrey Toobin wrote, controversially, of Souter's reaction to Bush v. Gore in his 2007 book The Nine: 
The above passage was disputed by Souter's longtime friend Warren Rudman. Rudman told the New Hampshire Union Leader that while Souter was discomfited by Bush v. Gore, it was not true that he had broken down into tears over it.<ref name="wsjlawblog" />
=== Relationship with other justices ===
Souter worked well with Sandra Day O'Connor and had a good relationship with both her and her husband during her days on the court.<ref name="biography" /> He generally had a good working relationship with every justice, but was particularly fond of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and considered John Paul Stevens to be the "smartest" justice.<ref name="biography" />
=== International recognition ===
Even though Souter had never traveled outside the United States during his years with the Supreme Court, he still gained significant recognition abroad. In 1995, a series of articles based on his written opinions and titled "Souter Court" was published by a Moscow legal journal, The Russian Justice. Those were followed by a book, written in Russian and bearing Souter's name in the title.<ref>Петр Баренбойм, "3000 лет доктрины разделения властей: Суд Сьютера", M., 1996. / Petr Barenboim, "3000 years of the separation of powers doctrine: Souter court", Moscow, 1996; 2nd ed., 2003. / , urltoken Justice of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation Yury Danilov, reviewing the 2nd edition of the book in a Moscow English-language daily, made the following remark on Souter's position in Bush v. Gore: "In a most critical and delicate situation, David Souter had maintained the independence of his position and in this respect had become a symbol of the independence of the judiciary."<ref>Yury Danilov, The Judiciary: From Samuel to Souter, The Moscow News, October 15, 2003.</ref><ref>Peter Barenboim, urltoken «Biblical Roots of Separation of Powers», Moscow, 2005, p.163, </ref>
=== Retirement ===
Long before the election of President Obama, Souter had expressed a desire to leave Washington, D.C., and return to New Hampshire.<ref name=wapo043009></ref><ref></ref> The election of a Democratic president in 2008 made Souter more inclined to retire, but he did not want to create a situation in which there would be multiple vacancies at once.<ref name="npr_20090430"></ref> Souter apparently became satisfied that no other justices planned to retire at the end of the Supreme Court's term in June 2009.<ref name=npr_20090430 /> As a result, in mid-April 2009 he privately notified the White House of his intent to retire at the conclusion of that term.<ref name=nyt_20090528></ref> Souter sent Obama a retirement letter on May 1, effective at the start of the Supreme Court's 2009 summer recess.<ref name="Souter Resignation letter-2009-05-01"></ref> Later that day Obama made an unscheduled appearance during the daily White House press briefing to announce Souter's retirement.<ref name=nyt_20090501> urltoken Obama Announces Souter Retirement, The New York Times, Caucus Blog, May 1, 2009</ref> On May 26, 2009, Obama announced his nomination of federal appeals court judge Sonia Sotomayor. She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August 6.
On June 29, 2009, the last day of the Court's 2008–09 term, Chief Justice Roberts read a letter to Souter that had been signed by all eight of his colleagues as well as retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, thanking him for his service, and Souter read a letter to his colleagues reciprocating their good wishes.<ref></ref>
Souter, Sandra Day O'Connor, and Anthony Kennedy are the Supreme Court's only living former justices.
== Post-Supreme Court career ==
As a Supreme Court justice with retired status, Souter remains a judge and is entitled to sit by designation on lower courts. Since his retirement from the Supreme Court, he regularly sits by designation on panels of the First Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Boston and covering Maine, Massachusetts, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, and his native New Hampshire, generally in February or March of each year.<ref name="2010report"></ref><ref></ref>
== Personal life ==
Once named by The Washington Post as one of Washington's 10 Most Eligible Bachelors,<ref name="biography" /> Souter has never married, though he was once engaged.<ref>Totenberg, Nina urltoken "Supreme Court Justice Souter To Retire", NPR, April 30, 2009</ref>
In 2004, Souter was mugged while jogging between his home and the Fort Lesley J. McNair Army Base in Washington, DC. He suffered minor injuries from the event, visiting the MedStar Washington Hospital Center for treatment.<ref></ref> The issue led to public questioning of the Supreme Court Police's security detail, which was not present at the time.<ref></ref>
According to Jeffrey Toobin's 2007 book The Nine, Souter has a decidedly low-tech lifestyle: He writes with a fountain pen, does not use e-mail, and has no cell phone or answering machine. While he was serving on the Supreme Court, he preferred to drive back to New Hampshire for the summer where he enjoyed mountain climbing.<ref name="biography" /> Souter has also done his own home repairs<ref name="NYT"> urltoken A No-Frills Embrace for a Low-Key Justice, The New York Times, May 3, 2009</ref> and is known for his daily lunch of an apple and yogurt.<ref></ref>
Former Supreme Court correspondent Linda Greenhouse wrote of Souter: "to focus on his eccentricities—his daily lunch of yogurt and an apple, core and all; the absence of a computer in his personal office—is to miss the essence of a man who in fact is perfectly suited to his job, just not to its trappings. His polite but persistent questioning of lawyers who appear before the court displays his meticulous preparation and his mastery of the case at hand and the cases relevant to it. Far from being out of touch with the modern world, he has simply refused to surrender to it control over aspects of his own life that give him deep contentment: hiking, sailing, time with old friends, reading history."<ref></ref>
In early August 2009, Souter moved from his family farm house in Weare to a Cape Cod-style single-floor home in Hopkinton, New Hampshire, a town adjacent to the state capital of Concord. Souter told a disappointed Weare neighbor that the two-story family farmhouse was not structurally sound enough to support the thousands of books he owns and that he wished to live on one level.<ref name="nyt 20090803"> urltoken Off the Bench, Souter Leaves Farmhouse Behind, The New York Times, August 3, 2009</ref>
Over the years, Souter has served on hospital boards and civic committees.<ref></ref><ref></ref> He is a former honorary co-chair of the We the People National Advisory Committee.<ref> urltoken National Advisory Committee</ref>

Despite the opposition, Souter won confirmation easily.<ref name="presidential leadership">Taranto, James and Leo, Leonard urltoken "Presidential Leadership", Free Press, 2004</ref> The Senate Judiciary Committee reported out the nomination by a vote of 14–3, the Senate confirmed the nomination by a vote of 90–9,<ref></ref> and Souter took his seat shortly thereafter, on October 9, 1990.
The nine senators voting against Souter included Ted Kennedy and John Kerry from Souter's neighboring state of Massachusetts. These senators, along with seven others, painted Souter as a right-winger in the mold of Robert Bork.<ref></ref>
