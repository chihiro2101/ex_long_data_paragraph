Arthur Laffer

=== Presidential Medal of Freedom ===
On May 31, 2019, The White House announced that President Trump would be awarding Laffer with the Presidential Medal of Freedom on June 19, 2019.<ref name=":5" /> The Presidential Medal of Freedom is "the Nation's highest civilian honor, which may be awarded by the President to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors".<ref name=":5" /> The White House press released stated that Laffer was receiving the award for "public service and contributions to economic policy that have helped spur prosperity for our Nation".<ref name=":5" /> The press release said that Laffer as "one of the most influential economists in American history" due to popularizing the "Laffer curve."<ref name=":5" /> Trump praised Laffer for policies that he said brought "greater opportunity for all Americans."<ref></ref>
==Laffer curve==
Although he does not claim to have invented the Laffer curve concept (Laffer, 2004), it was popularized with policy-makers following an afternoon meeting with Nixon/Ford Administration officials Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld in 1974 in which he reportedly sketched the curve on a napkin to illustrate his argument.<ref></ref> The term "Laffer curve" was coined by Jude Wanniski, who was also present. The basic concept was not new; Laffer himself says he learned it from Ibn Khaldun and John Maynard Keynes.<ref></ref>
The Laffer curve is an economic theory that shows the relationship between tax rates and the amount of tax revenue collected by governments. The Laffer Curve shows that there is a certain point between 0% and 100% where tax revenues are maximized. The curve suggests that starting from zero, an increase in tax rates will increase the government's tax revenue; after a certain point, however, continuing to increase tax rates will cause a decrease in tax revenue.<ref name="auto1"/> This decrease in tax revenue can be explained by decreased incentives for work, production, etc.<ref name=":2"></ref> Laffer's postulate was that the tax rate that maximizes revenue was at a much lower level than previously believed: so low that current tax rates were above the level where revenue is maximized. While many economists believe that government spending to stimulate demand for products should be the solution for a poorly performing economy, Laffer argues that heavy taxes and regulation impede production, and therefore, government revenue.<ref name=":2" />
Numerous leading economists have rejected the view that a tax rate cut of current federal US income taxes can lead to increased tax revenue. When asked whether a "cut in federal income tax rates in the US right now would raise taxable income enough so that the annual total tax revenue would be higher within five years than without the tax cut," 96% of economists surveyed in 2012 disagreed.<ref> urltoken According to Greg Mankiw, most economists have been very skeptical of Laffer's contention that decreases in tax rates could increase tax revenue, at least in the United States. In his textbook, Mankiw states, "there was little evidence for Laffer's view that U.S. tax rates had in fact reached such extreme levels."<ref name="mankiw"></ref> Under the direction of conservative economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the Congressional Budget Office conducted a 2005 study on the fiscal effects of a 10% cut in federal income tax rates, finding that it resulted in a significant net revenue loss.<ref></ref><ref>Analyzing the Economic and Budgetary Effects of a 10 Percent Cut in Income Tax Rates, Congressional Budget Office, December 1, 2005: urltoken Economist John Quiggin distinguishes between the Laffer curve and Laffer's analysis of tax rates. The Laffer curve was "correct but unoriginal", but Laffer's analysis that the United States was on the wrong side of the Laffer curve "was original but incorrect."<ref name=":3"></ref>
Laffer was an economic adviser to Kansas Governor Sam Brownback, who in 2012 zeroed out state tax liability for approximately 330,000 of the top wage earners in the state, contending it would be a "shot of adrenaline into the heart of the Kansas economy."<ref>Topeka Capital Journal, 2013</ref><ref></ref> The state, which had previously had a budget surplus, experienced a budget deficit of about $200 million in 2012. Drastic cuts to state funding for education and infrastructure were implemented to close budget deficits and the Kansas economy underperformed relative to neighboring states.<ref>Kansas City Star, 2015</ref> Brownback's tax overhaul was described in a June 2017 article in The Atlantic as the United States' "most aggressive experiment in conservative economic policy".<ref name="theatlantic_tax_experiment_dead_2017"></ref> The drastic tax cuts had "threatened the viability of schools and infrastructure" in Kansas. The Kansas legislature repealed the tax cut in June 2017, overriding the veto of governor Brownback.<ref name="theatlantic_tax_experiment_dead_2017"/>

In 2018, Laffer wrote the book Trumponomics with conservative economic commentator Stephen Moore, wherein they lauded the Trump administration's economic policies.<ref name=":02"></ref> In the book, Moore and Laffer argue that the Trump administration's 2017 tax plan would raise growth rates to as much as 6% and not increase budget deficits.<ref name=":02" /> In a 2019 review of the book, Greg Mankiw, a conservative economics professor at Harvard University, said the authors "do not build their analysis on the foundation of professional consensus or serious studies from peer-reviewed journals. . . . The Laffer curve is undeniable as a matter of economic theory. There is certainly some level of taxation at which cutting tax rates would be win-win. But few economists believe that tax rates in the United States have reached such heights in recent years; to the contrary, they are likely below the revenue-maximizing level."<ref name=":02" /> The one issue where Moore and Laffer disagree with Trump is on the issue of free trade, which the duo supports.<ref name=":02" /> Previously, in 2016, Laffer said that he believed that then-candidate Trump was "going to be okay on trade" and lauded Trump's understanding of trade.<ref></ref><ref name="cbsnews.com"></ref>
Laffer regularly writes opinion articles in The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Times.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
On April 15, 2019, Laffer blamed the Great Recession on Barack Obama, "who I believe was the reason why we had the Great Recession. As he got closer and closer to winning the markets collapsed."<ref></ref>
In 2020, Laffer advised the Trump administration on how to re-open the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> Laffer argued for halting coronavirus rescue relief spending, calling instead for payroll tax cuts.<ref></ref><ref name="FormerReagan"></ref> He advocated for taxes on non-profit organizations in education and the arts, as well as for salary reductions for professors and government officials.<ref name="FormerReagan" /> He argued against expansion of unemployment aid, arguing it discouraged people from working.<ref name="FormerReagan" />
