The finger

==Origin==
===Classical era===
The middle finger gesture was used in ancient times as a symbol of sexual intercourse, in a manner meant to degrade, intimidate and threaten the individual receiving the gesture.<ref name="sanjose"/> It also represented the phallus, with the fingers next to the middle finger representing testicles;<ref name="offensive" /> from its close association, the gesture may have assumed apotropaic potency.<ref name="Corbeill"/> In the 1st-century Mediterranean world, extending the finger was one of many methods used to divert the ever-present threat of the evil eye.<ref name="The New Testament World: Insights from Cultural Anthropology"/>
In Greek the gesture was known as the katapygon<ref name="tufts" /><ref name="Before Sexuality: The Construction of Erotic Experience in the Ancient Greek World"/> (κατάπυγον, from kata&nbsp;– κατά, "downwards"<ref name="tufts1"/> and pugē&nbsp;– πυγή, "rump, buttocks"<ref name="tufts2"/>). In ancient Greek comedy, the finger was a gesture of insult toward another person, with the term katapugon also referring to "a male who submits to anal penetration"<ref name="Not the classical ideal: Athens and the construction of the other in Greek art"/> or katapygaina to a female.<ref name="The Poetics of Eros in Ancient Greece"/> In Aristophanes's comedy The Clouds (423 BC),<ref name="Dover"/> when the character Socrates is quizzing his student on poetic meters, Strepsiades declares that he knows quite well what a dactyl is, and gives the finger. The gesture is a visual pun on the two meanings of the Greek word daktylos, both "finger" and the rhythmic measure composed of a long syllable and two short, like the joints of a finger which also appears as a visual pun on the penis and testicles in a medieval Latin text<ref name="The Latin Sexual Vocabulary"/>). Socrates called one who made the gesture "boorish and stupid".<ref name="Dover"/><ref name="Clouds (ll. 650-6)"/> The gesture recurs as a form of mockery in Peace, alongside farting in someone's face;<ref name="Peace (ll. 546-9)"/><ref name="tufts3"/> the usage is later explained in the Suda and included in the Adagia of Erasmus.<ref name="stoa"/><ref name="Adages III.iii.87"/> The verb "to play the Sifnos" appears in a fragment of Aristophanes and has a similar meaning;<ref name="tufts4"/><ref name="The Maculate Muse: Obscene Language in Attic Comedy"/> the usage is once again explained in the Suda, where it is said to mean "to touch the anus with a finger".<ref name="stoa5"/> Diogenes Laërtius records how the Cynic philosopher Diogenes of Sinope directed the gesture at the orator Demosthenes in 4th-century BC Athens.<ref name="Laërtius"/> In the Discourses of Epictetus, Diogenes's target is instead one of the sophists.<ref name="Discourses of Epictetus III.2.i"/>
In Latin, the middle finger was the digitus impudicus, meaning the "shameless, indecent or offensive finger".<ref name="offensive" /> In the 1st century AD, Persius had superstitious female relatives concoct a charm with the "infamous finger" (digitus Infamia) and "purifying spit";<ref name="Satires II.33" /><ref name="Adages II.iv.68" /> while in the Satyricon, an old woman uses dust, spit and her middle finger to mark the forehead before casting a spell.<ref name="Satyricon 131" /> The poet Martial has a character in good health extend "the indecent one" toward three doctors.<ref name="offensive" /><ref name="Epigrammata VI.70.5" /> In another epigram, Martial wrote: "Laugh loud, Sextillus, at whoever calls you a cinaedus and extend your middle finger."<ref name="Epigrammata II.28.1-2" /><ref name="Roman Homosexuality" /> Juvenal, through synecdoche, has the "middle nail" cocked at threatening Fortuna.<ref name="Satire X.52-3" /> The indecent finger features again in a mocking context in the Priapeia, a collection of poems relating to the phallic god Priapus.<ref name="Corbeill" /> In Late Antiquity, the term "shameless finger" is explained in the Etymologiae of Isidore of Seville with reference to its frequent use when accusing someone of a "shameful action".<ref name="The Body Legal in Barbarian Law" />

According to anthropologist Desmond Morris, the gesture probably came to the United States via Italian immigrants.<ref name="offensive" /> The first documented appearance of the finger in the United States was in 1886, when Charles Radbourn, a baseball pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters, was photographed giving it to a member of their rival the New York Giants.<ref name="offensive" /> In the film Speedy (1928), Harold Lloyd's character gives himself the finger into a distorting mirror at Luna Park, about 25 minutes into the film.

===Politics and military incidents===
The gesture has been involved in notable political events. During the incident, in which an American ship was captured by North Korea, the captured American crewmembers often discreetly gave the finger in staged photo ops, thus ruining the North Koreans' efforts at propaganda. The North Koreans, ignorant of what the gesture meant, were at first told by the prisoners that it was a "Hawaiian good luck sign", similar to the shaka. When the guards finally figured things out, the crewmembers were subjected to extremely severe beatings.<ref name="The Digit Affair" /> Abbie Hoffman used the gesture at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.<ref name="sanjose" /> Ronald Reagan, while serving as the Governor of California, gave the middle finger to counterculture protestors in Berkeley, California.<ref name="sanjose" /> Nelson Rockefeller, then the Vice President of the United States, directed the gesture to hecklers at a 1976 campaign stop near Binghamton, New York, leading it to be called the "Rockefeller gesture".<ref name="sanjose" /> Pierre Trudeau, then the Prime Minister of Canada, gave the finger to protesters in Salmon Arm, British Columbia,<ref name="Top aide put on spot over Trudeau's one-finger gesture" /> earning the incident the nickname the "Salmon Arm salute".<ref></ref> The gesture itself has also been nicknamed the "Trudeau salute".<ref></ref> Former president George W.

During World War II, the 91st Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces referred to the gesture as the "rigid digit" salute. It was used in a more jocular manner, to suggest an airman had committed an error or infraction; the term was a reference to British slang terms for inattentiveness (i.e. "pull your finger out (of your bum)").<ref name="Freeman" /> The "order of the rigid digit" continued after the war as a series of awards presented by the veteran's association of the 91st, marked by wooden statuettes of a hand giving the single finger gesture.<ref name="91stbombgroup" /> In 2005 during the war in Iraq, Gunnery Sergeant Michael Burghardt gained prominence when the Omaha World-Herald published a photo of Burghardt making the gesture towards Iraqi insurgents he believed to be watching after an improvised explosive device failed to kill him.<ref></ref>
The middle finger has been involved in judicial hearings. An appellate court in Hartford, Connecticut ruled in 1976 that gesturing with the middle finger was offensive, but not obscene, after a police officer charged a 16-year-old with making an obscene gesture when the student gave the officer the middle finger.<ref name="Raising middle finger not obscene, judges say" /> The case was appealed to the Connecticut Supreme Court,<ref name="Leonard Backing Court Appeal On Middle Finger" /> which upheld the decision.<ref name="moving finger" /> In March 2006, a federal lawsuit was filed regarding the free speech issue.<ref name="Middle finger salute leads to federal lawsuit" />

==Similar gestures==
In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, the V sign, "two-fingered salute" or "the fingers", when given with back of the hand towards the recipient, serves a similar purpose. According to a Royal Shakespeare Company synopsis of the play Henry V, a "two-fingered salute" appeared in the Macclesfield Psalter of (in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge), "being made by a glove in the psalter's marginalia". George H. W. Bush, former President of the United States, accidentally made the gesture while on a diplomatic trip to Australia.<ref name="google7" />
In countries where Spanish, Portuguese or French are spoken, and especially in Spain, Portugal, Brazil and France, the gesture involving raising a fist and slapping the biceps on the same arm as the fist used, sometimes called the bras d'honneur (French), corte de mangas (Spanish), manguito (Portugal), dar uma banana (Brazil), or Iberian slap, is equivalent to the finger.
Italy, Poland and countries under the influence of Russian culture, such as Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, also see it as equivalent to the finger, but the majority of young people in these countries use the finger as an insult, which is associated with the Western culture.<ref name="offensive" />
In Islamic countries and cultures, a gesture involving exposing only the thumb in a vertical orientation&nbsp;– a thumbs up&nbsp;– is used in lieu of the finger to express roughly the same sentiment.<ref name="aok" /> A similarly obscene gesture is extending all five digits with the palm facing forward, meaning "you have five fathers", thus calling someone a bastard.<ref name="aok" /> This is similar to a gesture known in Greece as the Moutza, where the five fingers are spread wide and the palm is pushed towards the recipient.<ref name="kass" /> More commonly in Turkish or Slavic regions, the fig sign (also known as nah or shish) serves as the equivalent to the finger, meaning "you won't get it" or "in your dreams".

In Western culture, "the finger" or the middle finger (as in giving someone the (middle) finger or the bird<ref name="Kipfer" /> or flipping someone off)<ref name="Kipfer" /> is an obscene hand gesture. The gesture communicates moderate to extreme contempt, and is roughly equivalent in meaning to Fuck#Modern usage, "shove it up your ass/arse", "up yours" or "go fuck yourself". It is performed by showing the back of a hand that has only the middle finger extended upwards, though in some locales, the thumb is extended. Extending the finger is considered a symbol of contempt in several cultures, especially in the Western world. Many cultures use similar gestures to display their disrespect, although others use it to express pointing without intentional disrespect. The gesture is usually used to express contempt but can also be used humorously or playfully.
The gesture dates back to ancient Greece and it was also used in ancient Rome. Historically, it represented the phallus. In the early 1800s, it gained increasing recognition as a sign of disrespect and was used by music artists (notably more common among actors, celebrities, athletes and politicians; most still view the gesture as obscene). The index finger and ring finger besides the middle finger in more contemporary periods has been likened to represent the testes.<ref></ref>
