Crown prince

==Description==
The term crown prince is not used in European monarchies wherein the hereditary sovereign holds a title below that of king/queen or emperor/empress (such as grand duke or prince), although it is sometimes used as a synonym for heir apparent.
In Europe, where primogeniture governed succession to all monarchies except those of the Pope and Andorra, the eldest son or (more recently) eldest child of the current monarch fills the role of crown prince or princess, depending upon whether females of the dynasty enjoy personal succession rights. Male-precedence has been abolished in Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The eldest living child of a monarch is sometimes not the heir apparent or crown prince, because that position can be held by a descendant of a deceased older child who, by "right of representation", inherits the same place in the line of succession that would be held by the ancestor if he or she were still living (for example, Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden was the crown prince of Sweden from 1950 to 1973, as the senior grandson by male primogeniture of King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, although the former Prince Sigvard, Duke of Uppland was Gustaf VI Adolf's eldest living son, and Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland his eldest living dynasty son during those years).
In some monarchies, those of the Middle East for example, in which primogeniture is not the decisive factor in dynastic succession, a person may not possess the title or status of crown prince by right of birth, but may obtain (and lose) it as a result of an official designation made on some other legal or traditional basis, such as former crown prince Hassan bin Talal of Jordan.
Compare heir apparent and heir presumptive. In Scandinavian kingdoms, the heir presumptive to the crown may hold a different title than the heir apparent: hereditary prince (German: Erbprinz, French: prince héréditaire). It is also the title borne by the heir apparent of Liechtenstein, as well as the heir apparent or presumptive of Monaco. In Luxembourg, the heir apparent bears the title of hereditary grand duke (German: erbgroßherzog, Luxembourgish: ierfgroussherzog); along with hereditary prince, it was also the title borne by the heirs apparent to the thrones of the grand duchies, sovereign duke and prince, and of mediatized princely families in the German abolished monarchies in 1918.
==Christian/Western traditional titles==
Many monarchies use or did use Substantive title for their heirs apparent, often of historical origin:
*Dauphin (Ancient Regime)
*Duke of Brabant (Belgium)
*Duke of Braganza (Kingdom of Portugal)
*Duke of Cornwall (Kingdom of England), currently one of the titles of the Prince of Wales
*Duke of Rothesay (Kingdom of Scotland), currently used by the Prince of Wales in place of his Welsh title when in Scotland
*Grand Prince (Grand Duchy of Tuscany)
*Margrave of Moravia (Kingdom of Bohemia)
*Prince of Asturias (Castile & Spain), also used by heir presumptives
*Prince of Girona (Aragon & Spain)
*Prince Imperial (Empire of Brazil, Second French Empire, and Empire of Mexico)
*Prince of Orange (Netherlands), whether or not the equivalent title is held by the spouse of the titleholder is decided by the Dutch parliament (e.g., Queen Máxima of the Netherlands was never titled Princess of Orange by marriage for this reason)
*Prince of Piedmont (Kingdom of Sardinia, and then Kingdom of Italy, when it was alternated with Prince of Naples) once conferred by King Joseph Bonaparte 
*Prince Royal (France in 1789–1791 and the July Monarchy, and Portugal since 1815)
*Prince of Turnovo (Kingdom of Bulgaria)
*Prince of Viana (Navarre & Spain)
*Rex iunior (Kingdom of Hungary), lit. junior king as he was crowned during the life of the incumbent king
*Tsesarevich (Russia)
Some monarchies have used (although not always de jure) a territorial title for heirs apparent which, though often perceived as a crown princely title, is not automatically hereditary. It generally requires a specific conferral by the sovereign, which may be withheld.
Current and past titles in this category include:
*Caesar or Kaisar (Roman and early Byzantine Empires) in honor of Julius Caesar, distinguished from the senior Augustus
*Symbasileus (late Byzantine Empire), lit. co-emperor but still distinguished from the senior who was addressed as Autocrator
*Aetheling (Anglo-Saxon England) and edling (Welsh kingdoms), lit. of the royal family
*Duke of Estonia and Lolland (Denmark; during, at least, reigns of Christopher II and Valdemar IV)
*Prince of Norway (Denmark-Norway); in 15th–19th centuries
*Duke of Valentinois, used by several heirs to the Monégasque throne
*Prince of Wales (England, Great Britain, United Kingdom)
*King of the Romans (Holy Roman Empire) – an elective, rather than an inherited title, for the designated successor—usually the son, but sometimes the brother—of the Emperor
*King of Rome (First French Empire)
*Duke of Sparta (Kingdom of Greece); used briefly, within Greece, only by Prince Constantine, during the reign of his father King George I
*Marquess of Baux, used by several heirs to the Monégasque throne
*Prince of Brazil (title of the Portugal heir from 1645 to 1815)
*Duke of Scania (Sweden during the time when Magnus IV of Sweden also was King of Terra Scania)
*Prince of Ani (Kingdom of West Armenia)
*Prince of Alba Iulia (Kingdom of Romania)
*Grand Voivode of Grahovo (Kingdom of Montenegro)
*Prince of Venice (see Prince Eugène de Beauharnais); for the heir presumptive to Napoleon I in his Kingdom of Italy
*Duke of Calabria (Kingdom of Naples and Kingdom of the Two Sicilies); prior to the accession of King Robert the title of the Neapolitan heir was Prince of Salerno

===Notes===
===References===

A crown prince is the heir apparent to the throne in a royal or imperial monarchy. The female form of the title is crown princess, which may refer either to an heiress apparent or, especially in earlier times, to the wife of the person styled crown prince.
Crown prince as a descriptive term has been used throughout history for the prince who is first-in-line to a throne and is expected to succeed (i.e. the heir apparent), barring any unforeseen future event preventing this. In certain monarchies, a more specific substantive title may be accorded and become associated with the position of heir apparent (e.g. Prince of Wales in the United Kingdom). In these monarchies, the term crown prince may be used less often than the substantive title (or never).
Until the late twentieth century, no modern monarchy adopted a system whereby females would be guaranteed to succeed to the throne (i.e. absolute primogeniture). A crown princess would therefore be more likely to refer to the spouse of a crown prince. She would be styled crown princess, not in her own right but by courtesy.
