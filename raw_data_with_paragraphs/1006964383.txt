Robert Smithson

====Industrial ruins and disrupted landscapes====
While Smithson did not find "beauty" in the evidence of abuse and neglect, he did see the state of things as demonstrative of the continually transforming relationships between humans and landscape. He claimed, "the best sites for 'earth art' are sites that have been disrupted by industry, reckless urbanization, or nature's own devastation." <ref>.</ref> Smithson became particularly interested in the notion of industrial decay within the spectrum of anti-aesthetic dynamic relationships which he saw present in the picturesque landscape. In his proposal to make process art out of the dredging of The Pond in Central Park, Smithson sought to insert himself into the dynamic evolution of the park.<ref>.</ref> While in earlier 18th-century formal characterizations of the pastoral and the sublime, something like a "gash in the ground" or pile of rocks, if encountered by a "leveling improver", as described by Price, would have been smoothed over and the area terraformed into a more aesthetically pleasing contour.<ref></ref> For Smithson, it was not necessary that the disruption become a visual aspect of a landscape; by his anti-formalist logic, more important was the temporal scar worked over by natural or human intervention. He saw parallels to Olmsted's Central Park as a "sylvan" green overlay on the depleted landscape that preceded his Central Park <ref>.</ref> Defending himself against allegations that he and other earth artists "cut and gouge the land like Army engineers", Smithson, in his own essay, charges that one of such opinions "failed to recognize the possibility of a direct organic manipulation of the land." and would "turn his back on the contradictions that inhabit our landscapes".<ref>.</ref>
==Significant works==
===Spiral Jetty===
Spiral Jetty (1970) is an Land art in the form of a 1,500-foot-long (460 m), 15-foot-wide (4.6 m) counterclockwise spiral of local basalt rocks and mud, forming a jetty that juts from the shore of the Great Salt Lake near Rozel Point in Utah. Over the years it has accumulated a patina of salt crystals when the level of the lake is low.<ref name=writings></ref> Some art historians consider the Spiral Jetty to be the most important work by Smithson. He documented the construction of the sculpture in a 32-minute color film also titled Spiral Jetty.<ref name="writings" /><ref name="Hobbs" /> Smithson wrote that he deliberately chose the site due to its proximity to a derelict oil jetty. In later years oil and gas extraction has threatened the area.<ref name="Johnson NYT 2008"></ref>
===Partially Buried Woodshed===
Partially Buried Woodshed (1970) is an land art created at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio.<ref></ref> The work consisted of a derelict woodshed on campus that he covered with earth until the central beam broke, illustrating the concept of entropy. By 2018, only a mound of dirt and the structure's concrete foundation remain. An informational plaque is located in a small wooded area immediately behind the Liquid Crystal Institute building on the Kent State University main campus.<ref name=archives></ref>
===Broken Circle/Spiral Hill===
In 1971 he created Broken Circle/Spiral Hill for the exhibition for the Sonsbeek'71 art festival at Emmen, the Netherlands.<ref name="Tuchman"></ref> The subject of the 1971 Sonsbeek exhibition was Beyond Lawn and Order (Dutch: Buiten de perken). The Broken Circle earthwork was built in a quarry lake 10-to-15 feet deep. It was 140 feet in diameter, with the canal 12 feet wide, and built of white and yellow sand. The accompanying Spiral Hill is made of earth, black topsoil, and white sand, and was 75 feet in diameter at its base.<ref name="Hobbs" /><ref></ref>
==Unrealized projects==
During his lifetime, Smithson created several proposals for projects that were unrealized, either due to their visionary nature, lack support or their impracticality. Between 1966 and 1967 he produced Proposals for the Dallas-Fort Worth Regional Airport as concepts for "aerial art", monumental-scaled earthworks to be seen by air travelers.<ref name="Hobbs" /> In 1970 Smithson created a series of drawing for Floating Island: To Travel around Manhattan Island. The proposed project consisted of a barge containing broken concrete or glass to be pulled by a tugboat around Manhattan. Other versions of the project were of a barge filled with earth and plated with trees and other vegetation.<ref name="Hobbs" /> In 1971 he drew Towards the Development of a "Cinema Cavern", a design for a theater to be built inside a cave with spelunkers as the intended audience.<ref name="Reynolds"></ref> In 1973 he designed the Bingham Canyon Reclamation Project, a visionary proposal for the copper pit mine in Utah owned by the Kennecott Copper Corporation. The mining company responded negatively to the proposal and it was never built.<ref name="Hobbs" />
==Collections==
The work of Robert Smithson is held in numerous public collections around the world including the Museum of Modern Art, New York,<ref name="MoMA Collection"></ref> the Smithsonian American Art Museum,<ref name="Smithsonian"></ref> Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York,<ref name="Gugg col"></ref> the Tate Modern, London, the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York,<ref name="Whitney"></ref> among others.<ref name="Reynolds" />
==Death and legacy==
On July 20, 1973, Smithson, a photographer and the pilot died in a light aircraft crash while inspecting the site of Amarillo Ramp on the ranch of Stanley Marsh 3 near Amarillo, Texas in a Beechcraft Baron; the National Transportation Safety Board attributed the accident to the pilot's failure to maintain airspeed, with distraction being a contributing factor.<ref></ref><ref name=amarillo></ref><ref></ref> The work was subsequently completed by Smithson's widow Nancy Holt, Richard Serra and Tony Shafrazi. It was originally built to rise from a shallow artificial lake, but the lake later dried up, and the earthwork has become overgrown and eroded.<ref name=amarillo/><ref></ref>
Smithson has a following among many contemporary artists. Artists Tacita Dean, Sam Durant, Ren√©e Green, Lee Ranaldo, Vik Muniz, Mike Nelson, and the Bruce High Quality Foundation have all made homages to Smithson's works. 
In 2017 the Holt/Smithson Foundation was founded to preserve, through public service, the investigative spirit the two artists who "developed innovative methods of exploring our relationship with the planet, and expanded the limits of artistic practice." The goal of the foundation is to "increase awareness of both artists' creative legacies".<ref></ref>

In revisiting the 18th- and early 19th-century treatises of the picturesque, which Olmsted interpreted in his practice, Smithson exposes threads of an anti-aesthetic anti-formalist logic and a theoretical framework of the picturesque that addressed the dialectic between the physical landscape and its temporal context. By re-interpreting and re-valuing these treatises, Smithson was able to broaden the temporal and intellectual context for his own work, and to offer renewed meaning for Central Park as an important work of modern art and landscape architecture.<ref name="Getty symposium" />
