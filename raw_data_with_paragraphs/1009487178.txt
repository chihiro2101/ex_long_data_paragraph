Simon Weston

==Early life==
Weston was born at Caerphilly District Miners Hospital in Caerphilly. He was brought up by his mother, Pauline and adoptive father, "Lofty". His biological father served in the Royal Air Force alongside his mother. Simon lived in Singapore and at RAF Hospital Nocton Hall in Lincolnshire before returning to Nelson at the age of around six or seven.<ref name = "CatherineJones"></ref> He has one elder sister, Helen, and three stepbrothers. At the age 14, Weston was given a police caution when he was caught as a passenger in a car stolen by his older friends.<ref name=wdl></ref>
He joined the Welsh Guards in 1978 at the age of 16 at the insistence of his
mother, after he "got into bother".<ref name = "CatherineJones" /> He served in Berlin, Northern Ireland and Kenya before being deployed to the Falkland Islands.<ref name="DailyPost"></ref>
==Falklands War==
On 8 June 1982, Weston was boarded with other members of his regiment on in Port Pleasant near Fitzroy, just off the Falkland Islands. It was bombed and set on fire by the Argentine Skyhawk fighters during the Bluff Cove Air Attacks. His ship was carrying ammunition as well as phosphorus bombs and thousands of gallons of diesel and petrol.<ref name="ADSW "></ref> Out of his platoon of 30 men, 22 were killed. The Welsh Guards lost a total of 48 men killed and 97 wounded aboard the Sir Galahad.<ref name="ADSW " />
Weston survived with 46% burns, following which his face was barely recognisable: He said:
==Recovery==
Weston endured years of reconstructive surgery, including over 96 major operations or surgical procedures. Skin from his shoulders was used to make eyelids and his nose was grafted on in a later operation. He suffered psychological trauma, drinking heavily and becoming suicidal, and admits his behaviour during this time was "terrible". He credits his mother with helping him to overcome this, in particular, her act of reuniting him with his old regiment, who refused to mollycoddle him (especially Glen White, who ran the Welsh Guards rugby side), forced him to "face up to the unavoidable and to be positive about everything including especially my future".
==Television and media==
Weston has made regular contributions to radio programmes and appeared on television, especially within Wales. He has been the subject of several BBC documentaries and presented his own radio show Face for the Radio for BBC Radio Wales. He has been interviewed on many occasions for television news programmes and documentaries recounting his experiences, including appearances on 14 June 2007, the 25th anniversary of the Falklands War ending. He has also appeared on programmes such as This Is Your Life (appearing on 7 February 1990; aged still only 28, Weston was one of the show's youngest ever guests)<ref> urltoken This Is Your Life (1969–1993) @ EOFFTV .

He has written best-selling autobiographies as well as a series of novels.<ref name="simonweston.com" /> In 2003 he announced that he had been in talks over plans to make a film about his life.<ref></ref>
==Charity work==
In 1986, Weston undertook his first goodwill tour, to Australia, at the request of the Guards Association of Australasia. The resulting donations to children's burns units made him begin to feel useful again.<ref name="ADSW " />
Weston became patron of a number of charities that support people living with disfigurements,<ref name="simonweston.com" /><ref></ref> as well as the lead ambassador for The Healing Foundation.<ref></ref> He also set up a national youth charity, Weston Spirit, in 1988 with Paul Oginsky and Ben Harrison, shortly after moving to Liverpool. However, in 2008, the charity suffered from financial difficulties and had to be shut down.<ref></ref>

==Political activism==
Weston has campaigned in support of troops and veterans and against politicians' alleged failure to support them adequately.<ref></ref> He has spoken out against defence budget cuts and British troops allegedly being supplied with inadequate equipment,<ref></ref> and about the lack of support, health care and adequate compensation for veterans.<ref name="bottom"></ref> On 12 March 2007 he appeared on ITV News, giving his opinion on the care of British soldiers in hospital. On 4 March 2008, he appeared alongside Conservative leader David Cameron as he announced the formation of a commission to investigate ways to help restore the "military covenant", which Cameron called "well and truly broken".<ref></ref> It was intended that Weston would take a non-partisan, advisory role to the Commission (headed by Frederick Forsyth), with his work taking a particular focus to the treatment of veterans and the compensation paid out to injured service personnel.
It is stated that Weston is a critic of the Iraq War, believing Tony Blair's argument for invasion were invalid.<ref name="bottom" /> In February 2003, in the run up to the war, he spoke out about "politicians with so many different agendas, spin and bluff and throwing smoke in the air and I have to say even lies. so often that we are not sure what we are actually listening to now".<ref></ref>
Weston also spoke to the ethical committee at London's Royal Free Hospital in 2006 to support the case for authorising full face transplants,<ref></ref> even though he had previously been against the idea.<ref></ref>
In 2008, Weston criticised the then French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, for failing to attend a war ceremony. Weston said, "He should have got it right", "We in Wales have lost and sacrificed as much as anybody for different causes". Showing his support for the British monarchy, Weston added, "Not for a second would Charles have disrespected the event. He has always acted with a great deal of reverence for the occasion."<ref>"A snub or simply a mistake? Sarkozy 'disrespects' Wales. French president criticised for omission during war ceremony", The Western Mail. 13 November 2008. p. 3.</ref>
In February 2012 Weston was caught up in an angry exchange with actor Sean Penn, who said it was improper for Prince William to be deployed to the Falklands. Weston was reported as saying, "Sean Penn does not know what he is talking about and, frankly, he should shut up. His Penn's views are irrelevant and it only serves to fuel the fire of the Argentinians and get them more pumped up."<ref></ref>
In 2012, Weston decided to stand for the post of elected Police and Crime Commissioner for the South Wales Police. As part of the nomination process, he had to disclose the police caution he had received as a child and whether this caution disbarred him from standing became a matter of public debate. He withdrew from the process, citing this controversy and the perceived politicisation of the post (some sources hold that a caution for a juvenile should not be grounds for disqualification).<ref name=wdl /> During a BBC radio interview on the subject of the disclosure of cautions to juveniles, Weston pointed out that he has never sought to hide the caution.
==Personal life==
Weston is married to Lucy, with whom he has three children: James, Stuart and Caitlin. They met in Liverpool when she was working for his charity, Weston Spirit.<ref name = "CatherineJones" /> They were engaged on 8 June 1989, exactly seven years after the attack on the Sir Galahad. They married on 12 May 1990 and now live in Cardiff.<ref name="JulietRix"></ref>
Weston has met and become friends with First Lieutenant Carlos Cachon, the Argentine pilot who dropped the bomb which caused his injuries.<ref name="JulietRix" /> He was criticised for this by families of those who fought in the Falklands War, which he dismissed by saying "I don't have a problem with other people criticising me for things I do, as long as people understand why I did them. Then I don't have a problem to walk away and say 'you're entitled to your opinions'."<ref>Western Mail. "Weston Leads Falklands Return". 3 April 2002, p. 2.</ref>
==Honours and awards==
The medals Weston received for his military service include the General Service Medal with "Northern Ireland" clasp and the South Atlantic Medal with rosette.<ref></ref>
His courage and charity work have been recognised and honoured on a number of occasions. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1992 Birthday Honours<ref></ref> and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for charitable services.<ref></ref> In 2002 he was awarded the Freedom of the City of Liverpool.<ref></ref> In 2004, he was named one of the top 100 Welsh heroes.<ref name="WelshHeroes"></ref> In 2005 he was made an Honorary Fellow of Cardiff University.<ref></ref> In 2006 Weston and dual code (Rugby league and Rugby Union) international David Watkins were installed as patrons of the Wales Rugby League, in a ceremony held in the Welsh Assembly.
In 2008 he received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University.<ref></ref>
In September 2009 he agreed to be President Elect of the Welsh Scout Council, and was formally introduced at the Council's annual general meeting at Llandrindod Wells on 31 October.<ref></ref>
