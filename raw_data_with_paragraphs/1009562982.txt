Terence Cooke

==Early life and education==
The youngest of three children, Terence Cooke was born in New York City to Michael and Margaret (née Gannon) Cooke.<ref name=cardinals></ref> His parents were both from County Galway, Ireland, and named their son after Terence MacSwiney, the Lord Mayor of Cork who died on a hunger strike during the Irish War of Independence.<ref name=saints></ref> Michael Cooke worked as a chauffeur and construction worker.<ref name=succession></ref> At age five, Terence and his family moved from Morningside Heights, Manhattan, to the northeast Bronx. Following his mother's death in 1930, his aunt Mary Gannon helped raise him and his siblings.<ref name=saints/>
After expressing an early interest in the priesthood, in 1934 Cooke entered Manhattan's Cathedral College, the minor seminary of the Archdiocese of New York. In 1940, he entered St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers.<ref name=saints/>
==Ministry==
Cooke was ordained a priest by Archbishop Francis Spellman on December 1, 1945.<ref name=cardinals/> Cooke then served as chaplain for St. Agatha's Home for Children in Nanuet<ref name=canonization></ref> until 1947, when he moved to Washington, D.C., to pursue graduate studies at The Catholic University of America. He obtained a Master of Social Work degree in 1949.<ref name=saints/>
When he returned to New York, Cooke was assigned to serve as a curate at St. Athanasius Parish in the Bronx, while also teaching at Fordham University's School of Social Service<ref name=saints/> and working with the Catholic Youth Organization.<ref></ref> In 1954 he was appointed executive director of the Youth Division of Catholic Charities and procurator of St. Joseph's Seminary. In 1957 he was appointed by Cardinal Spellman to be his secretary, a position he held until 1965. Cooke was named a monsignor on August 13, 1957, and vice-chancellor for the archdiocese in 1958, rising to full chancellor in 1961.<ref name=cardinals/>
==Auxiliary Bishop==
On September 15, 1965, Pope Paul VI appointed Cooke as an auxiliary bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and titular bishop of Summa. He received his episcopal consecration on the following December 13 from Cardinal Spellman at St. Patrick's Cathedral, with Archbishops Joseph Thomas McGucken and John Joseph Maguire serving as Consecrator.<ref name=hierarchy/> Cooke selected as his episcopal motto: Fiat Voluntas Tua, meaning, "Thy Will Be Done" .<ref name=canonization/>
Cooke played a prominent role in arranging Pope Paul's visit to New York in October,<ref name=succession/> and became Vicar General of the Archdiocese two days after his consecration, on December 15, 1965. He was diagnosed with acute myelomonocytic leukemia, a form of cancer, that year as well.<ref name=canonization/><ref name=cancer/>
==Archbishop of New York==
Following Spellman's death in December 1967, Cooke was named the seventh Archbishop of New York on March 2, 1968.<ref name=hierarchy></ref>
Pope Paul's selection of Cooke came as a surprise; likely contenders for the post included Fulton J. Sheen, a television personality and Bishop of Rochester; and Archbishop Maguire, who had been Spellman's coadjutor but did not hold the right to succession.<ref name=succession/> In addition to his duties in New York, Cooke was named Vicar Apostolic for the U.S. Military on April 4 and was installed in both positions at St. Patrick's Cathedral.<ref name=hierarchy/>
That same day, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, leading to a nationwide wave of riots in more than 100 cities. Cooke went to Harlem that evening to plead for racial peace<ref name=saints/> and later attended King's funeral.<ref></ref> After the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, Cooke led the funeral at St. Patrick's Cathedral and later baptized Kennedy's youngest child, Rory Kennedy.<ref></ref>
In 1969, Cooke delivered the benediction at the inauguration of President Richard Nixon.
Cooke helped implement the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the archdiocese, and adopted a more collegial management style than his predecessor Spellman.<ref name=death/> Pope Paul VI created him Cardinal-Priest of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Rome (the traditional titular church of the New York archbishops starting in 1946) in the consistory of April 28, 1969.<ref name=hierarchy/> At the time of his elevation, he was the second-youngest member of the College of Cardinals after Alfred Bengsch, who was six months younger. Cooke was theologically conservative but progressive in secular matters.<ref name=succession/>
During his tenure as archbishop, Cooke founded Birthright, which offers women alternatives to abortion; the Inner-City Scholarship Fund, which provides financial aid for Catholic-school students; an Archdiocesan Housing Development Program, providing housing to New York's disadvantaged; urltoken Catholic New York, the archdiocesan newspaper; and nine nursing homes.<ref name=canonization/> In 1974, he went to the Pontifical North American College in Rome, where he attended lectures on the Second Vatican Council given by his future successor Edward Egan.<ref></ref>
Cooke was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the conclaves of August and October 1978, which selected Pope John Paul I and John Paul II, respectively. In 1979, Cooke separately hosted the Dalai Lama<ref name=lama></ref> and Pope John Paul II at St. Patrick's Cathedral.
==Illness and death==
Cooke's leukemia, first diagnosed in 1965, was deemed terminal in 1975,<ref name=canonization/> and he was on almost constant chemotherapy for the last five years of his life.<ref name=close></ref> In late August 1983, he announced his illness to the public, saying that he was expected to live for a few more months but would not resign his post.<ref name=cancer></ref> In an open letter completed only days before his death, he wrote, "The gift of life, God's special gift, is no less beautiful when it is accompanied by illness or weakness, hunger or poverty, mental or physical handicaps, loneliness or old age."<ref name=death></ref>
On October 6, 1983, Cooke died from leukemia at age 62 at his episcopal residence in Manhattan, New York City. He is interred in the crypt under the altar of St. Patrick's Cathedral.<ref name=cardinals/><ref></ref>

==Cause for canonization==
Cooke was regarded as a holy person by many New Yorkers during his ministry as archbishop. Soon after he died in 1983, a movement emerged to canonize him as a saint. In 1984, with the support of Cooke's successor, Archbishop (and future cardinal) John Joseph O'Connor, the Cardinal Cooke Guild was established. In 1992, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints officially designated Cooke as a Servant of God, the first step in the process that leads to beatification and then canonization as a saint. On April 14, 2010, the Guild and senior American clergy presented Pope Benedict XVI with the positio, the documentation of the cardinal's life, work, and virtues. The document was then filed with the Congregation for Causes, to be examined by theologians.<ref></ref> If the document is approved, Cooke will receive the title of Venerable, the second step leading to sainthood.
Benedict Groeschel was the postulator for the cause while it was in its initial stages in New York. Since the process was accepted by the Holy See, Andrea Ambrosi has served in that position.<ref name=canonization/>
