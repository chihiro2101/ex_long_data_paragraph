Concentration of media ownership

==Mergers==
merger are a result of one media related company buying another company for control of their resources in order to increase revenues and viewership. As information and entertainment become a major part of our culture, media companies have been creating ways to become more efficient in reaching viewers and turning a profit. Successful media companies usually buy out other companies to make them more powerful, profitable, and able to reach a larger viewing audience. Media mergers have become more prevalent in recent years, which has people wondering about the negative effects that could be caused by media ownership becoming more concentrated. Such negative effects that could come into play are lack of competition and diversity as well as biased political views.<ref name="globalissues.org"></ref>
Steven Rattner an expert in the field of media mergers and acquisitions who is a professional investment banker stated that "we are entering what may will prove to be the golden age of competition in communications industries." <ref></ref> The idea of media merger is a relatively new concept that we will continue to see affect the impact and spread of communication.
There have been 5 prominent media mergers that have truly restructured the world of media as we know it.
Fox Business states that these are the 5 biggest media mergers of all time:
The biggest media merger of all time is AOL which bought control over Time Warner Incorporated in the year of 2000 on January 10 for a total of 112 billion dollars.
The second biggest media merger of all time is AT&T buying control over WarnerMedia Incorporated once again this time in the year of 2016 on October 22 for a total of 101 billion dollars.
The third biggest media merger of all time is Charter Communications buying control over Time Warner Incorporated for the 3rd time in the year of 2015 on May 26 for a total of 87.4 Billion dollars.
The fourth largest media merger of all time is Walt Disney Company buying control over 21st Century Fox Incorporated the sector of their entertainment business in the year of 2017 on December 14 for a total of 84.8 Billion dollars.
The fifth largest media merger of all time is AT&T buying control over direcTV in the year of 2014 on May 18 for a total of 66.5 Billion dollars.
=== Media oligopoly ===
An oligopoly is when a few firms dominate a market.<ref name="Straubhaar, Joseph 2008">Straubhaar, Joseph, Robert LaRose, and Lucinda Davenport. Media Now: Understanding Media, Culture, and Technology. Wadsworth Pub Co, 2008. Print.</ref> The term oligopoly comes from the phrase oligarchy. Merriam Webster- Dictionary defines oligarchy as "a government in which a small group exercises control especially for corrupt and selfish purposes" So, When the larger scale media companies buy out the more smaller-scaled or local companies they become more powerful within the market. As they continue to eliminate their business competition through buyouts or forcing them out (because they lack the resources or finances) the companies left dominate the media industry and create a media oligopoly.<ref name="globalissues.org"/>
=== Risks for media integrity ===
Media integrity is at risk when small number of companies and individuals control the media market. Media integrity refers to the ability of a media outlet to serve the public interest and democratic process, making it resilient to institutional corruption within the media system, economy of influence, conflicting dependence and political clientelism.<ref></ref> Media integrity is especially endangered in the case when there are Clientelism relations between the owners of the media and political centres of power. Such a situation enables excessive instrumentalisation of the media for particular political interests, which is subversive for the Media democracy.
=== Elimination of net neutrality ===
Net neutrality is also at stake when media mergers occur. Net neutrality involves a lack of restrictions on content on the internet, however, with big businesses supporting campaigns financially they tend to have influence over political issues, which can translate into their mediums. These big businesses that also have control over internet usage or the airwaves could possibly make the content available biased from their political stand point or they could restrict usage for conflicting political views, therefore eliminating net neutrality.<ref name="Straubhaar, Joseph 2008"/>
There was considerable discussion of net neutrality in late 2017. The concerns continue but do not still have the presence on social media. Net neutrality is already a fragile and sought after commodity than many regions do not have access to. "See, net neutrality keeps internet providers in check, if you will. Without net neutrality, there would be a sort of monopoly over the internet, and rather than having the freedom to roar just about any and every inch of the online world, companies could start to dictate where you are allowed to go." urltoken 
==Issues==
Concentration of media ownership is very frequently seen as a problem of contemporary media and society.<ref name="New Internationalist"></ref><ref name="newint.org"></ref><ref name="Katharine Ainger"></ref> When media ownership is concentrated in one or more of the ways mentioned above, a number of undesirable consequences follow, including the following:
* Commercially driven, ultra-powerful Mass media is primarily loyal to sponsors, i.e. advertisers and government rather than to the public interest.
* Only a few companies representing the interests of a minority elite control the public airwaves.
* Healthy, market-based competition is absent, leading to slower innovation and increased prices.
=== Diversity of viewpoints ===
It is important to elaborate upon the issue of media consolidation and its effect upon the diversity of information reaching a particular market. Critics of consolidation raise the issue of whether monopolistic or oligopolistic control of a local media market can be fully accountable and dependable in serving the public interest.
=== Freedom of the press and editorial independence ===
On the local end, reporters have often seen their stories refused or edited beyond recognition. An example would be the repeated refusal of networks to air "ads" from anti-war advocates to liberal groups like MoveOn.org, or religious groups like the United Church of Christ, regardless of factual basis. Journalists and their reports may be directly sponsored by parties who are the subject of their journalism leading to reports which actually favor the sponsor, have that appearance, or are simply a repetition of the sponsors' opinion.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
Consequently, if the companies dominating a media market choose to suppress stories that do not serve their interests, the public suffers, since they are not adequately informed of some crucial issues that may affect them.
Concern among academia rests in the notion that the purpose of the First Amendment to the US constitution was to encourage a free press as political agitator evidenced by the famous quote from US President Thomas Jefferson, "The only security of all is in a free press. The force of public opinion cannot be resisted when permitted freely to be expressed. The agitation it produces must be submitted to. It is necessary, to keep the waters pure."<ref></ref> Freedom of the press has long been combated by large media companies, but their objections have just as long been dismissed by the supreme courts.<ref></ref>
Recently, new age critical scholarship has emerged that has investigated policymaking critical junctures in the communicative history in northern America. As a result, the media reform movement has flourished. The five core truths have emanated from this movement that analyze and directs progressive forces in this critical juncture.<ref>Barron, Jerome A. "Freedom of the Press for Whom? The Question to be Answered in our Critical Juncture."Freedom of the Press for Whom? the Right of Access to Mass Media. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1973. N. pag. Print.</ref>
=== Deregulation ===
One explanation for the cause of the concentration of media ownership is a shift to neoliberal deregulation policies, which is a market-driven approach. Deregulation effectively removes governmental barriers to allow for the commercial exploitation of media. Motivation for media firms to merge includes increased profit-margins, reduced risk and maintaining a competitive edge. In contrast to this, those who support deregulation have argued that cultural trade barriers and regulations harm consumers and domestic support in the form of subsidies hinders countries to develop their own strong media firms. The opening of borders is more beneficial to countries than maintaining protectionist regulations.<ref></ref>
Critics of media deregulation and the resulting concentration of ownership fear that such trends will only continue to reduce the diversity of information provided, as well as to reduce the accountability of information providers to the public. The ultimate consequence of consolidation, critics argue, is a poorly informed public, restricted to a reduced array of media options that offer only information that does not harm the media oligopoly's growing range of interests.<ref></ref>
For those critics, media deregulation is a dangerous trend, facilitating an increase in concentration of media ownership, and subsequently reducing the overall quality and diversity of information communicated through major media channels. Increased concentration of media ownership can lead to corporate censorship affecting a wide range of critical thought.<ref></ref>
=== Other ===
Another concern is that consolidated media is not flexible enough to serve local communities in case of emergency or that corporate "cost-cutting practices have undermined public safety".<ref name=radioworldMinot></ref> For instance, some say that the Minot train derailment was exacerbated by consolidation of media, but the Emergency Alert System (EAS) – which is completely automated once activated – was not activated by emergency management officials because they were not aware that or how they could.<ref name=radioworldMinot /> After a similar train accident in Macdona, Texas in June 2004, the EAS was again not activated but a commercial radio station in San Antonio provided emergency information as they received it because they were monitoring police scanner traffic.<ref name=radioworldMinot /><ref name="MustoePartIII"></ref><ref name="MustoeEAS2005"></ref> Another train accident (in Graniteville, S.C., in January 2005) also resulted in EAS activation failures to the local stations despite their monitoring the appropriate channels.<ref name=radioworldMinot /> All these incidents indicate that their EAS failures didn't come primarily from consolidated media.<ref name=radioworldMinot />
====American public distrust in the media====
A 2012 Gallup poll found that Americans' distrust in the mass media had hit a new high, with 60% saying they had little or no trust in the mass media to report the news fully, accurately, and fairly. Distrust has steadily increased since 2004, when Americans were already more negative about the media than they had been in years prior.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
A recent study has concluded that group participation contributes to the public perceptions of the legitimacy or credibility of mass media. Accordingly, high involvement in media incites more scrutiny and more biased scrutiny of media content.<ref></ref>
== Media pluralism ==
The concentration of media ownership is commonly regarded as one of the crucial aspects reducing media pluralism. A high concentration of the media market increases the chances to reduce the plurality of political, cultural and social points of views.<ref name=CMPF></ref>
Even if ownership of the media is one of the main concerns when it comes to assessing media pluralism, the concept of media pluralism is broader as it touches many aspects, from merger control rules to editorial freedom, the status of public service broadcasters, the working conditions of journalists, the relationship between media and politics, representation of local and regional communities and the inclusion of minorities' voices.<ref name=CMPF/> Also, it embraces all measures guaranteeing citizens' access to diversified sources so to allow the formation of a plurality of opinions in the public sphere without undue influence of dominant powers.
Furthermore, media pluralism has a two-fold dimension, or rather internal and external. Internal pluralism concerns pluralism within a specific media organisation: in this regard, many countries request public broadcast services to account for a variety of views and opinions, including those of minority groups. External pluralism applies instead to the overall media landscape, for instance in terms of the number of media outlets operating in a given country.<ref name="ec.europa.eu"> urltoken A Free and pluralistic media to sustain European democracy. The report of the High Level Group on Media Freedom and Pluralism, European Commission, January 2013. Retrieved 14 June 2016.</ref>
Media ownership can pose serious challenges to pluralism when owners interfere with journalists' independence and editorial line. However, in a free market economy, owners must have the capacity to decide the strategy of their company to remain competitive in the market. Also, pluralism does not mean neutrality and lack of opinion, as having an editorial line is an integral part of the role of editors provided that this line is transparent and explicit to both the staff and audience.<ref name="ec.europa.eu"/>
=== Determinants of media pluralism ===
====Size and wealth of the market====
"Within any free market economy, the level of resources available for the provision of media will be constrained principally by the size and wealth of that economy, and the propensity of its inhabitants to consume media." Gillian Doyle; 2002:15 Those countries that have a relatively large market, like the United Kingdom, France or Spain have more financial background to support diversity of output and have the ability to keep more media companies in the market (as they are there to make profit). More diverse output and fragmented ownership will, obviously, support pluralism. In contrast, small markets like Ireland or Hungary suffer from the absence of the diversity of output given in countries with bigger markets. It means that "support for the media through direct payment" and "levels of consumers expenditure", furthermore "the availability of advertising support" Gillian Doyle; 2002:15 are less in these countries, due to the low number of audience. Overall, the size and wealth of the market determine the diversity of both media output and media ownership.
====Diversity of suppliers/owners====
From the previous paragraph it can be assumed that size/wealth of the market have a very strong relation to the diversity of supplier. If the first is not given (wealthy market) then it is difficult to achieve a fragmented supplier system. Diversity of suppliers refers to those heterogeneous independent organizations that are involved in media production and to the common ownership as well. The more various suppliers there are, the better for pluralism is. However, "the more powerful individual suppliers become, the greater the potential threat to pluralism".<ref>Doyle, 2002: p. 18</ref>
====Consolidation of resources====
The consolidation of cost functions and cost-sharing. Cost-sharing is a common practice in monomedia and cross media. For example, "for multi-product television or radio broadcasters, the more homogeneity possible between different services held in common ownership (or the more elements within a programme schedule which can be shared between 'different' stations), the greater the opportunity to reap economies".<ref>Doyle, 2002: p. 22–23</ref> Though the main concern of pluralism is that different organization under different ownership may buy the same e.g. news stories from the same news-supplier agency. In the UK, the biggest news-supplier is The Press Association (PA). Here is a quoted text from PA web site: "The Press Association supplies services to every national and regional daily newspaper, major broadcasters, online publishers and a wide range of commercial organisations." Overall, in a system where all different media organizations gather their stories from the same source, we can't really call that system pluralist. That is where diversity of output comes in.<ref></ref>
=== Pluralism in media ownership ===
Media privatization and the lessening of state dominance over media content has continued since 2012. In the Arab world, the Arab States Broadcasting Union (ASBU) counted 1,230 television stations broadcasting via Arab and international satellites, of which 133 were state-owned and 1,097 private.<ref>Arab States Broadcasting Union. 2015. Arab Satellite Broadcasting Annual Report 2015. Available at <<nowiki> urltoken NewMedia_2016/text/asbu_report_2015. pdf>.</ref> According to the ASBU Report, these numbers serve as evidence of a decline in the percentage of state channels and a rise in national private and foreign public stations targeting the Arab region. The reduction of direct government ownership over the whole media sector is commonly registered as a positive trend, but this has paralleled by a growth in outlets with a sectarian agenda.<ref name=":0"></ref>
In Africa, some private media outlets have maintained close ties to governments or individual politicians, while media houses owned by politically non-aligned individuals have struggled to survive, often in the face of advertising boycotts by state agencies. In almost all regions, models of Public broadcasting have been struggling for funding. In Western, Central and Eastern Europe, funds directed to public service broadcasting have been stagnating or declining since 2012.<ref>European Broadcasting Union (EBU). 2015. Funding of Public Service Media 2015. Available at <<nowiki> urltoken publications/funding-of-public-servicemedia>.</ref>
New types of Cross ownership have emerged in the past five years that have spurred new questions about where to draw the line between media and other industries. A notable case has been the acquisition of the Washington Post by the founder of online retailer Amazon. While the move initially raised concerns about the newspaper's independence, the newspaper has significantly increased its standing in the online media—and print—and introduced significant innovations.<ref name=":0" />
The community-centred media ownership model continues to survive in some areas, especially in isolated, rural or disadvantaged areas, and mostly pertaining to radio. Through this model, not-for-profit media outlets are run and managed by the communities they serve.<ref name=":0" />
=== Newspaper and Advertising ===
Media ownership avoid news which is critical of advertisers. Cater to the interests of prized demographics. Producing news which puts audiences in a "buying mood" as consumers.
==In particular nations==
===Australia===
Controls over media ownership in Australia are laid down in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992,<ref>.</ref> administered by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). Even with laws in place Australia has a high concentration of media ownership. Ownership of national and the newspapers of each capital city are dominated by two corporations, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Australia, (which was founded in Adelaide as News Limited) and Nine Entertainment Co. These two corporations along with Seven West Media co-own Australian Associated Press which distributes the news and then sells it on to other outlets such as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Although much of the everyday mainstream news is drawn from the Australian Associated Press, all the privately owned media outlets still compete with each other for exclusive pop culture news.
Rural and regional media is dominated by Australian Community Media, with significant holdings in all states and territories.
Daily Mail and General Trust operate the DMG Radio Australia commercial radio networks in metropolitan and regional areas of Australia. Formed in 1996, it has since become one of the largest radio media companies in the country. The company currently own more than 60 radio stations across New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia.
There are rules governing foreign ownership of Australian media and these rules were loosened by the former Howard Government.
According to Reporters Without Borders in 2004, Australia is in 41st position on a list of countries ranked by Press Freedom; well behind New Zealand (9th) and United Kingdom (28th). This ranking is primarily due to the limited diversity in media ownership. By 2013, Australia had risen to 26th on the Press Freedom Index.
Media Watch is an independent media watchdog televised on the public broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), which is one of two government-administered channels, the other being Special Broadcasting Service (SBS).
In late 2011, the Finkelstein Inquiry into media regulation was launched, and reported its findings back to the federal government in early 2012.<ref> urltoken Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy - Independent Media Inquiry </ref>
===New Zealand===
Independent Newspapers (INL) formerly published the Wellington-based newspapers The Dominion and The Evening Post, in addition to purchasing a large shareholding in pay TV broadcaster Sky Media Limited in 1997. These two newspapers merged to form the Dominion Post in 2002, and in 2003, sold its entire print media division to Fairfax New Zealand. The remainder of the company officially merged with Sky Media Limited in 2005 to form Sky Network Television Limited.
When INL ceased publishing the Auckland Star in 1991, The New Zealand Herald became the Auckland region's sole daily newspaper. The New Zealand Herald and the New Zealand Listener, formerly privately held by the Wilson & Horton families, was sold to APN News & Media in 1996. The long-running news syndication agency NZPA announced that it would close down in 2011, with operations to be taken over by 3 separate agencies, APN's APNZ, Fairfax's FNZN and AAP's NZN, all owned by Australian parent companies.<ref></ref> In 2014, APN's New Zealand division officially changed its name to NZME, in order to reflect the company's convergence with its radio division The Radio Network. As of early 2015, Fairfax New Zealand and NZME have a near duopoly on newspapers and magazines in New Zealand. In May 2016, NZME and Fairfax NZ announced merger talks, pending Commerce Commission approval.<ref></ref>
Commercial radio stations are largely divided up between MediaWorks New Zealand and NZME, with MediaWorks also owning TV3 and C4 (now The Edge TV). TVNZ, although 100% state-owned, has been run on an almost entirely commercial basis since the late 1980s, in spite of previous attempts to steer it towards a more Public broadcasting role. Its primary public-service outlet, TVNZ7, ceased broadcasting in 2012 due to non-renewal of funding, and the youth-oriented TVNZ6 was rebranded as the short-lived commercial channel TVNZ U. In addition, the TVNZ channels Kidzone (and formerly TVNZ Heartland) are only available through Sky Network Television and not on the Freeview platform.<ref></ref>
Sky Network Television has had an effective monopoly on pay TV in New Zealand since its nearest rival Saturn Communications (later part of TelstraClear and now Vodafone New Zealand) began wholesaling Sky content in 2002. However, in 2011, TelstraClear CEO Allan Freeth warned it would review its wholesale agreement with Sky unless it allowed TelstraClear to purchase non-Sky content.<ref></ref>
===Canada===
Canada has the biggest concentrated TV ownership out of all the G8 countries and it comes in second place for the most concentrated television viewers.<ref></ref>
Broadcasting and telecommunications in Canada are regulated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), an independent governing agency that aims to serve the needs and interests of citizens, industries, interest groups and the government. The CRTC does not regulate newspapers or magazines.<ref></ref>
Apart from a relatively small number of Community radio, media in Canada are primarily owned by a small number of groups, including Bell Canada, the Shaw family (via Corus Entertainment and Shaw Communications), Rogers Communications, Quebecor, and the government-owned CBC/Radio-Canada. Each of these companies holds a diverse mix of television, specialty television, and radio operations. Bell, Rogers, Shaw, and Quebecor also engage in the telecommunications industry with their ownership of internet providers, television providers, and mobile carriers, while Rogers is also involved in publishing.
In 2007, CTVglobemedia, Rogers Media and Quebecor all expanded significantly through the acquisitions of CHUM Limited, CityTV and Osprey Media, respectively. In 2010, Canwest Global Communications, having filed for bankruptcy, sold its television assets to Shaw (through a new subsidiary, Shaw Media) and spun off its newspaper holdings into Postmedia Network, a new company founded by the National Posts CEO Paul Godfrey.<ref></ref> Later that year, Bell also announced that it would acquire the remaining shares of CTVglobemedia (which was originally majority owned by Bell when it was formed in 2001; Bell had reduced its stake in the following years), forming Bell Media.<ref name="CTV-purchase"></ref>
Between 1990 and 2005 there were a number of media corporate mergers and takeovers in Canada. For example, in 1990, 17.3% of daily newspapers were independently owned; whereas in 2005, 1% were.<ref></ref> These changes, among others, caused the Senate Standing Committee on Transport and Communications to launch a study of Canadian news media in March 2003. (This topic had been examined twice in the past, by the Davey Commission (1970) and the Kent Commission (1981), both of which produced recommendations that were never implemented in any meaningful way.)<ref name="The Globe and Mail"></ref><ref name="Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications"></ref>
The Senate Committee's final report, released in June 2006, expressed concern about the effects of the current levels of news media ownership in Canada. Specifically, the committee discussed their concerns regarding the following trends: the potential of media ownership concentration to limit news diversity and reduce news quality; the CRTC and Competition Bureau's ineffectiveness at stopping media ownership concentration; the lack of federal funding for the CBC and the broadcaster's uncertain mandate and role; diminishing employment standards for journalists (including less job security, less journalistic freedom, and new contractual threats to intellectual property); a lack of Canadian training and research institutes; and difficulties with the federal government's support for print media and the absence of funding for the internet-based news media.<ref name="The Globe and Mail"/><ref name="Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications"/>
The Senate report expressed particular concern about the concentration of ownership in the province of New Brunswick, where the Irving business empire owns all the English-language daily newspapers and most of the weeklies. Senator Joan Fraser, author of the report, stated, "We didn't find anywhere else in the developed world a situation like the situation in New Brunswick."<ref name="CBC"></ref>
The report provided 40 recommendations and 10 suggestions (for areas outside of federal government jurisdiction), including legislation amendments that would trigger automatic reviews of a proposed media merger if certain thresholds are reached, and CRTC regulation revisions to ensure that access to the broadcasting system is encouraged and that a diversity of news and information programming is available through these services.<ref name="The Globe and Mail"/><ref name="Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications"/>
Public inquires into the concentration of ownership and its impact upon democracy. The Canadian regulatory framework imposes requirements upon the protection and enhancement of Canadian culture (through regulation, subsidies and the operation of the CBC). Increasing acceptance of media/news as commercial enterprise in 1990s driven by: hegemony of new-liberalism, role of commodified information technology in economic growth, commitment to private sector "champions" of Canadian culture.
===Brazil===
In Brazil, the concentration of media ownership seems to have manifested itself very early. Dr. Venício A. de Lima noted in 2003:
*Before the second merger of Viacom and CBS, CBS has also recently spun off its CBS Radio, causing them to merge with Entercom.
News Corporation was split into two separate companies on June 28, 2013, with publishing assets and Australian media assets going to a spin-off known as News Corp, and broadcasting and media assets going to 21st Century Fox. Both companies remain under the control of Rupert Murdoch, although Murdoch has reduced involvement in the new News Corp.<ref name=bbc-splitofficial></ref> Most of 21st Century Fox's properties are now owned by the Walt Disney Company (through their acquisition of the company), while others have gone into the newly founded Fox Corporation, or sold to other companies.
=== Venezuela ===
About 70% of Venezuelan TV and radio stations are privately owned, while only about 5% or less of these stations are currently state-owned. The remaining stations are mostly community owned. VTV was the only state TV channel in Venezuela only about a decade ago. For the last decade, through the present day, the Venezuelan government operates and owns five more stations.<ref name="Howard"></ref>
Commercial outlets completely rule over the radio sector. However, the Venezuelan government funds a good number of radio shows and TV stations. The primary newspapers of Venezuela are private companies that are frequently condemning of their government. These newspapers being produced in Venezuela do not have a large following.<ref name="Howard"/>

Concentration of media ownership (also known as media consolidation or media convergence) is a process whereby progressively fewer individuals or organizations control increasing shares of the mass media.<ref>Steven, 2009: p. 19</ref> Contemporary research demonstrates increasing levels of consolidation, with many media industries already highly concentrated and oligopoly.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
Globally, large media conglomerates include Bertelsmann, National Amusements (ViacomCBS), Sony, News Corp, Comcast, The Walt Disney Company, AT&T, Fox Corporation, Hearst Communications, MGM Holdings, Grupo Globo (South America), and Lagardère Group.<ref name="New Internationalist"/><ref name="newint.org"/><ref name="Katharine Ainger"/>
As of 2020, the largest media conglomerates in terms of revenue are Comcast, The Walt Disney Company, AT&T, and ViacomCBS, per Forbes.
In nations described as authoritarian by most international think-tanks and NGOs, media ownership is generally something very close to the state monopoly over information in direct or indirect ways.
