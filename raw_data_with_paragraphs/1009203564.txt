VVD is a member of the Liberal International and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party.

The PvdA is generally supportive of European integration. Although called the Labour Party, it has no formal links to the trade unions. In practice, however, strong links exist, with PvdA politicians often beginning their careers in the FNV trade union. The party is led by Lilianne Ploumen. The PvdA was a member of the Socialist International until it delisted in 2014.<ref> urltoken </ref> Nowadays the party is a member of the Progressive Alliance and the Party of European Socialists.

* The Socialist Party (SP) is a left-wing populism party.<ref></ref> In the 1970s and 1980s, it was a Maoism party supported by the People's Republic of China (PRC).

The party itself has called it a move "from socialism to a social-ism." The party opposes what it sees as the European Superstate. The SP operated as an independent party within the European United Left-Nordic Green Left group until the 2019 European elections, when it lost all seats in the European Parliament. Lilian Marijnissen is the leader of the SP.

This article lists political parties in the Netherlands, which has a multi-party system with numerous political parties, in which any one party has little chance of gaining power alone, and parties often work with each other to form coalition governments.
The lower house of the legislature, the House of Representatives, is elected by a national party-list system of proportional representation. There is no threshold for getting a seat, making it possible for a party to get a seat with only two-thirds percent of the vote—roughly one seat for every 67,000 votes.
No party has won a majority of seats since the election of 1894,<ref name=NS>Dieter Nohlen & Philip Stöver (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p1412 </ref> and no party has even approached the seats needed for a majority since the current proportional representation system was implemented in 1918. All Dutch governments since then have been coalitions between two or more parties. However, there is a broad consensus on the basic principles of the political system, and all parties must adjust their goals to some extent in order to have a realistic chance at being part of the government.
