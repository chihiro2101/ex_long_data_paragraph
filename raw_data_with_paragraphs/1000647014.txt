===Early years===
Stephen Hartley began brewing in Tadcaster in 1758.<ref name=taddyhistory/> Jane Hartley mortgaged the brewery to David Backhouse and John Hartley in 1845.<ref name=taddyhistory/> Samuel Smith of Leeds arranged for his son John to enter the business in 1847.<ref name=taddyhistory/> Jane Hartley died in 1852, and John Smith acquired the business, enlisting his brother William to assist.<ref name=taddyhistory/> The timing was to prove fortuitous; pale ales were displacing porter as the beer of choice, and Tadcaster's hard water proved to be well-suited for brewing the new style.<ref name="GourvishWilson2003"></ref> The prosperity of the 1850s and 1860s, together with the arrival of the railways, realised greater opportunities for brewers, and John Smith employed eight men in his brewing and malting enterprise by 1861.<ref name=ODNB1> </ref>

The firm expanded throughout the 1880s by creating an agency network, establishing sixteen offices in nearby settlements, and offering free trade discounts on their beer of 20 percent or higher.<ref name=ODNB1/> The brewery had an annual output of 150,000 barrels by 1889.<ref></ref> In 1889, the company's first scientifically-trained head brewer was appointed, Percy Clinch, son of Charles Clinch of the Eagle Brewery in Witney.<ref name=hundred8></ref> In 1892, the partnership became a limited company called John Smith's Tadcaster Brewery Company Limited, with Henry Herbert Riley-Smith as chairman.<ref name=autogenerated3></ref> In 1899 the company acquired Simpson & Co of Market Weighton, with 51 public houses, and converted the brewery into a maltings.<ref name=leedsmerc></ref><ref name=ellis2></ref>

The last of the company's dray horses was retired in 1947.<ref name=hundred7 /> Horses had delivered beer to all the areas surrounding the brewery, as far afield as Pateley Bridge.<ref name=hundred7 /> From 1948 the company exported beer to Belgium where it was bottled and distributed by Tilkens brewery.<ref name=econ5></ref> In 1950 there was a Royal Question in Belgium, and John Smith's hired two Handley Page Halifax heavy bomber aircraft to carry 7 ton loads twice-daily of their beers into the country in order to ensure supply.<ref name=ellis5></ref> In 1953 the firm became a public company, with fixed assets of around £5 million, 1,000 licensed premises and around 1,100 employees.<ref name=times2></ref> In 1958, Whitworth, Son & Nephew of Wath-upon-Dearne was acquired with 165 licensed houses, and the brewery was immediately closed down.<ref name=times3></ref> In 1959 the company began to bottle imported Alken lager at Tadcaster, in response to growing customer demand.<ref name=econ8></ref> In 1961 the company also began to bottle Carlsberg lager.<ref></ref> By 1960 the company had an estate of 909 public houses.<ref name=mutch></ref>

== Advertising ==
The Magnet trademark was first registered in September 1908 in Brussels, and symbolised strength.<ref name="Sunderland2010"></ref>
The company's association with television advertising began in 1971 with the "Yorkshiremen love it" campaign.<ref name=adage1></ref>
This was followed by the "Big John" campaign, which ran in the North of England from 1981, and centred around a re-writing of the Big Bad John country music staple.<ref name="eha">"Selling pitches."

=== No Nonsense campaigns ===

Dee resigned in 1997, and he was replaced in 1998 with a cardboard cut-out known as the "No Nonsense Man", from the GGT advertising agency.<ref name="AngwinCummings2011" /> Despite appearing in over 20,000 pubs, clubs and shops, No Nonsense Man was found to have less of an impact than the Dee advertisements.<ref name="adage1"/><ref name="AngwinCummings2011" />

John Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England, produces beers including John Smith's, the highest selling bitter in the United Kingdom since the mid-1990s.
The majority of John Smith's sales are of the nitrogenated Extra Smooth product, although a cask conditioned variant is available nationally. A stronger variant called Magnet is also available in the North East of England. John Smith's Cask and Magnet are produced under licence by Cameron's in Hartlepool.
John Smith acquired the Backhouse & Hartley brewery in 1852. Following a series of acquisitions in the post-World War II period, the company became one of the largest regional brewers in the country, operating over 1,800 licensed premises. The company was taken over by Courage in 1970 who extended distribution of the brewery's products into the South of England. Courage was acquired by Scottish & Newcastle in 1995, and the operations were purchased by Heineken in 2008.
John Smith's Extra Smooth and Original are produced at the Tadcaster brewery, as well as a range of Heineken products including Amstel and Kronenbourg 1664. With a 38 million litre capacity, the brewery is one of the largest in the country.
John Smith's became well known for a series of highly successful "No Nonsense"-themed television advertising campaigns, featuring the dour Yorkshireman character "Arkwright" during the 1970s and 1980s (shown only in the South of England), followed by the comedians Jack Dee during the 1990s and Peter Kay since 2002. The brand also has an association with horse racing: it was the principal sponsor of the Grand National between 2005 and 2013, the Northumberland Plate from 2003 until 2016, and has sponsored the John Smith's Cup since 1960.
