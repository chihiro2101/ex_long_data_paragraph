Tullia gens

==Origin==
The nomen Tullius is a patronymic surname, derived from the old Latin praenomen Tullus, probably from a root meaning to support, bear, or help.<ref>Chase, pp. 145, 146.</ref> The Tullii of the Republic sometimes claimed descent from Servius Tullius, the sixth King of Rome, who according to some traditions was the son of Servius Tullius, a prince of Corniculum who was slain in battle against the Romans under Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, the fifth Roman king.<ref>Cicero, Brutus, 62, Tusculanae Quaestiones, i. 16.</ref> However, the Roman historians report that the Tullii were one of the Alban noble families that came to Rome after the destruction of their city during the reign of Tullus Hostilius, the third King of Rome.<ref>Livy, i. 30.</ref> This would probably make the Tullii one of the gentes minores, the lesser patrician houses of the Republic.<ref name="DGRBM Tullia Gens"/><ref>Wiseman, "Legendary Genealogies", p. 158.</ref>
==Praenomina==
The main praenomina used by the Tullii were Marcus and Lucius. To these, the Tullii Cicerones added Quintus. Manius is found only among the patrician Tullii at the beginning of the Republic, and there are individual instances of Sextus and Tiberius.
==Branches and cognomina==
The patrician Tullii bore the cognomen Longus, tall, but only one of them appears in history.<ref>Chase, p. 110.</ref> The notable plebeian families bore the surnames Decula and Cicero. The latter, among the most famous of Roman cognomina, belongs to a common class of surnames derived from familiar objects.<ref>Chase, p. 113.</ref> This family came from Arpino, the inhabitants of which were granted Roman citizenship in 188 BC. Plutarch reports that the surname was given to an ancestor of the orator, who had a cleft in the tip of his nose in the shape of a chickpea, or cicer. At the beginning of his career, Cicero was urged to adopt a more auspicious surname, but he declined, stating that he would make the name famous.<ref>Plutarch, The Life of Cicero, 1.</ref> Most other surnames found with the Tullii of the Republic belonged to freedmen, but a number of the family bore no cognomen.<ref name="DGRBM Tullia Gens"/><ref>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, pp. 707, 708 ("Cicero").</ref>

===Early Tullii===
* Servius Tullius, according to one tradition, the prince of Corniculum, husband of Ocrisia, and father of Servius Tullius, the sixth King of Rome, fell in battle when Corniculum was taken by Lucius Tarquinius Priscus.<ref>Livy, i. 39.</ref><ref>Dionysius, iv. 1, 2.</ref>
* Servius Tullius, the sixth King of Rome, traditionally reigned from 578 to 534 BC. He is said to have defeated Veii, enlarged the sacred boundary of Rome, and enclosed the city with a stone wall, established the Temple of Diana, and an alliance with the Latins, and undertook significant reforms of the Roman constitution, establishing the Comitia Centuriata and the Servian tribes.<ref>Ovid, Fasti, vi. 573 ff, 625 ff.</ref><ref>Valerius Maximus, i. 8 § 11.</ref><ref>Dionysius, iv. 1–40.</ref><ref>Cicero, De Republica, ii. 21, 22.</ref><ref>Livy, i. 39–48.</ref><ref>Zonaras, vii. 9.</ref><ref>Niebuhr, History of Rome, vol. i, pp. 249, 398 ff.</ref><ref>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, pp. 1184–1190 ("Servius Tullius").</ref>
* Marcus Tullius, a duumvir sacris faciundis in the reign of Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last King of Rome, was paid by a certain Petronius Sabinus to allow him to copy one of the Sibylline books. The king punished Tullius by having him sewn into a leather sack, and cast into the sea.<ref>Valerius Maximus, i. 1. § 13.</ref><ref>Dionysius, iv. 62.</ref>
* Manius Tullius Longus, consul in 500 BC, besieged the city of Fidenae when its inhabitants revolted, but withdrew his army when the Fidenates sought to negotiate a peace. He and his colleague then suppressed a conspiracy to restore the Tarquins. While opening the Ludi Romani, Tullius was badly injured when he fell from his chariot. He died three days later.<ref>Livy, ii. 19.</ref><ref>Dionysius, v. 52–57.</ref><ref>Zonaras, vii. 13.</ref><ref>Cicero, Brutus, 16.</ref>
* Manius Tullius Tolerinus, according to Festus, one of several persons burned at the Circus Maximus in 486 BC, possibly on the charge of conspiring with Spurius Cassius Viscellinus.<ref>Festus, 180 L.</ref><ref>Valerius Maximus, vi. 3. § 2.</ref><ref name="Broughton I 21"/>
* Attius Tullius, a leader of the Volscians early in the fifth century BC, who gave shelter to Gaius Marcius Coriolanus following his exile from Rome, and encouraged him to take up arms against the Romans.<ref>Livy, ii. 35–40.</ref><ref>Dionysius, viii. 1–5, 10–13.</ref><ref>Plutarch, "The Life of Coriolanus", 22, 23, 26–28, 31, 39.</ref><ref>Niebuhr, History of Rome, vol. ii, note. 217.</ref>
* Sextus Tullius, a centurion primus pilus in 358 BC, sought permission from the dictator Gaius Sulpicius Peticus to engage the Gauls in battle. He and his colleagues fought with conspicuous bravery. His martial prowess was displayed again in the following year, when he served under the consul Gaius Marcius Rutilus at Priverno.<ref>Livy, vii. 13–16.</ref>
===Tullii Cicerones===
* Marcus Tullius Cicero, grandfather of the orator, was one of the leading men of Arpinum. In 115 BC, the consul Marcus Aemilius Scaurus complimented him on his industry and foresight when he and his brother-in-law, Marcus Gratidius, petitioned on behalf of their city for the right to vote by ballot.<ref>Cicero, De Legibus, ii. 1, iii. 16, De Oratore, ii. 66.</ref>
* Marcus Tullius M. f. Cicero, father of the orator Cicero, was a learned man of literary interests, and moved to Rome in order to provide the best of education for his sons. He kept company with the leading orators and jurists of his day, and died in 64 BC, the year his son was elected consul.<ref>Cicero, De Legibus, ii. 1, De Oratore, ii. 1, De Officiis, iii. 19, Epistulae ad Atticum, i. 6.</ref>
* Lucius Tullius M. f. Cicero, uncle of the orator, was a close friend of Marcus Antonius, the orator, with whom he traveled to Cilicia during the latter's government there. He provided his nephew with regular correspondence for a number of years.<ref>Cicero, De Oratore, ii. 1.</ref>
* Cicero, the orator, was consul in 63 BC, when he suppressed the conspiracy of Catiline, although he was later exiled for having put the conspirators to death without a trial. After his recall, he generally opposed the First Triumvirate, and Caesar in particular, although Caesar deeply admired him, and gladly pardoned him for siding with his enemies. He played no part in Caesar's assassination, but was widely viewed as sympathetic to the murderers, and placed himself in opposition to the Second Triumvirate, by which he was proscribed and put to death. Cicero was the most eminent of the Roman orators, and one of the leading scholars of Roman history and institutions. His vast body of surviving speeches, treatises, and correspondence forms one of the most important sources of Roman history.<ref>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, pp. 708–746.</ref>
* Quintus Tullius Cicero, the younger brother of Cicero, was praetor in 62 BC, and subsequently governor of Asia. He was one of Caesar's generals during the Gallic Wars, but later supported Pompeius during the Civil War. After Caesar's murder, he was proscribed and put to death by the triumvirs.
* Lucius Tullius L. f. M. n. Cicero, the cousin and close friend of the orator, whom he accompanied to Athens in 79 BC, and assisted during the trial of Verres. The people of Syracuse honoured him for his efforts on their behalf. Marcus was deeply aggrieved when Lucius died in 68, while still a young man.<ref>Cicero, De Finibus, v. 1, In Verrem, iv. 11, 61, 64, 65, Epistulae ad Atticum, i. 5.</ref>
* Tullia M. f. M. n., or Tulliola, the beloved daughter of Cicero, married first Gaius Calpurnius Piso Frugi, who died in 57 BC, then briefly to Furius Crassipes, whom she divorced, then in 50 to Publius Cornelius Dolabella, by whom she had two sons; one who died in infancy, and another, Lentulus, who probably died in childhood. Tullia and Dolabella were divorced before the birth of their second son, and she died shortly afterward, to her father's great sorrow.<ref>Orelli, Onomasticon Tullianum, vol. ii., pp. 596, 597.</ref><ref>Drumann, Geschichte Roms, vol. vi, pp. 696 ff.</ref>
* Quintus Tullius Q. f. M. n. Cicero, son of Quintus Cicero, attempted to hide his father from the triumvirs, and was tortured, then put to death along with his father, who gave himself up in the hope of saving his son.
* Cicero Minor, son of the orator, joined the liberatores, Brutus and Cassius after the murder of his father and uncle in the proscription of the triumvirs. He obtained the pardon of Augustus after the Battle of Philippi, and later took his side against Mark Antony. He was consul in 30 BC.

* Marcus Tullius Tiro, a scribe and freedman of Cicero, became a notable author in his own right. He wrote on the Latin, and a life of Cicero, which has been lost; he may have been the chief compiler and preserver of Cicero's correspondence. He was credited with inventing a variety of shorthand, and to have lived to the age of one hundred.<ref>Gellius, xiii. 9.</ref><ref>Cicero, Epistulae ad Familiares, liber xvi, Epistulae ad Atticum, iv. 6, vi. 7, vii. 2, 3, 5, xiii. 7, xvi. 5.</ref><ref>Martial, Epigrammata, xiv. 202.</ref><ref>Manilius, Astronomica, iv. 197.</ref><ref>Seneca the Younger, Epistulae, 90.</ref><ref>Plutarch, "The Life of Cicero", 41, 49.</ref><ref>Drumann, Geschichte Roms, vol. vi, p. 409.</ref>

* Tullius Rufus, a partisan of Pompeius, who was killed at the Battle of Thapsus in 46 BC. He had been quaestor, but the year is uncertain.
* Tiberius Tullius, a partisan of Pompeius during the war in Spain, in 45 BC.<ref>Caesar, De Bello Hispaniensis, 17, 18.</ref>
* Tullius Bassus, or possibly Julius Bassus, a writer on medicine and botany, perhaps belonging to the early first century.<ref>Pliny the Elder, index to Historia Naturalis, xx.</ref><ref>Caelius Aurelianus, De Morbis Acutis, iii. 16, p. 233.</ref><ref>Fabricius, Bibliotheca Graeca, vol. xiii, p. 101 (ed. vet).</ref>
* Lucius Tullius Montanus, a companion of the younger Marcus Tullius Cicero on his journey to Athens in 45 BC.<ref>Cicero, Epistulae ad Atticum, xii. 52, 53, xiv. 16, 17, xv. 26, 29.</ref>
* Lucius Tullius Cimber, a misreading of Tillius Cimber, one of Caesar's assassins.

* Tullius Valentinus, one of the leaders of the Treveri in AD 70, during the Batavian Rebellion. He joined with Julius Tutor in opposing Quintus Petillius Cerialis, and put to death the legates of two legions that had surrendered to Julius Classicus, but was captured by Cerealis at Rigodulum, and was sent to Mucianus and Domitian, by whom he was put to death.<ref>Tacitus, Historiae, iv. 69–74, 85.</ref>
* Publius Tullius Varro, consul suffectus in April of AD 127.<ref>Eck, "Hadrische Konsuln", p. 482.</ref>
* Tullius Geminus, a poet whose epigrams are preserved in the Greek Anthology. The surviving examples describe works of art, and display a number of affectations. A few epigrams attributed solely to Tullius might have been authored by either Tullius Geminus or Marcus Tullius Laurea.<ref>Analecta Veterum, vol. ii, p. 279.</ref><ref>Anthologia Graeca, vol. ii, p. 254, vol. xiii, p. 897.</ref><ref>Fabricius, Bibliotheca Graeca, vol. iv, p. 498.</ref>

The gens Tullia was a family at ancient Rome, with both patrician and plebs branches. The first of this gens to obtain the consulship was Manius Tullius Longus in 500 BC, but the most illustrious of the family was Cicero, the statesman, orator, and scholar of the first century BC. The earliest of the Tullii who appear in history were patrician, but all of the Tullii mentioned in later times were plebeian, and some of them were descended from freedman.<ref name="DGRBM Tullia Gens">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography & Mythology, vol. III, p. 1183 ("Tullia Gens").</ref> The English form Tully, often found in older works, especially in reference to Cicero, is now considered antiquated.
