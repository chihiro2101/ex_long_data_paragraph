Park Lane

===21st century===
The Animals in War Memorial was opened at the northeast edge of Park Lane in 2004 by Anne, Princess Royal. It commemorates animals that served in wars, and alongside servicemen.<ref></ref><ref></ref> In June 2007, a car bomb was successfully defused in an underground car park on Park Lane. The road was closed for most of the day for police investigation.<ref></ref>
The road still attracts notable residents. In 2002, Robert B. Sherman, composer of the musicals Chitty the Musical and Mary Poppins, moved to an apartment on Park Lane following the death of his wife. He enjoyed the views of Hyde Park and in 2003 painted an eponymous portrait, Park Lane.<ref></ref> The business mogul Mohamed Al-Fayed has offices in 55 and 60 Park Lane.<ref></ref> Trevor Rees-Jones, the only survivor of the car crash that killed al-Fayed's son Dodi Fayed and Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, briefly recuperated in a flat on Park Lane following the accident.<ref></ref>
Property prices on Park Lane remain some of the highest in London. In 2006, former Conservative leader of Westminster City Council, Shirley Porter moved into a new £1.5m development on Curzon Square after twelve years of exile in Israel.<ref></ref> In 2015, a report showed the average monthly rent for a 2-bedroom apartment on the road was £5,200.<ref></ref> Homelessness also made use of the road's surroundings from at least 2012, with large begging gangs or other homeless groups sleeping in subways or covered shopping parades despite occasionally being cleared or moved on by police.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
Many of the hotels and establishments on Park Lane are today owned by some of the wealthiest Middle Eastern and Asian businessmen, sheikhs and sultans. The Dorchester was purchased by the Sultan of Brunei in 1985, and since 1996 has been part of the Dorchester Collection, owned by the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA), an arm of the Ministry of Finance of Brunei. The Dorchester Collection connects The Dorchester on Park Lane to other luxury hotels internationally, including The Beverly Hills Hotel and Hotel Bel-Air of Los Angeles, and the Hôtel Meurice of Paris.<ref></ref> In 1978, a new branch of the Allied Arab Bank opened at 131–2 Park Lane,<ref></ref> facilitating the interests of both Arab world and western clients.<ref></ref> Mamasino restaurant at 102 Park Lane serves African cuisine and is African-owned.<ref></ref> Wolfgang Puck's restaurant at No.&nbsp;45 has been described by GQ Magazine as serving one of the best breakfasts in London, with a mixture of American, European and Asian food.<ref></ref>
==Traffic==
Owing to property on the road becoming more desirable, traffic began to increase on Park Lane during the 19th century. A short section of the lane was widened in 1851 as part of the redevelopment work on Marble Arch. In July 1866, following the destruction of the boundary railings after a demonstration supporting the Second Reform Bill, the road was widened as far as Stanhope Gate. In 1871, Hamilton Place was widened to allow an alternative traffic flow to Piccadilly.
By the 1950s, motor traffic levels along Park Lane had reached saturation point. A 1956 survey by the Metropolitan Police reported "at peak hours it is overloaded", with traffic surveys showing 91,000 and 65,000 vehicles travelling around Hyde Park Corner and Marble Arch respectively in a twelve-hour period, making Park Lane the link between the busiest and third busiest road junctions in London.<ref name=plib/> Between 1960 and 1963, the road was widened to three lanes each way either side of a central reservation. This required the demolition of Nos.&nbsp;145–148 Piccadilly, near Hyde Park Corner, which had previously formed a line east of Apsley House.<ref name=bho/><ref name=plib/> The work also re-appropriated East Carriage Drive inside Hyde Park as the northbound carriageway, moving the park's boundary westwards.<ref name=plib/> Additionally, a car park was installed under the road, which became the largest underground parking area in London. Care was taken to preserve as much of the park as possible during the widening works; in all, of park was removed and around 95 trees were felled.<ref></ref><ref></ref> At the time of opening, the project was the largest road improvement scheme in Central London since the construction of Kingsway in 1905.<ref name=plib></ref> The total estimated cost was £1,152,000 (now £.<ref></ref> Further traffic signals were installed at the junction of Park Lane and Hyde Park corner in 1983.<ref></ref>
The road forms part of the London Inner Ring Road and is part of the London congestion charge zone's boundary. When the zone was extended westward in February 2007, Park Lane was designated as one of the "free through routes", on which vehicles could cross the zone during its hours of operation without paying the charge.<ref></ref> The western extension was removed in January 2011.<ref></ref>
In November 2008, the mayor of London, Boris Johnson announced plans to build a tunnel beneath the street, allowing land to be released for development and green spaces.<ref></ref> The traffic improvements and remodelling have diminished the appeal of Park Lane as a residential address, since it became one of the busiest and noisiest roads in central London. In 2011, Johnson introduced spot fines for coaches idling on Park Lane.<ref></ref> The widening of the road distanced the houses on the east side of Park Lane from Hyde Park itself, access to which is now by underpass.<ref></ref> Despite the traffic noise the road is still upmarket, featuring five-star hotels (such as The Dorchester, the Grosvenor House Hotel and the InterContinental London Park Lane Hotel) and showrooms for several sports car models, including BMW,<ref></ref> Aston Martin and Mercedes-Benz.
In 2020, TfL installed a two-way cycle lane on the northbound side of Park Lane.<ref></ref>

Park Lane is the second most valuable property in the London edition of the board game Monopoly. The street had a prestigious social status when the British version of the Monopoly board was first produced, in 1936. On the board, Park Lane forms a pair with Mayfair, the most expensive property in the game. The squares were designed to be equivalents of Park Place and Boardwalk, respectively, on the original board, which used streets in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In 1988, the World Monopoly Championships were held at the Park Lane Hotel, sponsored by Waddingtons, manufacturers of the British version. Since the game's original production, prices on the real Park Lane have held their value, though average rent costs have been overtaken by Bond Street.<ref></ref>
In Arthur Conan Doyle's short story "The Adventure of the Empty House" (1903), Sherlock Holmes investigates and solves a locked-room murder which took place at No. 427 Park Lane (the old numbering), and which is referred to as the "Park Lane Mystery". The story is set in 1894.<ref></ref> The writer Jasper Fforde refers to the street and its Monopoly square in his novel The Eyre Affair (2001), via the character Landen Parke-Laine.<ref></ref>
The street has several mentions in John Galsworthy's 1922 trilogy, The Forsyte Saga. The The Forsyte Saga (1967 series) used Croxteth Hall in Liverpool for footage of James and Emily's house on Park Lane.<ref></ref> The road is mentioned in the second stanza of Noël Coward's patriotic song "London Pride".<ref></ref>
The Mini Countryman is a high-end four wheel drive sport utility vehicle named after the road, where the company has a showroom.<ref></ref> In Walter Lord's book A Night to Remember, which documents the fate of the RMS Titanic, a broad, lower-deck working corridor on E Deck, which ran the length of the ship, was referred to by officers as "Park Lane" (and by crew as "Scotland Road").<ref></ref>

During World War II, several properties on Park Lane were hit by bombs. Dudley House, at No.&nbsp;100, suffered major structural damage, including the destruction of the ballroom and gallery, though the building was partially restored.<ref name=bho/> However, the strength of construction of the Dorchester Hotel gave it the reputation of being one of London's safest buildings, and it was a safe haven for numerous luminaries. General Dwight D. Eisenhower took a suite on the first floor in 1942, and later made it his headquarters.
