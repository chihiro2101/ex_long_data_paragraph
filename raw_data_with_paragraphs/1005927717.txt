Georg Solti

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Solti was born György Stern on Maros utca, in the Hegyvidék district of the Buda side of Budapest.<ref name=pappenheim>Pappenheim, Mark. urltoken "Classical: An honourable homecoming – at last", The Independent, 3 April 1998, accessed 20 March 2016</ref> He was the younger of the two children of Teréz and Móricz "Mor" Stern, both of whom were Jewish.<ref name=dnb>Follows, Stephen. urltoken "Solti, Sir Georg (1912–1997)", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2011, accessed 22 February 2012 </ref> In the aftermath of the First World War it became the accepted practice in Hungary for citizens with Germanic surnames to adopt Hungarian ones. The right wing regime of Miklós Horthy enacted a series of Magyarisation laws, including a requirement that state employees with foreign-sounding names must change them.<ref name=fox /> Mor Stern, a self-employed merchant, felt no need to change his surname, but thought it prudent to change that of his children.<ref name=fox /> He renamed them after Solt, a small town in central Hungary. His son's given name, György, was acceptably Hungarian and was not changed.<ref name=fox>Fox, Sue. urltoken "Georg Solti&nbsp;– A Childhood", The Times, 1 July 1995</ref>
Solti described his father as "a kind, sweet man who trusted everyone. He shouldn't have, but he did. Jews in Hungary were tremendously patriotic. In 1914, when war broke out, my father invested most of his money in a war loan to help the country. By the time the bonds matured, they were worthless."<ref name=fox /> Mor Stern was a religious man, but his son was less so. Late in life Solti recalled, "I often upset him because I never stayed in the synagogue for longer than ten minutes."<ref name=fox /> Teréz Stern was from a musical family, and encouraged her daughter Lilly, by eight years the elder of the children, to sing, and György to accompany her on the piano. Solti remembered, "I made so many mistakes, but it was invaluable experience for an opera conductor. I learnt to swim with her."<ref name=fox /> He was not a diligent student of the piano: "My mother kept telling me to practise, but what ten-year-old wants to play the piano when he could be out playing football?"<ref name=fox />
Solti enrolled at the Ernő Fodor School of Music in Budapest at the age of ten, transferring to the more prestigious Franz Liszt Academy two years later.<ref name=dnb /> When he was 12 he heard a performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony conducted by Erich Kleiber, which gave him the ambition to become a conductor.<ref>Edward Greenfield. urltoken "Sir Georg Solti", Gramophone, October 1982, p. 22</ref> His parents could not afford to pay for years of musical education, and his rich uncles did not consider music a suitable profession; from the age of 13 Solti paid for his education by giving piano lessons.<ref name=fox />
The faculty of the Franz Liszt Academy included some of the most eminent Hungarian musicians, including Béla Bartók, Leó Weiner, Ernő Dohnányi and Zoltán Kodály. Solti studied under the first three, for piano, chamber music and composition respectively. Some sources state that he also studied with Kodály,<ref name=grove>Arthur Jacobs and José A. Bowen. urltoken "Solti, Sir Georg", Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 22 February 2012 </ref><ref name=who> urltoken "Solti, Sir Georg", Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920–2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 22 February 2012 </ref> but in his memoirs Solti recalled that Kodály, whom he would have preferred, turned him down, leaving him to study composition first with Albert Siklós and then with Dohnányi.<ref>Solti, pp. 17 and 22</ref> Not all the Academy's tutors were equally distinguished: Solti remembered with little pleasure the conducting classes run by Ernő Unger, "who instructed his pupils to use rigid little wrist motions. I attended the class for only two years, but I needed five years of practical conducting experience before I managed to unlearn what he had taught me".<ref>Solti. p. 20</ref>
===Pianist and conductor===
After graduating from the Academy in 1930 Solti was appointed to the staff of the Hungarian State Opera. He found that working as a répétiteur, coaching singers in their roles and playing at rehearsals, was a more fruitful preparation than Unger's classes for his intended career as a conductor.<ref name=dnb /> In 1932 he went to Karlsruhe in Germany as assistant to Josef Krips, but within a year, Krips, anticipating the imminent rise to power of Hitler and the Nazis, insisted that Solti should go home to Budapest, where at that time Jews were not in danger.<ref>Solti, p. 31</ref> Other Jewish and anti-Nazi musicians also left Germany for Budapest. Among other musical exiles with whom Solti worked there were Otto Klemperer, Fritz Busch, and Kleiber.<ref name=dnb /> Before Austria fell under Nazi control, Solti was assistant to Arturo Toscanini at the 1937 Salzburg Festival:
After further work as a répétiteur at the opera in Budapest, and with his standing enhanced by his association with Toscanini, Solti was given his first chance to conduct, on 11 March 1938. The opera was The Marriage of Figaro. During that evening, news came of the German invasion of Austria.<ref name=times> urltoken "Sir Georg Solti&nbsp;– Obituary", The Times, 8 September 1997</ref> Many Hungarians feared that Hitler would next invade Hungary; he did not do so, but Horthy, to strengthen his partnership with the Nazis, instituted anti-semitic laws, mirroring the Nuremberg Laws, restricting Hungary's Jews from engaging in professions.<ref>Levy, p. 323</ref> Solti's family urged him to move away.<ref name=dnb /> He went first to London, where he made his Covent Garden debut, conducting the London Philharmonic for a Russian ballet season.<ref>"Opera and Ballet", The Times, 2 July 1938, p. 10</ref> The reviewer in The Times was not impressed with Solti's efforts, finding them "too violent, for he lashed at the orchestra and flogged the music so that he endangered the delicate, evocative atmosphere."<ref name=ballet>"Covent Garden Ballet&nbsp;– Carnaval", The Times, 15 July 1938, p. 14</ref> At about this time Solti dropped the name "György" in favour of "Georg".<ref>Solti, p. 5</ref>
After his appearances in London Solti went to Switzerland to seek out Toscanini, who was conducting in Lucerne. Solti hoped that Toscanini would help find him a post in the US. He was unable to do so, but Solti found work and security in Switzerland as vocal coach to the tenor Max Hirzel, who was learning the role of Tristan in Wagner's opera.<ref name=dnb /> Throughout the Second World War, Solti remained in Switzerland.<ref name=canning /> He did not see his father again: Mor Stern died of diabetes in a Budapest hospital in 1943.<ref>Solti, p. 54</ref> Solti was reunited with his mother and sister after the war.<ref>Solti, p. 55</ref> In Switzerland he could not obtain a work permit as a conductor, but earned his living as a piano teacher.<ref>Solti, p. 59</ref> After he won the 1942 Geneva International Music Competition he was permitted to give piano recitals, but was still not allowed to conduct.<ref>Solti, p. 56</ref> During his exile, he met Hedwig (Hedi) Oeschli, daughter of a lecturer at Zürich University. They married in 1946.<ref name=dnb /> In his memoirs he wrote of her, "She was very elegant and sophisticated. . Hedi gave me a little grace and taught me good manners&nbsp;– although she never completely succeeded in this. She also helped me enormously in my career".<ref> urltoken "Salzburg & Swiss exile", Georg Solti, accessed 23 February 2012</ref>
===Munich and Frankfurt===
With the end of the war Solti's luck changed dramatically. He was appointed musical director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich in 1946.<ref>Robinson, p. 13</ref> In normal circumstances this prestigious post would have been an unthinkable appointment for a young and inexperienced conductor, but the leading German conductors such as Wilhelm Furtwängler, Clemens Krauss and Herbert von Karajan were prohibited from conducting pending the conclusion of denazification proceedings against them.<ref name=dnb /> Under Solti's direction, the company rebuilt its repertoire and began to recover its pre-war eminence.<ref name=grove /> He benefited from the encouragement of the elderly Richard Strauss, in whose presence he conducted Der Rosenkavalier.<ref name=grove /> Strauss was reluctant to discuss his own music with Solti, but gave him advice about conducting.<ref>Solti, pp. 78–79</ref>
In addition to the Munich appointment Solti gained a recording contract in 1946. He signed for Decca Records, not as a conductor but as a piano accompanist.<ref>Culshaw (1967), p 30</ref> He made his first recording in 1947, playing Brahms's First Violin Sonata with the violinist Georg Kulenkampff.<ref name=d /> He was insistent that he wanted to conduct, and Decca gave him his first recording sessions as a conductor later in the same year, with the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra in Beethoven's Egmont overture.<ref name=d /> Twenty years later Solti said, "I'm sure it's a terrible record, because the orchestra was not very good at that time and I was so excited. It is horrible, surely horrible&nbsp;– but by now it has vanished."<ref>Culshaw (1967), p. 31</ref> He had to wait two years for his next recording as a conductor. It was in London, Haydn's Drum Roll symphony, in sessions produced by John Culshaw, with whose career Solti's became closely linked over the next two decades.<ref>Culshaw (1967), p. 32</ref> Reviewing the record, The Gramophone said, "The performance of the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Georg Solti (a fine conductor who is new to me) is remarkable for rhythmic playing, richness of tone, and clarity of execution."<ref> urltoken "Haydn Symphony No. 103 in E flat", The Gramophone, July 1950, p. 16</ref> The Record Guide compared it favourably with EMI's rival recording by Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic.<ref>Sackville-West, p. 355</ref>
In 1951 Solti conducted at the Salzburg Festival for the first time, partly through the influence of Furtwängler, who was impressed by him.<ref name=s85>Solti, pp. 85–86</ref> The work was Idomeneo, which had not been given there before.<ref name=s85 /> In Munich Solti achieved critical and popular success, but for political reasons his position at the State Opera was never secure. The view persisted that a German conductor should be in charge; pressure mounted, and after five years Solti accepted an offer to move to Frankfurt in 1952 as musical director of the Oper Frankfurt.<ref name=dnb /> The city's opera house had been destroyed in the war, and Solti undertook to build a new company and repertoire for its recently completed replacement. He also conducted the symphony concerts given by the opera orchestra.<ref name=s94 /> Frankfurt's was a less prestigious house than Munich's and he initially regarded the move as a demotion,<ref name=s94>Solti, p. 94</ref> but he found the post fulfilling and remained at Frankfurt from 1952 to 1961, presenting 33 operas, 19 of which he had not conducted before.<ref>Solti, p. 127</ref> Frankfurt, unlike Munich, could not attract many of the leading German singers. Solti recruited many rising young American singers such as Claire Watson and Sylvia Stahlman,<ref>Solti, pp. 100 (Watson) and 101 (Stahlman)</ref> to the extent that the house acquired the nickname "Amerikanische Oper am Main". In 1953 the West German government offered Solti German citizenship, which, being effectively stateless as a Hungarian exile, he gratefully accepted. He believed he could never return to Hungary, by then under communist rule.<ref>Solti, p. 96</ref> He remained a German citizen for two decades.<ref>Solti, p. 105</ref>
During his Frankfurt years Solti made appearances with other opera companies and orchestras. He conducted in the Americas for the first time in 1952, giving concerts in Buenos Aires.<ref>Solti, p. 92–93</ref> In the same year he made his debut at the Edinburgh Festival as a guest conductor with the visiting Hamburg State Opera.<ref>Robinson, p. 16</ref> The following year he was a guest at the San Francisco Opera with Elektra, Die Walküre and Tristan und Isolde.<ref>Solti, p. 102</ref> In 1954 he conducted Don Giovanni at the Glyndebourne Festival. The reviewer in The Times said that no fault could be found in Solti's "vivacious and sensitive" conducting.<ref>"Glyndebourne Opera&nbsp;– 'Don Giovanni'", The Times, 8 July 1954, p. 5</ref> In the same year Solti made his first appearance with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, at the Ravinia Festival.<ref> urltoken "Career highlights", Georg Solti, accessed 23 February 2012</ref> In 1960 he made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, conducting Tannhäuser, and he continued to appear there until 1964.<ref> urltoken Search: "Solti", Metropolitan Opera Archives, accessed 10 June 2012</ref>
In the recording studios Solti's career took off after 1956, when John Culshaw was put in charge of Decca's classical recording programme. Culshaw believed Solti to be "the great Wagner conductor of our time",<ref>Culshaw (1967), p. 52</ref> and was determined to record the four operas of Der Ring des Nibelungen with Solti and the finest Wagner singers available.<ref>Culshaw (1967), pp. 52–53</ref> The cast Culshaw assembled for the cycle included Kirsten Flagstad, Hans Hotter, Birgit Nilsson and Wolfgang Windgassen.<ref>Culshaw (1967), pp. 273–274</ref> Apart from Arabella in 1957, in which he substituted when Karl Böhm withdrew, Solti had made no complete recording of an opera until the sessions for Das Rheingold, the first of the Ring tetralogy, in September and October 1958.<ref name=d /> In their respective memoirs Culshaw and Solti told how Walter Legge of Decca's rival EMI predicted that Das Rheingold would be a commercial disaster ("'Very nice,' he said, 'Very interesting. But of course you won't sell any.'")<ref>Culshaw (1967), p. 91</ref> The success of the recording took the record industry by surprise. It featured for weeks in the Billboard charts, the sole classical album alongside best sellers by Elvis Presley and Pat Boone, and brought Solti's name to international prominence.<ref>Culshaw (1967), p. 124</ref> He appeared with leading orchestras in New York, Vienna and Los Angeles, and at Covent Garden he conducted Der Rosenkavalier and Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream.<ref name=dnb />
===Covent Garden===
In 1960 Solti signed a three-year contract to be music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1962.<ref name=s124 /> Even before he took the post the Philharmonic's autocratic president, Dorothy Chandler, breached his contract by appointing a deputy music director without Solti's approval. Although he admired the chosen deputy, Zubin Mehta, Solti felt he could not have his authority undermined from the outset, and he withdrew from his appointment.<ref name=s124 /> He accepted an offer to become musical director of The Royal Opera, London. When first sounded out about the post, he had declined it. After 14 years of experience at Munich and Frankfurt he was uncertain that he wanted a third successive operatic post.<ref name=h257>Haltrecht, p. 257</ref> Moreover, founded only 15 years earlier, the Covent Garden company was not yet the equal of the best opera houses in Europe.<ref>Haltrecht, p. 237</ref> Bruno Walter convinced Solti that it was his duty to take Covent Garden on.<ref>Haltrecht, p. 259</ref>
The biographer Montague Haltrecht suggests that Solti seized the breach of his Los Angeles contract as a convenient pretext to abandon the Philharmonic in favour of Covent Garden.<ref>Haltrecht, p. 258</ref> However, in his memoirs Solti wrote that he wanted the Los Angeles position very much indeed.<ref name=s124>Solti, pp. 124–125</ref> He originally considered holding both posts in tandem, but later acknowledged that he had had a lucky escape, as he could have done justice to neither post had he attempted to hold both simultaneously.<ref name=s124 />
Solti took up the musical directorship of Covent Garden in August 1961.<ref>Haltrecht, p. 264</ref> The press gave him a cautious welcome, but there was some concern that under him there might be a drift away from the company's original policy of opera in English. Solti, however, was an advocate of opera in the vernacular,<ref name=what>"What Sort of Opera for Covent Garden?", The Times, 9 December 1960, p. 18</ref> and he promoted the development of British and Commonwealth singers in the company, frequently casting them in his recordings and important productions in preference to overseas artists.<ref>Haltrecht, p. 295</ref> He demonstrated his belief in vernacular opera with a triple bill in English of L'heure espagnole, Erwartung and Gianni Schicchi.<ref>"Solti's Success with Opera in English", The Times, 18 June 1962, p. 5</ref> As the decade went on, however, more and more productions had to be sung in the original language to accommodate international stars.<ref name=w21>"Sir David Webster's 21 Years at Covent Garden", The Times, 12 April 1965, p. 14</ref>
Like his predecessor Rafael Kubelík, and his successor Colin Davis, Solti found his early days as musical director marred by vituperative hostility from a small clique in the Covent Garden audience.<ref>Haltrecht, pp. 207 (Kubelik) and 271 (Solti); and Canning, Hugh. "Forget the booing, remember the triumph", The Guardian, 19 July 1986, p. 11 (Davis)</ref> Rotten vegetables were thrown at him,<ref name=dnb /> and his car was vandalised outside the theatre, with the words "Solti must go!" scratched on its paintwork.<ref name=h271>Haltrecht, p. 271</ref> Some press reviews were strongly critical; Solti was so wounded by a review in The Times of his conducting of The Marriage of Figaro that he almost left Covent Garden in despair.<ref name=canning /> The chief executive of the Opera House, Sir David Webster, persuaded him to stay with the company, and matters improved, helped by changes on which Solti insisted.<ref>Haltrecht, p. 279</ref> The chorus and orchestra were strengthened,<ref name=dnb /> and in the interests of musical and dramatic excellence, Solti secured the introduction of the stagione system of scheduling performances, rather than the traditional repertory system. He received honorary fellowships or degrees from the Royal College of Music and DePaul, Furman, Harvard, Leeds, London, Oxford, Surrey and Yale universities.<ref name=who />
In celebration of his 75th birthday in 1987, a bronze bust of Solti by Elisabeth Frink was dedicated in Lincoln Park, Chicago, outside the Lincoln Park Conservatory.<ref>Eckert, Thor Jr. urltoken "Milestone for Maestro Solti – Chicago style", The Christian Science Monitor, 15 October 1987, accessed 21 March 2012</ref> It was first displayed temporarily at the Royal Opera House in London.<ref> urltoken "Grant Park: Sir Georg Solti Bust" , Chicago Park District, accessed 21 March 2012</ref> The sculpture was moved to Grant Park in 2006 in a new Solti Garden, near Orchestra Hall in Symphony Center.<ref>

Record industry awards to Solti included the Grand Prix Mondial du Disque (14 times) and 31 Grammy Awards (including a special Trustees' Grammy Award, shared with John Culshaw, for the recording of the Ring (1967) and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (1996)).<ref name=who /> He won more Grammys than any other recording artist, whether classical or popular.<ref name=deccaweb /> In September 2007, as a tribute on the 10th anniversary of his death, Decca published a recording of his final concert.<ref name=d />

Sir Georg Solti, ; born György Stern; 21 October 1912 – 5 September 1997)<ref></ref> was a Hungarian-born British orchestral and operatic conductor, best known for his appearances with opera companies in Munich, Frankfurt and London, and as a long-serving music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Born in Budapest, he studied there with Béla Bartók, Leó Weiner and Ernő Dohnányi. In the 1930s, he was a répétiteur at the Hungarian State Opera and worked at the Salzburg Festival for Arturo Toscanini. His career was interrupted by the rise of the Nazis' influence on Hungarian politics, and being of Jewish background he fled the increasingly harsh Hungarian anti-Jewish laws in 1938. After conducting a season of Russian ballet in London at the Royal Opera House he found refuge in Switzerland, where he remained during the Second World War. Prohibited from conducting there, he earned a living as a pianist.
After the war, Solti was appointed musical director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich in 1946. In 1952 he moved to the Oper Frankfurt, where he remained in charge for nine years. He took West German citizenship in 1953. In 1961 he became musical director of the The Royal Opera, London. During his ten-year tenure, he introduced changes that raised standards to the highest international levels. Under his musical directorship the status of the company was recognised with the grant of the title "the Royal Opera". He became an honorary citizen of the coastal holiday town of Castiglione della Pescaia, and a British subject in 1972.
In 1969 Solti became music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, a post he held for 22 years. He conducted multiple recordings and high-profile international tours with the orchestra. Solti relinquished the position in 1991 and became the orchestra's music director laureate, a position he held until his death. During his time as the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's eighth music director, he also served as music director of the Orchestre de Paris from 1972 until 1975 and principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra from 1979 until 1983.
Known in his early years for the intensity of his music making, Solti was widely considered to have mellowed as a conductor in later years. He recorded many works two or three times at various stages of his career, and was a prolific recording artist, making more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. The most famous of his recordings is probably Decca's complete set of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, made between 1958 and 1965. Solti's Ring has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, in polls for Gramophone magazine in 1999 and the BBC's Music Magazine in 2012. Solti was repeatedly honoured by the recording industry with awards throughout his career, including a record 31 Grammy Awards as a recording artist.
