Mickey Cochrane

==Playing career==
===Philadelphia Athletics===
Cochrane was born in Bridgewater, Massachusetts. His father, John Cochrane, had immigrated from Omagh, County Tyrone in what is now Northern Ireland and his mother, Sadie Campbell, had come from Prince Edward Island, Canada, whence her family had immigrated from Scotland.<ref name="The Baseball Biography Project: Mickey Cochrane"/> He was also known as "Black Mike" because of his fiery, competitive nature.<ref name="The Baseball Biography Project: Mickey Cochrane"/><ref name="Mickey Cochrane Obituary at Baseball Almanac"/> Cochrane was educated at Boston University, where he played five sports, excelling at football and basketball.<ref name="The Detroit Tigers Encyclopedia Honoring a Detroit Legend"></ref> Although Cochrane considered himself a better football player than a baseball player, professional football was not as established as Major League Baseball at the time, so he signed with the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League in .<ref></ref>
After just one season in the minor leagues, Cochrane was promoted to the major leagues, making his debut with the Philadelphia Athletics on April 14, 1925 at the age of 22.<ref name="Mickey Cochrane at Baseball Reference"/> He made an immediate impact by becoming Connie Mack's starting catcher in place of Cy Perkins, who was considered one of the best catchers in the major leagues at the time.<ref></ref> A left-handed batter, he ran well enough that Mack would occasionally have him bat leadoff. He hit third more often, but whatever his place in the order his primary role was to get on base so that hard-hitting Al Simmons and Jimmie Foxx could drive him in. In May, he tied a twentieth-century major league record by hitting three home runs in a game.<ref></ref> He ended his rookie season with a .331 batting average and a .397 on-base percentage, helping the Athletics to a second-place finish.
By the start of the 1926 season, Cochrane was already considered the best catcher in the major leagues.<ref></ref> He won the American League Most Valuable Player Award, mostly for his leadership and defensive skills, when he led the American League in putouts and hit .293 along with 10 home runs and 58 runs batted in.<ref name="The Baseball Biography Project: Mickey Cochrane"/><ref></ref> Cochrane was a catalyst in the Athletics' pennant-winning years of 1929, 1930 and 1931, during which he hit .331, .357 and .349 respectively.<ref name="Mickey Cochrane at Baseball Reference"/><ref name="The Detroit Tigers Encyclopedia Honoring a Detroit Legend"/> He played in those three World Series, winning the first two, but was sometimes blamed for the loss of the 1931 World Series, when the St. Louis Cardinals, led by Pepper Martin, stole eight bases and the Series. However, in his book The Life of a Baseball Hall of Fame Catcher, author Charlie Bevis cites the Philadelphia pitching staff's carelessness in holding runners as a contributing factor.<ref name="The Life of a Baseball Hall of Fame Catcher"></ref><ref></ref> Notwithstanding this, the blame for the 1931 World Series loss dogged Cochrane for the rest of his life.<ref name="The Life of a Baseball Hall of Fame Catcher"/>
===Detroit Tigers===
In 1934, Mack started to disassemble his dynasty for financial reasons and put Cochrane on the trade block. He found a willing recipient in the Detroit Tigers. Their owner, Frank Navin, was also suffering from financial troubles. They had not finished higher than third since 1923, and had developed a reputation for being content with mediocrity. Attendance at Navin Field had sagged for some time. Navin had originally hoped to acquire Babe Ruth and name him player-manager, but after those talks fizzled, he turned to the A's.<ref>Ferkovich, Scott. urltoken A Look Back at When Babe Ruth Nearly Became the Detroit Tigers’ Player-Manager. Seamheads.com, 2014-07-14.</ref> A deal to send Cochrane to Detroit was quickly arranged, and Navin immediately named him player-manager.<ref name="The Detroit Tigers Encyclopedia Honoring a Detroit Legend"/>
It was with Detroit where Cochrane cemented his reputation as a team leader and his competitive nature drove the Tigers, who had been picked to finish in fourth or fifth place, to the American League championship, their first pennant in 25 years.<ref name="The Detroit Tigers Encyclopedia Honoring a Detroit Legend"/><ref></ref><ref name="They Earned Their Stripes: The Detroit Tigers' All-Time Team"></ref> Cochrane routinely platooned Gee Walker, a right-handed batter, to spell left fielder Goose Goslin and center fielder Jo-Jo White, who were both left-handed batters.<ref></ref> Cochrane's leadership and strategic skills won him the 1934 Most Valuable Player Award, remarkable considering that Lou Gehrig had won the Triple Crown.<ref name="The Detroit Tigers Encyclopedia Honoring a Detroit Legend" /><ref></ref> He followed this by leading the Tigers to another American League pennant in and earning a victory over the Chicago Cubs in the 1935 World Series.<ref></ref> In late 1935, the Detroit Free Press speculated Cochrane might eventually succeed Navin as team president.<ref name=Presidency></ref> Due in part to his high-strung nature, however, he suffered a nervous breakdown during the 1936 season.<ref name="The Detroit Tigers Encyclopedia Honoring a Detroit Legend"/>
On May 25, 1937; Cochrane was hit in the head by a pitch from Yankees pitcher Bump Hadley. Cochrane had homered in his previous at-bat that day. Hospitalized for seven days, Cochrane nearly died from the injury. This accident generated a call for protective helmets for batters, although tradition won out at that time.<ref></ref> Cochrane was forced to retire at the age of 34 after doctors ordered him not to attempt to play baseball again.<ref name="They Earned Their Stripes: The Detroit Tigers' All-Time Team"/>
Cochrane compiled a .320 batting average while hitting 119 home runs and 830 runs batted in over a 13-year playing career. He also had 1,652 hits, 1,041 runs scored, 333 doubles, 64 triples, 64 stolen bases and a .478 slugging percentage.<ref name="Mickey Cochrane at Baseball Reference"/> His .320 batting average was the highest career mark for catchers until Joe Mauer surpassed it in .<ref></ref> His .419 on-base percentage is among the best in baseball history, and is the highest all-time among catchers.<ref name="The Baseball Biography Project: Mickey Cochrane"/><ref></ref> In , he became the first major league catcher to score 100 runs and produce 100 runs batted in during the same season.<ref></ref>
He hit for the cycle twice in his career, on July 22, 1932 and August 2, 1933.<ref></ref><ref name="Mickey Cochrane at www.thehitters.com"></ref>
In his first 11 years, he never caught fewer than 110 games.<ref name="The Baseball Biography Project: Mickey Cochrane"/> He led American League catchers six times in putouts and twice each in double plays assists and fielding percentage.<ref name="Mickey Cochrane at www.thehitters.com"/><ref></ref>
Cochrane returned to the dugout to continue managing the Tigers but had lost his competitive fire.<ref name="They Earned Their Stripes: The Detroit Tigers' All-Time Team"/> He managed for the remainder of the 1937 season but was replaced midway through the 1938 season by coach and former catcher Del Baker.<ref name="The Detroit Tigers Encyclopedia Honoring a Detroit Legend"/> His all-time managerial record was 348-250, for a .582 winning percentage.<ref></ref>
==Later life and legacy==
Despite his head injury, Cochrane served in the United States Navy during World War II.<ref name="Mickey Cochrane Obituary at Baseball Almanac"/><ref name="The Detroit Tigers Encyclopedia Honoring a Detroit Legend"/> Commissioned as a lieutenant and assigned to Naval Station Great Lakes, he oversaw physical training of new recruits and coached the base baseball team.<ref name="Bedingfield"></ref> On July 7, 1942, Cochrane managed an All-Service team that played against an American League all-star squad at Cleveland’s Municipal Stadium; the American League team beat the servicemen, 5-0.<ref name="Bedingfield"/> Later in the war Cochrane, by now a lieutenant commander, was assigned to a similar role in the Pacific War.<ref></ref>

Gordon Stanley "Mickey" Cochrane (April 6, 1903 – June 28, 1962), nicknamed "Black Mike", was an American professional baseball player, manager and coach.<ref name="Mickey Cochrane at Baseball Reference"></ref> He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the Philadelphia Athletics and Detroit Tigers. Cochrane was considered one of the best catchers in baseball history and is a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame.<ref name="The Baseball Biography Project: Mickey Cochrane"></ref><ref name="Mickey Cochrane Obituary at Baseball Almanac"></ref><ref name="Mickey Cochrane at The Baseball Hall of Fame"></ref>
Cochrane was born in Massachusetts and was a multi-sport athlete at Boston University. After college, he chose baseball over basketball and football. He made his major league debut in 1925, having spent only one season in the minor leagues. He was chosen as the American League (AL) Most Valuable Player in 1928 and he appeared in the World Series from 1929 to 1931. Philadelphia won the first two of those World Series, but Cochrane was criticized for giving up stolen bases when his team lost the series in 1931. Cochrane's career batting average (.320) stood as a record for MLB catchers until 2009.
Cochrane's career ended abruptly after a near-fatal head injury from a pitched ball in 1937. After his professional baseball career, he served in the United States Navy in World War II and ran an automobile business. Cochrane died of cancer in 1962. In 1999, The Sporting News ranked him 65th on its list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players.
