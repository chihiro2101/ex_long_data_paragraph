Wyvern

== Etymology ==
The current spelling wyvern is not attested before the seventeenth century as "winged two-footed dragon".<ref name=Hoad></ref> According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it is an alteration of Middle English wyver (attested thirteenth century), from Anglo-French wivre (cf. French guivre and vouivre), which originate from Latin vīpera, meaning "viper", "adder", or "asp".<ref name=Hoad /><ref></ref> Conversely, medievalism William Sayers proposes a more complex origin for the term. He notes that the Anglo-French guivre and its Middle English derivative ceased to retain the original sense of "venomous snake" after the Latin term was re-introduced into medieval Latin, freeing them up to take an alternate meaning.<ref name=sayers>Sayers, William. "The Wyvern". Neuphilologische Mitteilungen 109.4 (2008): 457-465.</ref> Adducing another meaning of wiver (this time Old English) and guivre, "light javelin",<ref name=sayers /> and noting partial resemblances between the size and shape of javelins and snakes,<ref name=sayers /> plus the later medieval era's increasing use of heavy armor and decreasing use of light javelins, he proposes that the concepts of "venomous snake" and "light javelin" were melded to produce a new term for a previously unimagined concept of flying snake, a kind of dragon.<ref name=sayers />
== History ==
The design of the wyvern is thought to have derived from the figure of the dragon encountered by Trajan's legions in Dacia. It may be the origin of the red dragon of Wales and the golden dragon of the Kingdom of Wessex carried at the Battle of Burford in AD 752.<ref></ref>
The depiction of dragons representing Wales goes back centuries; as seen in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, when depicting Merlin's prophecy of the red dragon of Wales beating the white Anglo-Saxon dragon, they are seen to have two legs rather than the modern four legs that the current Welsh dragon possesses.<ref></ref>
Since the 4th century, Welsh Kings and princes have carried with them this depiction of a dragon, each ruler changing its appearance from a Wyvern to a four-legged dragon.
The concept of Amphiptere is common in cultures around the Mediterranean, with a notable example being the Egyptian goddess Wadjet.<ref>Valery Rees, From Gabriel to Lucifer: A Cultural History of Angels, I.B.Tauris, 19/03/2013</ref> The oldest creatures outright referred to as "winged dragons" are Helios's chariot steeds, which aid Medea.
== Distinction from dragons ==
Wyverns are very similar to dragons, and in many languages, cultures and contexts no clear distinction is made between the two. Since the sixteenth century, in English, Scottish, and Irish heraldry, the key difference has been that a wyvern has two legs, whereas a dragon has four. However, this distinction is not commonly observed in the heraldry of other European countries, where two-legged dragon-like creatures being called dragons is entirely acceptable.<ref></ref>
== In modern fiction ==
In the modern fantasy genre, there is little differentiation between dragons and wyverns, with two-legged magical reptilian creatures all likely to be referred to as "dragons" without any differentiation between types. Wyverns, when present as creatures distinct from dragons, tend to appear as less magical and more as dangerous beasts: smaller, weaker, and less intelligent than dragons. While a fantasy dragon often has a breath weapon, such as fire, wyverns rarely have such abilities and are more feared for their ferocity and sharp teeth and claws. Wyverns are sometimes associated with poison, either in the form of venomous fangs or tail barb, or poisonous breath, but this trait is not universally represented and may be a more recent addition to the lore based on the gila monster.<ref></ref>
The wyvern frequently features in modern fantasy fiction, though its first literary appearances may have been in medieval bestiary.<ref>A wyvern and an elephant may be found at Harley MS 3244 (dated 13th century, after c. 1236), urltoken f.39v.</ref>
== In heraldry ==
The wyvern is a frequent charge in English heraldry and vexillology, also occasionally appearing as a supporter or crest.
A wyvern is typically depicted resting upon its legs and tail, but may be depicted with its claws in the air and only supported by its tail. On occasion, a wyvern may be depicted as wingless and with its tail nowed.<ref name=Davies></ref>
A white (Argent) wyvern formed the crest of the Leicester as recorded at the heraldic visitation of Leicestershire in 1619: "A wyvern sans legs argent strewed with wounds gules, wings expanded ermine." The term "sans legs" may not imply that the wyvern was "without legs", rather than its legs are not depicted, being hidden or folded under.<ref>Geoffrey Briggs, Civic & Corporate Heraldry, London 1971<br>C. W. Scot-Giles, Civic Heraldry of England and Wales, 2nd edition, London, 1953<br>A. C. Fox-Davies, The Book of Public Arms, London 1915</ref> This was adopted by the Midland Railway in 1845 when it became the crest of its unofficial coat of arms.<ref>Cuthbert Hamilton Ellis, The Midland Railway, 1953</ref> The company asserted that the "wyvern was the standard of the Mercia", and that it was "a quartering in the town arms of Leicester".<ref>Frederick Smeeton Williams, The Midland Railway: Its rise and progress: A narrative of modern enterprise, 1876<br>The Railway Magazine, Vol. 102, 1897<br><br>Clement Edwin Stretton, History of The Midland Railway, 1901</ref> However, in 1897 the Railway Magazine noted that there appeared "to be no foundation that the wyvern was associated with the Kingdom of Mercia".<ref name="railmag">The Railway Magazine, Vol. 102, 1897</ref> It has been associated with Leicester since the time of Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster (c. 1278–1322), the most powerful lord in the Midlands, who used it as his personal crest.<ref></ref>
A green Wyvern stands in the emblem of the ancient and historical Umbrian city of Terni, the dragon is called by the citizens with the name of Thyrus. A sable wyvern on a white background with endorsed wings forms the coat of arms of the Tilley family.

A wyvern , sometimes spelled wivern) is a legendary bipedal winged dragon usually depicted with a tail ending in a diamond- or arrow-shaped tip. <ref></ref>
The wyvern in its various forms is important to heraldry, frequently appearing as a mascot of schools and athletic teams (chiefly in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada). It is a popular creature in European literature, video games, and modern fantasy. The wyvern in heraldry and folklore is rarely fire-breathing, unlike the four-legged dragon.
