Andrzej Lepper

==Early life==
Lepper was born in Stowięcino, a tiny hamlet of roughly 200 people.<ref name="AIA"></ref> Formerly a thriving community, it became a place of socio-cultural impoverishment and economic struggle since Poland's transformation into a market-based economy. During this transition period his farm, just like majority of small businesses in Poland, found itself on a verge of bankruptcy, but survived. 
A farmer by trade, Lepper completed all course-work required at the State Agricultural Technical School in Sypniewo, yet did not undertake the final qualifying exam. He also had no formal higher education,<ref name="AIA"/> but was presented with several "doctor honoris causa" awards, including by the University of Kyiv (Ukraine) in recognition of his work, commitment and outreach.<ref name="AIA"/>
Lepper was married and together with his wife Irena have three children.
==Political career==
For 2 years (1978-80) he was a member of PZPR Polish United Workers' Party, Poland's equivalent of a formal communist party during the PRL (Polish Ppl Republic 1947/48-1989). In 1992 Lepper formed his own political party, an organisation of economically struggling farmers like himself, naming it "Samoobrona" (Self-defence) (SO).<ref name="AIA"/> Lepper organised anti-government demonstrations and other actions, most significantly against the politics of Suchocka and Buzek governments, both characterised by growing social and socio-economic injustice, especially experienced by the Polish countryside.<ref name="JB/JLT"></ref>
As a party leader, he challenged Aleksander Kwaśniewski in the 1995 presidential election (1.3% votes). In the 2000, SO organised campaigns of roadblock (barrier)<ref name="AIA"/> to bring the public opinion and mass media attention to the growing impoverishment of the Polish agriculture. Lepper won 3.05% votes in the 2000 presidential election. In the 2001 parliamentary election, Lepper's party enter the lower chamber of the Polish Parliament (Sejm).<ref name="AIA"/> Lepper was elected from Koszalin constituency.<ref name="JB/JLT"/>
Lepper's party received 11.4% of the vote and 56 seats in the 2005 Polish parliamentary election, making it the 3rd biggest party in the Sejm. Andrzej Lepper stood in the 2005 Polish presidential election as the party's candidate and received 15% of the vote, the third highest result.<ref name="JB/JLT"/>
Lepper led the SO party to form a majority coalition with the PiS party in May 2006, assuming the office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture. This tenure was abruptly terminated in September 2006, and Lepper was invited to re-join the Jarosław Kaczyński Cabinet on the 16 October 2006.<ref name="JB/JLT"/>
==Political style and views==
Samoobrona ("SO") and Lepper successfully tapped into the disillusion felt by millions of poor citizens who have not benefited from Poland's entry into the European Union. Many SO voters live in small towns and villages with high unemployment rates, and therefore believe that they have lost out in the transition to the free market economy after 1989. However, Lepper was often criticized for not acknowledging the economic growth Poland has experienced since then.<ref name="JB/JLT"/>
Using strongly Populism messages and committing acts of civil disobedience, he managed to gain nationwide publicity and a strong following in the countryside, where he was regarded as a common man. He also protested against the selling of Polish land to foreigners. Lepper and SO opposed Poland joining the European Union, but stopped short of running a fully fledged "no" campaign, on account of the popular predisposition of the Polish population towards EU membership.<ref name=Guardian></ref>
Lepper's anti-EU stance was based in part on nationalism, but also on the presumed detrimental economic effect that accession would have on Poland agriculture. Lepper remained a Eurosceptic, but later toned down his position since. During his tenure as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture, Lepper worked hard for Polish agriculture within the European structures and on his departure was described by Union officials as "pragmatic" and "professional".<ref name=Guardian/>
Andrzej Lepper was one of the few high-profile politicians that consistently opposed Poland's involvement in American global military operations. He was involved in promoting close relations with the country's eastern neighbours – Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.
Some of his many famous quotes are that "It is impossible to rape a prostitute",<ref> urltoken Sexual harassment allegations plague Poland's deputy PM. The Raw Story; retrieved 7 September 2013.</ref> or "I see myself as a positive dictator".<ref> urltoken Seite 2 von 2|polen: Ich, der Diktator|ZEIT ONLINE, Zeit.de (17 June 2004); retrieved 7 September 2013.</ref> Lepper himself appeared to be a restless man, not easily placated and not inclined to settle down as an office holder, as his participation in Kaczyński's government showed.
With the votes of the left-wing majority in the Sejm, in 2001 he was elected as Vice-Speaker of Sejm (Marszałek Sejmu), but after violating time constraints in debates he was dismissed. Among Lepper and SO's undertakings in parliament were such incidents as the use of their own loudspeakers in the Sejm and claims that Robert Smoktunowicz of the liberal Civic Platform engaged in the precious-stone trade doing business with the Afghan Taliban.
==Criminal charges==
Andrzej Lepper was charged with criminal offenses, including assault, blocking roads and dumping grain on railroad tracks in the course of anti-government demonstrations (The New York Times, 2006).<ref>Gelb, Leslie H. (30 August 2013) urltoken The New York Times - Breaking News, World News & Multimedia, International Herald Tribune; retrieved 7 September 2013.</ref>
In May 2001 Lepper was sentenced to sixteen months in prison. In May 2006 Polish students protested against the coalition government and also mocked Lepper's recent criminal conviction for slander, chanting "Lepper to prison".<ref> urltoken Polish Students March in Warsaw, Protest Coalition Government , bloomberg.com; accessed 13 June 2016.</ref>
As of 2007 Lepper faced criminal charges for slander and levelling corruption accusations against ministers and members of the parliament (Financial Times, 2002).<ref> urltoken The Institute for Ethics and Economic Policy (IEEP) at Fordham University, Fordham.edu; retrieved 7 September 2013.</ref>
==Sex crimes==
In December 2006 a female party member claimed that Lepper and party deputy Stanisław Łyżwiński had demanded sexual favours in exchange for a job in a regional SO party office. After the publication of these claims in the Gazeta Wyborcza,<ref></ref> several other women came forward with similar accusations. Poland's chief prosecutor Janusz Kaczmarek later launched an investigation into the abuse allegations against both men. In February 2010 Andrzej Lepper was sentenced to two years and three months in jail after being found guilty of demanding and accepting sexual favours from female members of his SO party. The district court in central Poland also sentenced former SO party deputy Stanislaw Lyzwinski to five years for rape and taking sexual advantage of female members of his party. Lepper said that the entire case against him was "imagined", and that he would appeal the decision.<ref></ref><ref> urltoken Ex-deputy PM jailed for sex crimes, AFP (The Australian reprint), 12 Feb 2010</ref>

==2007 political developments==
On 9 July 2007, Prime Minister Kaczyński dismissed Lepper from the government, which Kaczyński said was due to suspicions that Lepper was involved in corruption. On 10 July, Lepper said that Samoobrona would withdraw from the ruling coalition, but later on the same day said that the party would remain in the coalition conditionally.<ref>Judy Dempsey, urltoken "Polish leader considers early elections", International Herald Tribune, 10 July 2007.</ref> Lepper claimed to have been the victim of a politically motivated 'sting' operation, initiated by Prime Minister Kaczynski and PiS, and he demanded that a parliamentary inquiry be conducted to investigate the legality and motivation of the Central Anticorruption Bureau operation mounted against him. This was one of the conditions put to PiS in return for SO remaining within the coalition.
On 16 July 2007, Lepper, together with Roman Giertych, chairman of another junior coalition partner League of Polish Families, announced a merger of their two parties, to be called League and Self-Defense (LiS). On August 5, the party quit the ruling coalition, leaving it without a majority.<ref>Dorota Bartyzel and Marta Waldoch, urltoken "Polish Self Defense Party Quits Coalition; Early Elections Loom" , Bloomberg.com, 5 August 2007.</ref>
Early parliamentary elections for both houses of parliament (Sejm and Senat) were held on 21 October 2007, after the Sejm voted for its own dissolution on 7 September.
The party suffered a huge voter backlash, thereby failing to cross the 5% electoral threshold for elections to the Sejm. Consequently, it lost all its seats. He was a candidate in the 2010 Polish presidential election, but received just 1.28% of votes and so did not proceed into the second round.
==Suicide==
Lepper was found dead in his Warsaw office on 5 August 2011. Police said that he likely committed suicide.<ref> urltoken BBC News – Poland's Andrzej Lepper dead</ref> The public prosecutor's office conducted investigation to determine possible motives for his suicide as well. Lepper hanged himself from a ceiling hook for a boxing punch bag. After his autopsy, foul play was ruled out. The investigation ended in late 2012. It was determined that Lepper suffered from a crushing depression due to his enormous debts on all fronts including at his farm, his spectacular political defeat and the sex scandals.<ref name="Kącki"></ref>
