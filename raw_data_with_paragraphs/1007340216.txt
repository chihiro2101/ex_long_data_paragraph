Oda of Canterbury

==Early career==
Oda's parents were Danish, and he may have been born in East Anglia.<ref name=Brooks222>Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury p. 222–224</ref> His father was said to have been a Dane who came to England in 865, together with the Viking army of Ubba and Ivar, and presumably settled in East Anglia. Oda's nephew Oswald of Worcester later became Archbishop of York. It is possible that Oswald's relatives Oscytel, afterwards Archbishop of York, and Thurcytel, an abbot, were also relatives of Oda, but this is not known for sure.<ref name=DNB/>
In Byrhtferth's Life of Saint Oswald, Oda is said to have joined the household of a pious nobleman called Æthelhelm, whom he accompanied to Rome on pilgrimage. While on pilgrimage, Oda healed the nobleman's illness.<ref name=ASE>Lapidge "Oda" Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England</ref> Other stories, such as those by the 12th-century writer William of Malmesbury, describe Oda as fighting under Edward the Elder and then becoming a priest, but these statements are unlikely. Other statements in the Life have Oda being named "Bishop of Wilton" by the king, who is stated to have been Æthelhelm's brother.<ref name=DNB>Cubitt and Costambeys "Oda" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</ref> The chronicler may be referring, slightly inaccurately, to Aethelhelm cousin of the king. This benefactor has also been associated with bishop Athelm, who reportedly sponsored Oda in his ecclesiastical career.<ref>Fletcher Conversion of Europe p. 393</ref> Some sources state that Oda became a monk at Fleury-sur-Loire in France.<ref name=DNB/><ref name=ASE448>Stenton Anglo-Saxon England p. 448</ref>
==Bishop of Ramsbury==
Oda was consecrated Bishop of Ramsbury sometime between 909 and 927,<ref name=Handbook220>Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 220</ref> not to Wilton as stated by both William of Malmesbury and the Life. The appointment was most likely made by King Æthelstan, and the first securely attested mention in documents of the new bishop occurs in 928, when he is a witness to royal charters as bishop.<ref name=DNB/> According to the late tenth-century chronicler, Richerus, in 936 Æthelstan sent Oda to France to arrange the return to the throne of France of King Louis IV.<ref name=ASE347/><ref name=Foot169>Foot Æthelstan p. 169</ref> Louis was Æthelstan's nephew<ref name=BASE159/> and had been in exile in England for a number of years.<ref name=ASE347>Stenton Anglo-Saxon England p. 347</ref> However, this story is not related in any contemporary records.<ref name=DNB/> Oda was said to have accompanied King Æthelstan at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937.<ref name=ASE/><ref name=DictSaint>Delaney Dictionary of Saints p. 464</ref> It was at this battle that Oda is said to have miraculously provided a sword to the king when the king's own sword slipped out of its scabbard. A Ramsey chronicle records that in the 1170s, the sword was still preserved in the royal treasury, although the chronicler carefully states the story "as is said" rather than as fact.<ref name=Clanchy40>Clanchy From Memory to Written Record p. 40</ref> There are no contemporary records of Oda's appearance at the battle.<ref name=DNB/> In 940, Oda arranged a truce between Olaf III Guthfrithson, king of Dublin and York, and Edmund I, king of England.<ref name=DNB/>
==Archbishop of Canterbury==
In 941 Oda was named Archbishop of Canterbury.<ref name=Handbook214>Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 214</ref> During his time as archbishop, he helped King Edmund with the new royal law-code,<ref name=DNB/> which had a number of laws concerned with ecclesiastical affairs.<ref name=ASE/> The archbishop was present, along with Archbishop Wulfstan of York, at council that proclaimed the first of these law codes and which was held by Edmund<ref name=Wormald310>Wormald Making of English Law p. 310</ref> at London, over Easter around 945 or 946.<ref name=Wormald440>Wormald Making of English Law pp. 440–441</ref> Oda also settled a dispute over the Five Burghs with Wulfstan.<ref name=ASE/>
Oda also made constitutions, or rules, for his clergy. His Constitutions of Oda are the first surviving constitutions of a 10th-century English ecclesiastical reformer.<ref name=Stafford9>Stafford Unification and Conquest p. 9–10</ref> Oda reworked some statutes from 786 to form his updated code, and one item that was dropped were any clauses dealing with paganism.<ref name=Blair>Blair Church in Anglo-Saxon Society p. 481 footnote 252</ref> Other items covered were relations between laymen and the clergy, the duties of bishops, the need for the laity to make canonical marriages, how to observe fasts, and the need for tithes to be given by the laity.<ref name=Darlington386/> The work is extant in just one surviving manuscript, British Museum Cotton Vespasian A XIV, folios 175v to 177v. This is an 11th-century copy done for Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York.<ref name=Schoebe>Schoebe "Chapters of Archbishop Oda" Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research pp. 75–83</ref>
At the death of King Eadred of England in 955, Oda was one of the recipients of a bequest from the king, in his case a large amount of gold.<ref name=Fletcher24>Fletcher Bloodfeud p. 24</ref> He was probably behind the reestablishment of a bishopric at Elmham, as the line of bishops in that see starts with Eadwulf of Elmham in 956.<ref name=ASE437>Stenton Anglo-Saxon England p. 437</ref> Oda crowned King Eadwig in 956, but in late 957 the archbishop joined Eadwig's rival and brother Edgar who had been proclaimed king of the Mercians in 957, while Eadwig continued to rule Wessex.<ref name=Stafford48/> The exact cause of the rupture between the two brothers that led to the division of the previously united kingdom is unknown, but may have resulted from Eadwig's efforts to promote close kinsmen and his wife. The division was peaceful, and Eadwig continued to call himself "King of the English" in contrast to Edgar's title of "King of the Mercians".<ref name=BASE151>Miller "Eadwig" Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England pp. 151–152</ref> In early 958 Oda annulled the marriage of Eadwig and his wife Ælfgifu, who were too closely related.<ref name=Stafford48>Stafford Unification and Conquest p. 48–49</ref> This act was likely a political move connected to the division between Eadwig and Edgar, as it is unlikely that the close kinship between Eadwig and Ælfgifu had not been known before their marriage.<ref name=BASE151/>
Oda was a supporter of Dunstan's monastic reforms,<ref name=Darlington387>Darlington "Ecclesiastical Reform" English Historical Review p. 387</ref> and was a reforming agent in the church along with Cenwald the Bishop of Worcester and Ælfheah the Bishop of Winchester. He also built extensively, and re-roofed Canterbury Cathedral after raising the walls higher.<ref name=DNB/> In 948, Oda took Saint Wilfrid's relics from Ripon.<ref name=Blair314>Blair Church in Anglo-Saxon Society p. 314</ref> Frithegod's verse Life of Wilfrid has a preface that was written by Oda, in which the archbishop claimed that he rescued the relics from Ripon, which he described as "decayed" and "thorn-covered".<ref name=Brooks53>Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury p. 53</ref> He also acquired the relics of St Ouen, and Frithegod also wrote, at Oda's behest, a verse life of that saint, which has been lost.<ref name=ASE/> He was also an active in reorganizing the diocesan structure of his province, as the sees of Elmham and Lindsey were reformed during his archbishopric.<ref name=Darlington386>Darlington "Ecclesiastical Reform" English Historical Review p. 386</ref>
The archbishop died on 2 June 958<ref name=Handbook214/> and is regarded as a saint, with a feast day of 4 July.<ref name=Saints>Walsh New Dictionary of Saints p. 454–455</ref> Other dates were also commemorated, including 2 June or 29 May. After his death, legendary tales ascribed miracles to him, including one where the Eucharist dripped with blood. Another was the miraculous repair of a sword.<ref name=ODS393>Farmer Oxford Dictionary of Saints p. 393</ref> There is no contemporary evidence for veneration being made to Oda, with the first indication of cult coming in the hagiography written by Byrhtferth about Oswald, but no hagiography specifically about Oda was written until Eadmer wrote the Vita sancti Odonis sometime between 1093 and 1125.<ref name=DNB/> Oda was known by contemporaries as "The Good"<ref name=ASE/> and also became known as Severus "The Severe".

Oda (or Odo;<ref name=ODS393/> died 958), called the Good or the Severe, was a 10th-century Archbishop of Canterbury in England. The son of a Danish invader, Oda became Bishop of Ramsbury before 928. A number of stories were told about his actions both prior to becoming and while a bishop, but few of these incidents are recorded in contemporary accounts. After being named to Canterbury in 941, Oda was instrumental in crafting royal legislation as well as involved in providing rules for his clergy. Oda was also involved in the efforts to reform religious life in England. He died in 958 and legendary tales afterwards were ascribed to him. Later he came to be regarded as a saint, and a hagiography was written in the late 11th or early 12th century.
