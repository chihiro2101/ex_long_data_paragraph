Electrical connector

==Physical construction==
In addition to the classes mentioned above, connectors are characterised by their pinout, method of connection, materials, size, contact resistance, insulation, mechanical durability, IP code, lifetime (number of cycles), and ease of use.
It is usually desirable for a connector to be easy to identify visually, rapid to assemble, inexpensive, and require only simple tooling. In some cases an equipment manufacturer might choose a connector specifically because it is not compatible with those from other sources, allowing control of what may be connected. No single connector has all the ideal properties for every application; the proliferation of types is a result of the diverse yet specific requirements of manufacturers.<ref name="zvei"></ref>
===Materials===
Electrical connectors essentially consist of two classes of materials: conductors and insulators. Properties important to conductor materials are contact resistance, conductivity, mechanical strength, formability, and resilience.<ref name="molex"></ref> Insulators must have a high electrical resistance, withstand high temperatures, and be easy to manufacture for a precise fit.
Electrodes in connectors are usually made of copper alloys, due to their good conductivity and malleability.<ref name="zvei" /> Alternatives include brass, phosphor bronze, and beryllium copper. The base electrode metal is often coated with another inert metal such as gold, nickel, or tin.<ref name="molex" /> The use of a coating material with good conductivity, mechanical robustness and corrosion resistance helps to reduce the influence of passivating oxide layers and surface adsorbates, which limit metal-to-metal contact patches and contribute to contact resistance. For example, copper alloys have favorable mechanical properties for electrodes, but are hard to solder and prone to corrosion. Thus, copper pins are usually coated with gold to alleviate these pitfalls, especially for analog signals and high reliability applications.<ref name="gold-tin"></ref><ref name="golden-rules"></ref>
Contact carriers that hold the parts of a connector together are usually made of plastic, due to its insulating properties. Housings or backshells can be made of molded plastic or metal.<ref name="zvei" />
===Failure modes===
The majority of connector failures result in intermittent connections or open contacts:<ref name="navy"></ref><ref>Normalized failure mode distributions were originally compiled from a combination of: MIL-HDBK-978, “NASA Parts Application Handbook”, 1991; MIL-HDBK-338, “Electronic Reliability Design Handbook”, 1994; “Reliability Toolkit: Commercial Practices Edition", Reliability Analysis Center (RAC), 1998; and “Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA)”, RAC, 1993.</ref>

==Methods of connection==
Whilst technically inaccurate, electrical connectors can be viewed as a type of adapter to convert between two connection methods, which are permanently connected at one end and (usually) detachable at the other end.<ref name="zvei" /> By definition, each end of this "adapter" has a different connection methode.g. the solder tabs on a male phone connector, and the male phone connector itself.<ref name="elliott" /> In this example, the solder tabs connected to the cable represent the permanent connection, whilst the male connector portion interfaces with a female socket forming a detachable connection.
There are many ways of applying a connector to a cable or device. Some of these methods can be accomplished without specialized tools. Other methods, while requiring a special tool, can assemble connectors much faster and more reliably, and make repairs easier.
===Plug and socket connectors===
Plug and socket connectors are usually made up of a male plug (typically pin contacts) and a female socket (typically receptacle contacts). Often, but not always, sockets are permanently fixed to a device as in a chassis connector , and plugs are attached to a cable. 
Plugs generally have one or more pins or prongs that are inserted into openings in the mating socket. The connection between the mating metal parts must be sufficiently tight to make a good electrical connection and complete the circuit. An alternative type of plug and socket connection uses hyperboloid contacts, which makes a more reliable electrical connection. When working with multi-pin connectors, it is helpful to have a pinout diagram to identify the wire or circuit node connected to each pin.
Some connector styles may combine pin and socket connection types in a single unit, referred to as a hermaphroditic connector.<ref name="taoe"></ref> These connectors includes mating with both male and female aspects, involving complementary paired identical parts each containing both protrusions and indentations. These mating surfaces are mounted into identical fittings that freely mate with any other, without regard for gender (provided that the size and type match).
Sometimes both ends of a cable are terminated with the same gender of connector, as in many Ethernet patch cables. In other applications the two ends are terminated differently, either with male and female of the same connector (as in an extension cord), or with incompatible connectors, which is sometimes called an adapter cable.
Plugs and sockets are widely used in various connector systems including blade connectors, breadboards, XLR connectors, car power outlets, banana connectors, and phone connectors.
====Jacks and plugs====
A jack is a connector that installs on the surface of a bulkhead or enclosure, and mates with its reciprocal, the plug.<ref name="jack-plug"></ref> According to the ASME,<ref name="asme-ref"></ref> the stationary (more fixed) connector of a pair is classified as a jack (denoted J), usually attached to a piece of equipment as in a chassis-mount or panel-mount connector. The movable (less fixed) connector is classified as a plug (denoted P),<ref name="asme-ref" /> designed to attach to a wire, cable or removable electrical assembly.<ref name="IEEE and ANSI, New York, NY"></ref> This convention is currently defined in ASME Y14.44-2008, which supersedes IEEE 200-1975, which in turn derives from the long-withdrawn MIL-STD-16 (from the 1950s), highlighting the heritage of this connector naming convention.<ref name="jack-plug" /> IEEE 315-1975 works alongside ASME Y14.44-2008 to define jacks and plugs.
The term jack occurs in several related terms:
* The registered jack or modular jack in RJ11, RJ45 and other similar connectors used for telecommunication and computer networking
* The telephone jack of manual telephone switchboards, which is the socket fitting the original telephone plug
* The phone jack common to many electronic applications in various configurations, sometimes referred to as a headphone jack
* The RCA jack, also known as a phono jack, common to consumer audiovisual electronics
* The EIAJ jack for consumer appliances requiring a power supply of less than 18.0&nbsp;volts
===Crimp-on connectors===
Crimped connectors are a type of solderless connection, using mechanical friction and uniform deformation to secure a connector to a pre-stripped wire (usually stranded).<ref name="ieee" /> Crimping is used in splice connectors, crimped multipin plugs and sockets, and crimped coaxial connectors. Crimping usually requires a specialised crimping tool, but the connectors are quick and easy to install and are a common alternative to solder connections or insulation displacement connectors. Effective crimp connections deform the metal of the connector past its yield point so that the compressed wire causes tension in the surrounding connector, and these forces counter each other to create a high degree of static friction. Due to the elastic element in crimped connections, they are highly resistant to vibration and thermal shock.<ref></ref>
Crimped contacts are permanent (i.e. the connectors and wire ends cannot be reused).<ref name="crimp-vs-solder"></ref>
Crimped plug-and-socket connectors can be classified as rear release or front release. This relates to the side of the connector where the pins are anchored:<ref name="nykcs-circular" />
* Front release contacts are released from the front (contact side) of the connector, and removed from the rear. The removal tool engages with the front portion of the contact and pushes it through to the back of the connector.
* Rear release contacts are released and removed from the rear (wire side) of the connector. The removal tool releases the contacts from the rear and pulls the contact out of the retainer.
===Soldered connectors===
Many plug and socket connectors are attached to a wire or cable by soldering conductors to electrodes on the back of the connector. Soldered joints in connectors are robust and reliable if executed correctly, but are usually slower to make than crimped connections.<ref name="ieee" /> When wires are to be soldered to the back of a connector, a backshell is often used to protect the connection and add strain relief. Metal solder buckets or solder cups are provided, which consist of a cylindrical cavity that an installer fills with solder before inserting the wire.<ref></ref>
When creating soldered connections, it is possible to melt the dielectric between pins or wires. This can cause problems because the thermal conductivity of metals causes heat to quickly distribute through the cable and connector, and when this heat melts plastic dielectric, it can cause short circuits or "flared" (conical) insulation.<ref name="crimp-vs-solder" /> Solder joints are also more prone to mechanical failure than crimped joints when subjected to vibration and compression.<ref name="hpacademy"></ref>
===Insulation-displacement connectors===
Since stripping insulation from wires is time-consuming, many connectors intended for rapid assembly use insulation-displacement connectors which cut the insulation as the wire is inserted.<ref name="ieee" /> These generally take the form of a fork-shaped opening in the terminal, into which the insulated wire is pressed, which cut through the insulation to contact the conductor. To make these connections reliably on a production line, special tools accurately control the forces applied during assembly. On small scales, these tools tend to cost more than tools for crimped connections.
Insulation displacement connectors are usually used with small conductors for signal purposes and at low voltage. Power conductors carrying more than a few amperes are more reliably terminated with other means, though "hot tap" press-on connectors find some use in automotive applications for additions to existing wiring.
A common example is the multi-conductor flat ribbon cable used in computer disk drives; to terminate each of the many (approximately 40) wires individually would be slow and error-prone, but an insulation displacement connector can terminate all the wires in a single action. Another very common use is so-called punch-down blocks used for terminating unshielded twisted pair wiring.
===Binding posts===
Binding posts are a single-wire connection method, where stripped wire is screwed or clamped to a metal electrode. Such connectors are frequently used in electronic test equipment and audio. Many binding posts also accept a banana plug.
===Screw terminals===
Screw connections are frequently used for semi-permanent wiring and connections inside devices, due to their simple but reliable construction. The basic principle of all screw terminals involves the tip of a bolt clamping onto a stripped conductor. They can be used to join multiple conductors,<ref></ref> to connect wires to a printed circuit board, or to terminate a cable into a plug or socket.<ref name="zvei" /> The clamping screw may act in the longitudinal axis (parallel to the wire) or the transverse axis (perpendicular to the wire), or both. Some disadvantages are that connecting wires is more difficult than simply plugging in a cable, and screw terminals are generally not very well protected from contact with persons or foreign conducting materials.

Terminal blocks (also called terminal boards or strips) provide a convenient means of connecting individual electrical wires without a splice or physically joining the ends. Since terminal blocks are readily available for a wide range of wire sizes and terminal quantity, they are one of the most flexible types of electrical connector available. One type of terminal block accepts wires that are prepared only by stripping a short length of insulation from the end. Another type, often called barrier strips, accepts wires that have ring or spade terminal lugs crimped onto the wires.
Printed circuit board (PCB) mounted screw terminals let individual wires connect to a PCB through leads soldered to the board.
===Ring and spade connectors===
thumb
The connectors in the top row of the image are known as ring terminals and spade terminals (sometimes called fork or split ring terminals). Electrical contact is made by the flat surface of the ring or spade, while mechanically they are attached by passing a screw or bolt through them. The spade terminal form factor facilitates connections since the screw or bolt can be left partially screwed in as the spade terminal is removed or attached. Their sizes can be determined by the gauge of the conducting wire, and the interior and exterior diameters.
===Blade connectors===
thumb
A blade connector is a type of single wire, plug-and-socket connection using a flat conductive blade that is inserted into a receptacle. Wires may be attached to male or female blade connectors by either crimping or soldering. Insulated and uninsulated varieties are available. In some cases the blade is an integral manufactured part of a component (such as a switch or a speaker unit), and the reciprocal connector is pushed onto the device's connector.
Common types of blade connectors are the Faston connectors and Lucar connectors. While Faston is a trademark of TE Connectivity (formerly Tyco Electronics), it has come into common usage. Faston connectors come in male and female types. They have been commonly used since the 1970s.

* Crocodile clip – conductive clamps used for temporary connections, e.g. jumper cables
* Board to board connectors – e.g. card-edge connectors or FPGA Mezzanine Card
* Twist-on wire connectors (e.g. wire nuts) – used in low-voltage power circuits for wires up to about 10&nbsp;AWG

An electrical connector is an electromechanical device used to join electrical conductors and create an electrical circuit.<ref name="ieee"></ref> Most electrical connectors have a genderi.e. the male component, called a plug, connects to the female component, or socket. The connection may be removable (as for portable equipment), require a tool for assembly and removal, or serve as a permanent electrical joint between two points.<ref name="RSM98"></ref> An adapter can be used to join dissimilar connectors.
Thousands of configurations of connectors are manufactured for power, data, and audiovisual applications.<ref name="elliott"></ref> Electrical connectors can be divided into four basic categories, differentiated by their function:<ref name="sparkfun"></ref>
* inline or cable connectors permanently attached to a cable, so it can be plugged into another terminal (either a stationary instrument or another cable)<ref name="connector-def"></ref>
* Chassis or panel connectors permanently attached to a piece of equipment so users can connect a cable to a stationary device
* PCB mount connectors soldered to a printed circuit board, providing a point for cable or wire attachment.<ref name="taoe" /> (e.g. pin headers, screw terminals, board-to-board connectors)
* Splice or butt connectors (primarily insulation displacement connectors) that permanently join two lengths of wire or cable
In computing, electrical connectors are considered a physical interface and constitute part of the physical layer in the OSI model of networking.
