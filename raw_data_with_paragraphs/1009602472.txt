Sex-positive movement

==Overview==
The terms and concept of sex-positive (German: sexuell positiv) (or, alternately sex-affirmative (sexuell bejahend)) and sex-negative (sexuell negativ) are generally attributed to Wilhelm Reich. His hypothesis was that some societies view sexual expression as essentially good and healthy, while others have a generally negative view of sexuality and seek to repress and control libido.<ref name=":32">Johansson, Warren. 1990. " urltoken Sex Negative, Sex Positive". In: Dynes WR (ed). Encyclopedia of Homosexuality. New York: Garland. p 1182–1183. .</ref> Other terms used to describe this concept include pro-sex, or pro-sexuality.<ref name=":32"/><ref>See, for example, Wilhelm Reich, The Invasion of Compulsory Sex-Morality (Der Einbruch der Sexualmoral, 1932); The Sexual Revolution (Die Sexualität im Kulturkampf, 1936).</ref><p>The sex-positive movement does not, in general, make moral or ethical distinctions between heterosexual or homosexual sex, or masturbation, regarding these choices as matters of personal preference.<ref name=":12"></ref> Other sex-positive positions include acceptance of BDSM and polyamory as well as asexuality.<ref name=":12" /> The sex-positive movement is also concerned with the teaching of Comprehensive sex education in schools.<ref name=":72"/></p>Some sex-positive theorists have analyzed sex-positivity in terms of the intersection of race/culture, gender, sexuality, class, nationality, and spirituality.<ref name=":12" /> Because of the vastness of the sex-positivity movement, it has been challenging for people to reach an agreed upon definition of the term "sex-positivity."<ref name=":12" /> Several definitions of sex-positivity have been offered by sexologist Carol Queen:<blockquote href="LGBT">Sex-positive, a term that's coming into cultural awareness, isn't a dippy love-child celebration of orgone – it's a simple yet radical affirmation that we each grow our own passions on a different medium, that instead of having two or three or even half a dozen sexual orientations, we should be thinking in terms of millions. "Sex-positive" respects each of our unique sexual profiles, even as we acknowledge that some of us have been damaged by a culture that tries to eradicate sexual difference and possibility.<ref>Queen, Carol (1997).

Pittsburgh (Cleis Press). </ref></blockquote><blockquote href="social movement">It’s the cultural philosophy that understands sexuality as a potentially positive force in one’s life, and it can, of course, be contrasted with sex-negativity, which sees sex as problematic, disruptive, dangerous. Sex-positivity allows for and in fact celebrates sexual diversity, differing desires and relationships structures, and individual choices based on consent.<ref>Queen, Carol; Comella, Lynn (2008).

==History of the sex-positivity movement==
Main articles: 1960s counterculture, Free love and Sexual revolution
In general use, the term sexual liberation is used to describe a socio-political movement, witnessed from the 1960s into the 1970s.<ref name=":4">David Allyn (2000). Make love, not war: the sexual revolution, an unfettered history. Warner Trade Publishing. .</ref> However, the term has been used at least since the late 1920s and is often attributed as being influenced by Freud's writing on sexual liberation and psychosexual issues, as well as Wilhelm Reich, who originally coined the term.<ref name=":32"/>
During the 1960s, a shift in the ways people thought about sexuality began to take place, heralding a period of de-conditioning in some circles away from old world antecedents, and developing new codes of sexual behavior, many of which have since been integrated into the mainstream.<ref>Time. 1967.</ref>
The 1960s also heralded a new culture of "free love" with millions of young people embracing the hippie ethos and preaching the power of love and the beauty of sex as a natural part of ordinary life. Hippies believed that sex and sexuality were natural biological phenomena which should be neither denied nor repressed. Changes in attitudes reflected a perception that traditional views on sexuality were both hypocritical and Chauvinism.
Sexual liberalization heralded a new ethos in experimenting with open sex in and outside of marriage, Birth control and the pill, public nudity, gay liberation, legalized abortion, interracial marriage, a return to natural childbirth, women's rights, and feminism.
Historian David Allyn argues that the sexual revolution was a time of "coming-out": about premarital sex, masturbation, erotic fantasies, pornography use, and sexuality.<ref name=":4" />
The term sex-positive first came in into use in the United States in the late 1990s with the founding of the Center for Sex and Culture in San Francisco, California and The Center for Sex Positive Culture in Seattle, Washington. In 2009 Sex Positive World began in Portland, Oregon. As of 2019 there are more than sixteen chapters of the nonprofit, in five countries.
== Sex-positive feminism ==
Sex-positive feminism, also known as pro-sex feminism, sex-radical feminism, or sexually liberal feminism, is a movement that began in the early 1980s. Some became involved in the sex-positive feminist movement in response to efforts by anti-pornography feminists, such as Catharine MacKinnon, Andrea Dworkin, Robin Morgan and Dorchen Leidholdt, to put pornography at the center of a feminist explanation of women's oppression.<ref>McElroy, W (2002). Liberty for Women: Freedom and Feminism in the Twenty-First Century. Chicago.</ref> This period of intense debate and acrimony between sex-positive and anti-pornography feminists during the early 1980s is often referred to as the "Feminist Sex Wars". Other sex-positive feminists became involved, not in opposition to other feminists, but in direct response to what they saw as patriarchal control of sexuality. Some authors who have advocated sex-positive feminism include Erika Lust, Ellen Willis, Susie Bright, Patrick Califia, Gayle Rubin, Carol Queen, Avedon Carol, Tristan Taormino, Diana Cage, Nina Hartley, and Betty Dodson.
Sex-positive feminism gives attention and acknowledges the importance of women's right to explore their bodies, sexual desire, and considers that sexual violence does not have to prevent the vindication of female desire.<ref name=":14"></ref> This movement demands the preservation of freedom and is against norms that are present in the sexual sphere. It also encourages and demands respect for variety and sexual dissidence without allowing itself to be harmed by intense anti-sex pressure from critics.<ref name=":14" />
Sex-positive feminism affirms that the discourse on women's sexual pleasure is silenced and marginalized in today's world.<ref></ref> Suppressing sexual dialogue with the supposed purpose of protecting women will only make them appear, according to this perspective, as the weaker sex. Women could have difficulty defending themselves with the classification as victims.<ref></ref> Over time, women have been classified as sexually passive, while men are recognized as sexually aggressive, so intercourse is considered an activity in which women "submit" to men's desire.<ref></ref> Another factor that continues to minimize female desire is the lack of consensus and research on it, a product of the social repression that women have had to endure over the centuries, which has lead to prejudices and generalizations.<ref name=":14" />
The sexual hierarchy system places heterosexuality, marriage and procreation at the top, which causes many women to fear from the sexual system that predominates in today's world.<ref></ref> Pleasure and sexuality are human rights that have been subjugated by an old-fashioned patriarchal; social construction.<ref></ref> Pro-sex feminism endeavours to cultivate sexuality as a site of political resistance. By using the "pleasure" factor in their favour, a significant contribution to the contemporary queer theory and politics has been made by using sexual and feminist "empowerment."<ref></ref>
== Opposition to the sex-positive movement ==
In opposition, some feminists believe sex positivity perceive disadvantage in women, but makes them easier to oppress<ref></ref> . Some, largely religious and particularly Judeo-Islamic-Christian, conservative opposition to sex-positivity sees human sexuality<ref name=":32"/> as a Fornication. Sexual acts are ranked hierarchically, with marital heterosexuality at the top of the hierarchy and masturbation, homosexuality, and other sexualities that deviate from societal expectations closer to the bottom.<ref name=":5">Rubin, Gayle (1984). Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality. In Carole S. Vance (Ed.), Pleasure and Danger: exploring female sexuality, pp. 267–319. Boston (Routledge & Kegan Paul). </ref> Medicine and psychiatry are said to have also contributed to sex-negativity, as they may designate some forms of sexuality that appear on the bottom of this hierarchy as being pathological (see Mental illness).<ref name=":5" />
Multiple feminists, such as Verkerk, Glick, and Bauer have criticized iterations of sex-positivity due to concerns about its effectiveness in challenging patriarchal norms.<ref name=":2"></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>The aforementioned feminists are "sex-critical" rather than "sex-negative.'<ref></ref> Scholar, Verkerk, acknowledges this by stating that "there are both harmful and liberating aspects of female sexual objectification and an accurate account of it must consider both.<ref></ref> Critics also take issue with the commodification of sexuality. Women are told both to invest in western standards of beauty and sexualization while also becoming a "consumable object themselves.'<ref name=":2" /> Sex-positive feminism has also been criticized for its emphasis on defeating the patriarchal gender norms through personal life choices, "rather than to dismantle, critique, expose, or challenge systematic discrimination and violence.<ref></ref>
The SlutWalk received criticism of its efficacy as an activist event. SlutWalk's purpose was to reclaim the word "slut” and counteract victim-blaming.<ref></ref> Despite the aim of the slut-walk, critics point out that the word, 'slut” had not been reclaimed.<ref name=":02"></ref> Rather, the word slut had become reified.<ref name=":02" /> Critics of the SlutWalk also suggest that the focus on revealing clothing "ultimately displaces the sombre and deadly issues of rape, domestic violence, sexual abuse, and street harassment."<ref name=":02" /> Lastly, the SlutWalk received criticism for lack of consideration of the hyper-sexualization that women of colour face.<ref></ref> Black Women's Blue Print penned an open letter to the slut-walk explaining that Black women cannot "afford to label" themselves as those in the slut-walk do 
== Sex-positivity in the 21st century ==
Since the early 2000s, the sex-positivity movement has continued to move closer into the mainstream.<ref name=":1" /> The advent of social media has made the sex-positivity movement more accessible by giving advocates of the movement platforms to promote their beliefs to a wide audience of followers. By extending the reach of the movement, sex-positivity has come to be inclusive of all sorts of sex and sexuality.<ref name=":13"/> Shame has become an area of particular interest within the sex-positivity movement, encouraging people to be more open and accepting of the different experiences people have with sex and sexuality.<ref></ref> Slut-shaming, prude-shaming and kink-shaming have all been challenged by the sex-positivity movement in an effort to allow all people to feel supported by and included in the movement.<ref></ref>
Pop culture has also played a large role in bringing the sex-positivity movement into the mainstream. Celebrities, including Lady Gaga, Amber Rose, Jessica Biel, Cameron Diaz, Taylor Swift and many others, have spoken publicly about their experiences with slut-shaming, sexuality, sexual assault, body acceptance and overall sexual health and responsibility.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
In 2018, Viceland, an American television station, began airing a sex-positive series called Slutever, hosted by Karley Sciortino.<ref></ref>
