Notting Hill Carnival

==Culture of the carnival==
Professor David Dabydeen has stated: 
<blockquote>
Carnival is not alien to British culture. Bartholomew Fair and Southwark Fair in the 18th century were moments of great festivity and release. There was juggling, pickpocketing, whoring, drinking, masquerade – people dressed up as the Archbishop of Canterbury and indulged in vulgar acts. It allowed people a space to free-up but it was banned for moral reasons and for the antiauthoritarian behaviour that went on like stoning of constables. Carnival allowed people to dramatise their grievances against the authorities on the street. Notting Hill Carnival single-handedly revived this tradition and is a great contribution to British culture."<ref name="culture">Professor David Dabydeen (August 2010), urltoken "Notting Hill Carnival", Yesu Persaud Centre for Caribbean Studies, University of Warwick.

This huge street festival attracts around one million people every year to Notting Hill and highlights Caribbean and Black diasporic cultures. Carnival uses influences from many other festivals around the world. Authors Julian Henriques and Beatrice Ferrara claim the festival draws mainly on the Trinidad Carnival as well as Crop Over, Canadian Caribana in Toronto and the US Labor Day Festival in Brooklyn. They also explain that Notting Hill Carnival is dually influenced by its diasporic cultures and its own country's influences. Henriques and Ferrara claim: "Carnival also has an explosive auditory impact due to its cacophony of sounds, in which soca, steel bands, calypso floats and sound systems mix and mingle in a multi-media and multi-sensory event" (Ferrara 132). This mixture of percussion, with emphasis on the beat and rhythm, leads to the extreme dancing in the streets for which Carnival is known, with citizens participating to the beat of the music, using mud and paint, dancing with the lower parts of the body. Henriques and Ferrara explain that people emphasize the "baseness" of the music, with everything being about the "bottom": the ground, the bottom of the body, and the bottom of the beat. The festival uses influences from the Jamaican dancehalls and British clubs, and the music is made loud enough for participants to feel the beat. The vibrations from the speakers allow people to better connect with the ground and bring their experience to another level.<ref></ref>
The authors of the same article further explain how Notting Hill Carnival also creates "territory". The parade route portion of the Carnival is where carnival floats play both recorded and live music and circulate the street, visualizing the boundaries of Carnival and marking its territory. The circulating movement of the Carnival parade is also an extending of space through sound. Territorializing the space through sounds of African beats, such as the pan, fosters a sense of identity and unity for the overall Carnival.<ref name="The Sounding">Henriques, Julian, and Beatrice Ferrara, "The Sounding of Notting Hill Carnival: Music as Space, Place and Territory."</ref>
The Carnival further diversified in 1984 with the appearance of the London School of Samba. Formed in that year, they were the first samba school in the UK and have paraded every year since (with the exception of 1992). Other samba schools have also paraded in Carnival, notably Acadêmicos de Madureira (1992–94), Quilombo do Samba (1993–2006) and the Paraiso School of Samba (since 2002). These groups are also notable as they sometimes parade with more than 200 performers, along with several decorated floats.
== Media coverage ==
Compared to other major music and art events such as Glastonbury Festival, Notting Hill Carnival has historically struggled to gain any live coverage outside of local media. The majority of carnival live broadcasts have been traditionally on BBC London radio (hitting a peak of coverage in the years of 2003 and 2004),<ref></ref><ref></ref> and on BBC Radio 1Xtra in more recent years.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
== Public order ==
Since the carnival did not have local authority permission, initial police involvement was aimed at preventing it taking place at all, which resulted in regular confrontation and riots. In 1976, the police had been expecting hostility due to what they deemed as trouble the year before. Consequently, after discovering pickpockets in the crowd, police took a heavy-handed approach against the large congregation of black people and it became "no-man's land". The 1600-strong police force violently broke up the carnival, with the arrest of 60 people. In the aftermath of the event, the carnival was portrayed in a very pointed way, with those aiding the riots lumped together as the "trouble-makers" responsible.<ref>Sarah Phillips, urltoken "Robert Golden's best photograph: the 1976 Notting Hill carnival riots", The Guardian, 13 March 2013.</ref>
After the 1976 Notting Hill Carnival the Police Federation pressed for the introduction of riot shields to protect police from objects thrown at them, although the shields also had the potential for aggressive use, as in 1977.<ref> urltoken "Riot shields – protective or aggressive?", New Scientist (Vol. 75, No. 1070), 22 September 1977, p. 739.</ref><ref>Roger Fowler,

A change of policy came after a confrontation in 1987, when the Carnival was allowed to take place with police adopting a more conciliatory approach. During the 2000 Carnival, two men were murdered; and future policing, while conciliatory, resulted in police deployment in large numbers: upwards of 11,000.
The Mayor of London's Carnival Review Group's report (published in 2004,<ref name=GLAReview/>) led to the parades taking a circular rather than linear route, but a recommendation to relocate the event in Hyde Park has been resisted.<ref>Chirag Trivedi, urltoken "Carnival's route to success", BBC News, 27 August 2004.</ref><ref name=IndyTimeline/> Some crimes associated with the carnival have taken place on its periphery: in 2007, two teenagers were wounded in separate shooting incidents just outside the carnival area on the Monday evening;<ref>Martina Smit, urltoken "Teen shootings mar Notting Hill Carnival", Guardian Series, 28 August 2007.</ref> however, police said there had been a decline in the number of carnival-linked arrests in comparison with the previous year.<ref>Matthew Moore and agencies, urltoken "Notting Hill Carnival ends with boy's shooting", The Telegraph, 28 August 2017.</ref>
The 2008 Carnival was marred by rioting at the very end of the weekend, involving about 40 youths battling with police, and more than 300 people were arrested.<ref>James Orr and agencies, urltoken "Notting Hill carnival ends with police battling troublemakers", The Guardian, 26 August 2008.</ref> The carnival has come under criticism for its cost to the London taxpayer, with the cost of policing the event more than £6,000,000; however, it is argued that this should be put into context since the carnival is estimated to bring approximately £93,000,000 into the local economy.<ref name=LDA /><ref>Pav Akhtar,

Despite talk of the 2011 Carnival being cancelled in the wake of the early 2011 England riots,<ref>Lloyd Bradley, urltoken "Don't confuse Notting Hill carnival with the riots" , U TV, 25 August 2011.</ref> it was seen as being relatively peaceful. Five people were arrested for a stabbing at Ladbroke Grove.<ref></ref> The victim was one of 86 people who were taken to hospital. In total 245 people were detained by police over the two days of the carnival.<ref></ref>
In recent years, there has been much less serious trouble, and it is generally viewed very positively by the authorities as a dynamic celebration of London's multicultural diversity, though dominated by the Caribbean culture. However, there has been controversy over the public safety aspects of holding such a well-attended event in narrow streets in a small area of London. A survey in 2016 commissioned by local Conservative MP Victoria Borwick found that "Nine out of ten residents living along the route of the Notting Hill Carnival flee their homes to escape the 'frightening and intimidating' event."<ref name="standard.co.uk">Pippa Crerar, urltoken "Notting Hill Carnival is 'frightening and drives residents from their homes'", London Evening Standard, 5 July 2016.</ref>
In 2016 there were over 450 arrests, and five people were hurt in four knife attacks; however, the commander in charge of policing carnival, David Musker, said that the number of arrests had been inflated by the new Psychoactive Substances Act 2016.<ref name="Gayle2016"></ref> Based on relative attendance figures, it has been said that crime rates for the Notting Hill Carnival and for Glastonbury or other music festivals are comparable,<ref>Greg Hurst, urltoken "Glastonbury Festival has worse crime rate", The Independent, 1 September 2000.</ref> and Ishmahil Blagrove, co-author of the book Carnival: A Photographic and Testimonial History of the Notting Hill Carnival, states: "Notting Hill Carnival, compared to Trinidad or Brazil, is one of the safest in the world – not just the second largest – it's one of the safest."<ref name="Gayle2016" />
A report in 2004 by the GLA Policing Policy Director, Lee Jasper, criticised authorities for not addressing safety issues involved in over a million people attending a small inner-city residential area, quoting the Met Police spokesman Dave Musker, who in November 2016 said: "Each year … we come exceptionally close to a major catastrophic failure of public safety where members of the public will suffer serious injury."<ref>Lee Jasper,

In the three weeks running up to the 2017 event, the police made 656 arrests, a pre-emptive crackdown.<ref name=Grierson>Jamie Grierson and Damien Gayle, urltoken "Notting Hill carnival arrests down after controversial crackdown", The Guardian, 29 August 2017.</ref> There were 313 arrests during the two days of the 2017 Carnival, compared with 454 the previous year.<ref name=Grierson /> On both days, a minute's silence in tribute to the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire was observed at 3&nbsp;pm by Carnival-goers, many of whom wore "green for Grenfell".<ref>Jemma Crew, urltoken "Notting Hill Carnival pays tribute to Grenfell fire victims with emotional minute silence", The Independent, 29 August 2017.</ref><ref>Lauren Pilat and Natasha Salmon, urltoken "Notting Hill Carnival-goers praised for Grenfell disaster response", London Evening Standard, 29 August 2017.</ref><ref> urltoken "Notting Hill Carnival: Thousands enjoy sound, samba and sun", BBC News, 29 August 2017.</ref>
During the 2018 event, due to the rising levels of in violent crime in London, police deployed metal detectors to prevent weapons being brought to the event. During the event, 30 police officers were injured in the line of duty, 36 weapons were confiscated and 373 arrests were made by the Metropolitan Police Service.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
Since 1987 there have been five deaths caused by violence at Notting Hill Carnival: 
* 30 August 1987 – Michael Augustine Galvin, 23, stallholder – stabbed.<ref></ref>
* 26 August 1991 – Nicholas John Hanscomb, 38, bled to death after being stabbed in the thigh.<ref> urltoken "Carnival victim's killer still being hunted" , This Is Lancashire, 25 August 2001.</ref><ref> urltoken "Tragic dad in carnival rap" , This Is Lancashire, 7 September 2000.</ref>

* 28 August 2000 – Abdul Munam Bhatti, 28; the police treated his attack as racially motivated by a gang of "mainly black males", as described by a witness.<ref> urltoken "'Racial motive' for carnival murder", BBC News, 5 September 2000.</ref> Nine men were sentenced for violent disorder in 2002.<ref></ref>
* 30 August 2004 – Lee Christopher Surbaran, 27, was shot by a gang using a machine pistol "for showing disrespect"; in 2005, three men were jailed for life for his murder.<ref>Alex Galbinski, urltoken "Gang trio jailed for murder", The Times Series (Newsquest), 2 August 2005.</ref>
==Transport==
