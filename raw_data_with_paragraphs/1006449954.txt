Mick Ronson

==Later work==
After leaving Bowie's entourage after the "Farewell Concert" in 1973,<ref></ref> Ronson released three solo albums. His solo debut Slaughter on 10th Avenue, featured a version of Elvis Presley's "Love Me Tender", as well as Ronson's most famous solo track, "Only After Dark".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> In addition, his sister, Margaret (Maggi) Ronson, provided the backing vocals for the set. Between this and the 1975 follow-up, Ronson had a short-lived stint with Mott the Hoople.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>
He then became a long-time collaborator with Mott's former leader Ian Hunter, commencing with the album Ian Hunter<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years"></ref> (UK No. 21) and featuring the UK Singles Chart No. 14 hit "Once Bitten, Twice Shy",<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums 2"></ref> including a spell touring as the Hunter Ronson Band.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> In 1980, the live album Welcome to the Club was released, including a couple of Ronson contributions, although it also contained a few studio-based tracks – one of which was a Hunter/Ronson composition. In 1974, Ronson secured the No. 2 spot from a reader's poll in Creem magazine as the best guitarist that year (with Jimmy Page taking first place), and Eric Clapton in third place after Ronson.<ref name="Creem magazine"></ref>
Ronson contributed guitar to the title track of the 1976 David Cassidy release Getting It in the Street. On 11 February 1977 the single "Billy Porter" (b/w "Seven Days") was released on RCA Victor Records, but did not chart. Roger Daltrey employed Ronson's guitar on his 1977 solo release One of the Boys. In 1979, Ronson and Hunter produced and played on the Ellen Foley debut album, Night Out, with "We Belong to the Night" and the hit single "What's a Matter Baby".
He also played guitar on Roger C Reale’s “Reptiles in Motion” album recorded in 1979 and only released in 2019 after the master tapes were acquired from the family of the original rights owners. The label Big Sound, based in Connecticut, had gone bust and the album remained unreleased for forty years.
In 1982, Ronson worked with John Mellencamp on his American Fool album, and in particular the song "Jack & Diane": <blockquote>"I owe Mick Ronson the hit song 'Jack & Diane'. Mick was very instrumental in helping me arrange that song, as I'd thrown it on the junk heap. Ronson came down and played on three or four tracks and worked on the American Fool record for four or five weeks. All of a sudden, for 'Jack & Diane', Mick said 'Johnny, you should put baby rattles on there.' I thought, 'What the fuck does put baby rattles on the record mean? So he put the percussion on there and then he sang the part 'let it rock, let it roll' as a choir-ish-type thing, which had never occurred to me. And that is the part everybody remembers on the song. It was Ronson's idea." (John Mellencamp, Classic Rock magazine, January 2008, p.61)</blockquote> Both "Jack & Diane" and American Fool topped their respective US Billboard charts.
Ronson was recruited to Midge Ure's band for Ure's Gift tour in 1985. After weeks of rehearsal, Ronson left the band due to financial disagreements and was replaced by Zal Cleminson.
In 1990, Ronson again collaborated with Hunter on the album YUI Orta, this time getting joint credit, as "Hunter/Ronson".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> One of the backing singers on the album was Carola Westerlund. While in Sweden Ronson wrote and produced three new songs with Estelle Millburne and Westerlund as EC2: "I'm So Sorry"/"Kiss Me" (1990), then a second single as ECII: "Passion" with a B-side cover of J. Kilette and K. Brown's "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles".
In 1993, he again appeared on a Bowie album, Black Tie White Noise,<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> playing on the track "I Feel Free", originally recorded by Cream. Ronson and Bowie had already covered this track live 20 years earlier, whilst touring as Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. He also played lead guitar on the Morrissey-penned "I Know It's Gonna Happen Someday".
His second and third solo albums were Play Don't Worry in 1975, and Heaven and Hull in 1994. The latter set was only partly completed at the time of Ronson's death, and was released posthumously. Artists involved with the album included Bowie, John Mellencamp, Joe Elliott, Ian Hunter, Chrissie Hynde, and Martin Chambers.
Besides Bowie and Hunter, Ronson went on to work as a musician, songwriter and record producer with many other acts. He did not restrict his influence behind the recording desk to just established acts. His production work appears on albums by more obscure artists, such as Payolas, Phil Rambow and Los Illegals, The Mundanes and Italian band Modà. Ronson produced The Visible Targets, a Seattle, Washington-based group, on their 1983 five track EP, "Autistic Savant". In 1985 he produced and played on the four song EP "Stillwell Avenue" with the NYC based band XDAVIS.
Ronson was also a member of Bob Dylan's "Rolling Thunder Revue" live band,<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> and can be seen both on and off-stage in the film of the tour.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years2"></ref> He made a connection with Roger McGuinn during this time, which led to his producing and contributing guitar and arrangements to McGuinn's 1976 solo album Cardiff Rose.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia 2"></ref>
In 1982, he participated on lead guitar in a short-lived band with Hilly Michaels on drums and Les Fradkin on bass guitar. One of their recordings from this group, "Spare Change", appeared on the Fradkin's 2006 album, Goin' Back. In 1987, Ronson made an appearance on a record by The Toll. Ronson played lead on the band's song, "Stand in Winter", from the album The Price of Progression.
In 1991, Ronson produced the Swedish cult band The Leather Nun's album, Nun Permanent, adding backing vocals and guitar overdubs on several tracks. At the end of the production, during a short visit to his sister in London, Ronson was diagnosed with cancer. In 1992 he produced Morrissey's album, Your Arsenal.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The same year, Ronson's final high-profile live performance was his appearance at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> He played on "All the Young Dudes" with Bowie and Hunter; and "Heroes" with Bowie. Ronson's final recorded session was as a guest on the 1993 Wildhearts album Earth vs the Wildhearts, where he played the guitar solo on the song "My Baby is a Headfuck".<ref name="The Story Behind The Song: My Baby Is A Headfuck by The Wildhearts"></ref> Liner notes for the Earth vs The Wildhearts album give credit to Mick Ronson for guitar on the track "My Baby Is A Headfuck" and the "album is dedicated to Mick Ronson".
==Personal life==
Ronson was married to Suzanne Fussey, a hairdresser, who worked for David Bowie at the same time that Ronson did.<ref></ref><ref></ref> They had a daughter, Lisa, a former vocalist with The Secret History. Ronson had two sons, Nicholas (born 1971) with his girlfriend Denise, as well as Joakim (born 1990) with Carola Westerlund.<ref></ref><ref name="About Mick"/>
==Death and legacy==
 
Ronson died of liver cancer on 29 April 1993, aged 46.<ref name="Liver"></ref> On 6 May, his funeral was held in a Mormon chapel in London, as he had been raised in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<ref name="Time"></ref> In his memory, the Mick Ronson Memorial Stage was constructed in Queen's Gardens, Hull.<ref></ref> In 2015, Steve Harley pledged to help raise funds for a new memorial to Ronson.<ref></ref> In April 2016, Harley played for free at the Hull City Hall to help kick start the appeal.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
A new guitar sculpture memorial to Ronson, designed by student Janis Skodins, was unveiled on 2 June 2017 in Hull's East Park, where Ronson used to work as a gardener.<ref></ref><ref></ref> As part of the Hull 2017 City Of Culture event programme, a show entitled "Turn And Face The Strange" was created to tell Ronson's story, comprising audio recordings of people who grew up with him in Hull.<ref></ref>
The show was written by Garry Burnett and Rupert Creed, and featured audio clips from friends and family, video, live narration and songs performed by a live rock band, which included ex-Rats bass player Keith 'Ched' Cheesman on guitar, Hull-born John Bentley (from Squeeze and a friend of Ronson's) on bass, plus John Cambridge, the ex-Rats and Hype drummer who introduced Ronson to Bowie, on drums. In August 2017 there were six sell-out performances,<ref></ref> at the Freedom Centre on Preston Road, close to where Ronson had grown up and is buried. There was a second run of the show, at the larger Hull Truck Theatre, which played to another six sell-out audiences, in February 2018, followed by a further ten show sell-out run in April and May 2019.<ref></ref> In August 2019, a new mural designed by artists Lydia Caprani and the Spray Creative group was completed in Bilton Grange.<ref></ref>

Bowie said in a 1994 interview that "Mick was the perfect foil for the Ziggy character. He was very much a salt-of-the-earth type, the blunt northerner with a defiantly masculine personality, so that what you got was the old-fashioned Yin and Yang thing. As a rock duo, I thought we were every bit as good as Mick and Keith or Axl and Slash. Ziggy and Mick were the personification of that rock n roll dualism."<ref></ref>
