Leopold and Loeb

== Prison ==
Leopold and Loeb initially were held at Joliet Prison. Although they were kept apart as much as possible, the two managed to maintain a friendship behind bars. Leopold later was transferred to Stateville Penitentiary, and Loeb was transferred there as well. Once reunited, the two expanded the prison school system, adding a high school and junior college curriculum.<ref name="prison">Leopold worked in the prison hospital and showed that he was the perfect model prisoner. He also organized the prison library. Leopold later said that all his good work later in life was a way of making up for his earlier crime. urltoken Life & Death In Prison by Marilyn Bardsley.

=== Loeb's death in prison ===
On January 28, 1936, Loeb was attacked by fellow inmate James Day with a straight razor in a shower room and died soon after in the prison hospital. Day claimed that Loeb had assaulted him, but he was unharmed while Loeb sustained more than 50 wounds, including defensive wounds on his arms and hands; his throat had been slashed from behind. News accounts suggested Loeb had propositioned Day; the authorities, perhaps embarrassed by publicity sensationalizing alleged decadent behavior in the prison, ruled that Day had been defending himself.<ref name="Linder" /><ref name="prison" />
While some have claimed that newsman Ed Lahey wrote this clever lead for the Chicago Daily News – "Richard Loeb, despite his erudition, today ended his sentence with a proposition"<ref></ref><ref></ref> – no evidence that this lead was ever published has been found, and actual copy from that date reads otherwise.<ref></ref> On February 19, 1936, in a column printed in the Syracuse Journal, Mark Hellinger wrote "I must tell you of the line that came to me from an unknown correspondent in Chicago. This anonymous contributor said he had the absolute low-down on the recent slaying of Dickie Loeb. Seems that Loeb made a slight mistake in grammar. He ended a sentence in a propositon." Other newspapers at the time appeared to praise Day, who was later tried and acquittal of Loeb's murder.<ref>Leopold and Loeb: The Crime of the Century p. 301</ref>
A sexual motive for the killing has been suggested. There is no evidence that Loeb was a sexual predator while in prison, but Day later was caught at least once in a prison sexuality.<ref>Leopold, Loeb & The Crime of the Century, pg 302</ref> In his autobiography Life Plus 99 Years, Leopold ridiculed Day's claim that Loeb had attempted to sexually assault him. This was echoed by the prison's Catholic chaplaina confidant of Loeb'swho said that it was more likely that Day had attacked Loeb after Loeb rebuffed his advances.<ref>Leopold, Loeb & The Crime of the Century, pg 293</ref>
=== Leopold's prison life ===
Although Leopold continued with his work in prison after Loeb's death, he suffered from depression. He became a model prisoner and made many significant contributions to improving conditions at Stateville Penitentiary. These included reorganizing the prison library, revamping the schooling system and teaching its students, and volunteer work in the prison hospital. In 1944, Leopold volunteered for the Stateville Penitentiary Malaria Study; he was deliberately inoculated with malaria pathogens and then subjected to several experimental malaria treatments.<ref>Higdon, H. The Crime of the Century (1975). New York, Putnams. ASIN: B000LZX0RO pp. 281-317.</ref>
In the early 1950s, author Meyer Levin, a classmate at the University of Chicago, requested Leopold's cooperation in writing a novel based on the Franks murder. Leopold responded that he did not wish his story told in fictionalized form, but offered Levin a chance to contribute to his own memoir, which was in progress. Levin, unhappy with that suggestion, went ahead with his book alone, despite Leopold's express objections. The novel, titled Compulsion,<ref>Levin, M. Compulsion(1956). New York, Simon & Schuster. </ref> was published in 1956. Levin portrayed Leopold (under the pseudonym Judd Steiner) as a brilliant but deeply disturbed teenager, psychologically driven to kill because of his troubled childhood and an obsession with Loeb. Leopold later wrote that reading Levin's book made him "physically sick.More than once I had to lay the book down and wait for the nausea to subside. I felt as I suppose a man would feel if he were exposed stark-naked under a strong spotlight before a large audience."<ref>In Nathan Leopold's Own Words. urltoken UMKC archive.

Leopold's autobiography Life Plus 99 Years was published in 1958,<ref>Leopold, N. Life Plus 99 Years (1958). New York, Doubleday & Co. </ref> as part of his campaign to win parole.<ref name=Baatz/> In beginning his account with the immediate aftermath of the crime, he engendered widespread criticism for his deliberate refusal (expressly stated in the book) to recount his childhood or to describe any details of the murder.<ref>Higdon H.

== Leopold's post-prison years ==
After 33 years and numerous unsuccessful parole petitions, Leopold was released in March 1958.<ref name="Linder" /><ref name="Freedom" /> In April, he attempted to set up the Leopold Foundation, to be funded by royalties from Life Plus 99 Years, "to aid emotionally disturbed, retarded, or delinquent youths."<ref name="Linder" /><ref name="Freedom" /><ref>Daily Defender; May 29, 1958; p9</ref> The State of Illinois voided his charter, however, on grounds that it violated the terms of his parole.<ref>Chicago Daily Tribune, July 16, 1958 p.23</ref>
In 1959, Leopold sought unsuccessfully to block production of the Compulsion (1959 film) on the grounds that Levin's book had privacy law, defamed him, profited from his life story, and "intermingled fact and fiction to such an extent that they were indistinguishable."<ref name="e-mailed comment" /><ref></ref> Eventually the Illinois Supreme Court ruled against him,<ref>Leopold v. Levin, 259 N.E.2d 250, 255–56 (Ill. 1970); GERTZ, supra note 48, at 166.</ref> holding that Leopold, as the confessed perpetrator of the "crime of the century" could not reasonably demonstrate that any book had injured his reputation.<ref name="Larson" /><ref name="e-mailed comment" />
The Brethren Service Commission, a Church of the Brethren affiliated program, accepted Leopold as a medical technician at its hospital in Puerto Rico. He expressed his appreciation in an article: "To me the Brethren Service Commission offered the job, the home, and the sponsorship without which a man cannot be paroled. But it gave me so much more than that, the companionship, the acceptance, the love which would have rendered a violation of parole almost impossible."<ref>"The Companionship, the Acceptance." The Brethren Encyclopedia. Vol. 2 1983. Print.</ref> He was known as "Nate" to neighbors and co-workers at Castañer General Hospital in Adjuntas, Puerto Rico, where he worked as a laboratory and X-ray assistant.<ref name="e-mailed comment"></ref>

== In popular culture ==
The Franks murder has inspired works of film, theatre, and fiction, including the 1929 play Rope by Patrick Hamilton, performed on BBC television in 1939,<ref></ref> and Alfred Hitchcock's Rope (film) in 1948.<ref name=Hinkson></ref> A fictionalized version of the events formed the basis of Meyer Levin's 1956 novel Compulsion and its 1959 film adaptation.<ref name=Hinkson /> In 1957, two more fictionalized novels were released: Nothing but the Night by James Yaffe and Little Brother Fate by Mary-Carter Roberts.<ref name=Baatz /> Never the Sinner, John Logan's 1988 play,<ref></ref> was based on contemporary newspaper accounts of the case, and included an explicit portrayal of Leopold and Loeb's sexual relationship.<ref></ref> In 2019, the story was fictionally retold again in the third season of The Sinner.<ref></ref>
In his book Murder Most Queer (2014), theater scholar Jordan Schildcrout examines changing attitudes toward homosexuality in various theatrical and cinematic representations of the Leopold and Loeb case.<ref></ref>
Other works influenced by the case include Richard Wright's 1940 novel Native Son, the Columbo episode "Columbo Goes To College" (1990), the drama Murdoch Mysteries, Tom Kalin's 1992 film Swoon, Michael Haneke's 1997 Austrian film Funny Games and the 2008 International remake, the 2002 black comedy R.S.V.P., Barbet Schroeder's Murder by Numbers (2002), Daniel Clowes's 2005 graphic novel Ice Haven, and Stephen Dolginoff's 2005 off-Broadway musical Thrill Me: The Leopold and Loeb Story.

The judge was persuaded, but according to his ruling, his decision was based on precedent and the youth of the accused; after 12 days on September 10, 1924, he sentenced both Leopold and Loeb to life imprisonment for the murder, and an additional 99 years for the kidnapping.<ref name="AmExper" /><ref name="geis" /> A little over a month later, Loeb's father died of heart failure.<ref>Daily Illini, University of Illinois, October 28, 1924</ref>
