Bloody Friday (1972)

==Background==
In late June and early July 1972, a British government delegation led by Secretary of State of Northern Ireland William Whitelaw held secret talks with the Provisional IRA leadership. As part of the talks, the IRA agreed to a temporary ceasefire beginning on 26 June. The IRA leaders sought a peace settlement that included a British withdrawal from Northern Ireland by 1975 and the release of republican prisoners. However, the British refused and the talks broke down.<ref></ref> The ceasefire came to an end on 9 July.
'Bloody Friday' was the IRA's response to the breakdown of the talks. According to the IRA's Chief of Staff, Seán Mac Stíofáin, the main goal of the bombing operation was to wreak financial harm.<ref name=bbc1> urltoken "Bloody Friday: What Happened". BBC News, 16 July 2002.

Voices From the Grave: Two Men's War in Ireland.

==The bombings==
The bombings happened during an 80-minute period on the afternoon of Friday 21 July. At least 24 bombs were planted; at least 20 exploded and the rest failed to detonate or were defused. At the height of the bombing, the middle of Belfast "resembled a city under artillery fire; clouds of suffocating smoke enveloped buildings as one explosion followed another, almost drowning out the hysterical screams of panicked shoppers".<ref>Moloney, A Secret History of the IRA, p.116</ref> According to The Guardian: "for much of the afternoon, Belfast was reduced to near total chaos and panic. Thousands streamed out of the stricken city … and huge traffic jams built up. All bus services were cancelled, and on some roads, hitch-hikers frantically trying to get away lined the pavements".<ref name=hoggart>Hoggart, Simon. urltoken "11 die in Belfast hour of terror". The Guardian, 22 July 1972.</ref>
Nine people were killed and a further 130 injured,<ref name=nio/> some of them horrifically mutilated.<ref name=bbc1/> Of those injured, 77 were women and children.<ref name=moloney302>Moloney, A Secret History of the IRA, p.302</ref> All of the deaths were caused by two of the bombs: at Oxford Street bus depot, and at Cavehill Road. The Oxford Street bomb killed two British soldiers and four Ulsterbus employees. One of these employees was a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) reservist; one was an Ulster loyalist paramilitary; and the other two were civilians. The Cavehill Road bomb killed three civilians.

The car had been stolen from outside Inglis’ bakery in Eliza Street in the Markets area of Belfast between 6.15am and when the owner discovered it missing at 2.30pm on Friday, July 21, 1972, whilst the owner was at work in the bakery.
A telephoned warning was sent to the RUC 22 minutes before the bomb exploded. According to the RUC, the line to the station was busy, so they asked the Army to send a patrol. The patrol arrived in an armoured vehicle and began clearing the area. Rather than evacuating, some Ulsterbus workers had begun searching for the bomb.<ref>Bloody Friday, BBC documentary, 2012</ref> While this was ongoing, it exploded. Two British soldiers, Stephen Cooper (19) and Philip Price (27), were killed outright. Four Ulsterbus workers, all Protestants, were killed: Robert 'Jackie' Gibson (45), Thomas Killops (39), William Irvine (18) and William Crothers (15).

===Warnings===
The IRA's Belfast Brigade claimed responsibility for the bombings and said that it had given warnings to the security forces before the bombs exploded. It said that the Public Protection Agency, the Samaritans and the press "were informed of bomb positions at least 30 minutes to one hour before each explosion".<ref name=utv1> urltoken "Bloody Friday 'never forgotten' by victims" . UTV News, 19 July 2012. Retrieved 19 July 2012.</ref> Mac Stíofáin said that "It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time" and alleged that the warnings for the two bombs that claimed lives were deliberately ignored by the British for "strategic policy reasons".<ref name=bbc1/>
The Public Protection Agency said it received telephoned warnings of the two bombs that claimed lives, and immediately passed the warnings on to the security forces. It said it received a warning of the Cavehill Road bomb an hour and eight minutes before the explosion, and a warning of the Oxford Street bomb 22 minutes before the explosion.<ref>Pringle, Peter. "Mystery of Bloody Friday's lost warnings". The Sunday Times (London), 30 July 1972.</ref> According to an article in The Guardian, a warning of the Oxford Street bomb was heard over military radio almost an hour before the explosion.<ref name=hoggart/>
The security forces denied that they wilfully ignored warnings and said they were overstretched by the sheer number of bombs and bomb warnings. The security forces also received hoax warnings, which "added to the chaos in the streets".<ref name=cainsum> urltoken Bloody Friday: Summary. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN)</ref> The RUC and British Army only effectively cleared a small number of areas before the bombs went off. Furthermore, because of the large number bomb threats in the confined area of Belfast city centre, people evacuated from the site of one bomb were mistakenly moved into the vicinity of other bombs.
==Immediate aftermath==
After the bombings there was a two-hour emergency meeting at Stormont Castle. It was attended by William Whitelaw, the British government's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland; Peter Carrington, Secretary of State for Defence; Harry Tuzo, the British Army's commander in Northern Ireland; David Corbett, the acting chief of the RUC; and other advisers.<ref name=hoggart/> Whitelaw announced that immediate action would be taken against the IRA. Unionist politicians demanded a further wave of arrests and internment of IRA suspects.<ref name=hoggart/>
On Friday night, 2,000 British troops began carrying out raids on the homes of IRA suspects in Belfast. They arrested 58 people and seized bomb-making equipment, explosives and ammunition. The raids sparked gun battles. In the Markets area, IRA member Joseph Downey (23) was shot dead<ref name=mckittrick233-34>McKittrick, Lost Lives, p.234</ref> and five other people were wounded. The British Army claim to have hit at least three gunmen.<ref name=hoggart/> In Ardoyne, at least 900 shots were fired at soldiers and the British Army claim to have hit at least five gunmen. In Andersonstown, two soldiers were shot and they claim to have hit one gunman. Shots were also fired at the security force bases on Oldpark Road, Glenravel Street and York Street.<ref>The Troubles magazine, issue 15, p.68</ref> The raids continued over the next three days. More than 100 people were arrested, weapons were seized in Belfast and Portadown, and barricades were demolished in Belfast and Armagh.<ref>The Troubles magazine, issue 15, p.71</ref>
Loyalist paramilitaries also reacted to the bombings. On Friday night, members of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) took to the streets in Protestant areas and began carrying out 'patrols' and setting up checkpoints.<ref name=hoggart/> Four Catholic civilians were killed by loyalists that night, allegedly in retaliation for the bombings. Joseph Rosato (59) was shot by gunmen who called at his home in the Oldpark district. Patrick O'Neill (26) and Rosemary McCartney (27) were found shot dead in a car on Forthriver Road. Another, Francis Arthurs (34) was found shot dead in a car on Liffey Street.<ref name=mckittrick233-34/>
==Reactions and consequences==
According to former RUC officer Jack Dale, a large group of people in the republican Markets area had "jeered and shouted and yelled" as if each explosion was "a good thing".<ref name="NewsLetter"> urltoken NewsLetter – SF should help solve Bloody Friday says MPs</ref>
Speaking in the House of Commons on 24 July, William Whitelaw called the bombings "appallingly bloodthirsty". He also drew attention to the Catholic victims, and mentioned the revulsion in the Republic of Ireland and elsewhere. Leader of the Opposition Harold Wilson described the events as "a shocking crime against an already innocent population". The Irish Times wrote, "The chief injury is not to the British Army, to the Establishment or to big business but to the plain people of Belfast and Ireland. Anyone who supports violence from any side after yesterday's events is sick with the same affliction as those who did the deed". Television images of fire-fighters shovelling body parts into plastic bags at the Oxford Street bus station were the most shocking of the day.<ref> urltoken Select Committee on Defence, 2 July 2003</ref><ref> urltoken "Cry for reconciliation which should be welcomed by all". Irish Independent, 17 July 2002.</ref>
Twenty-five years later, a police officer who had been at Oxford Street bus station described to journalist Peter Taylor the scene he came upon in the wake of the bombing
<blockquote>The first thing that caught my eye was a torso of a human being lying in the middle of the street. It was recognisable as a torso because the clothes had been blown off and you could actually see parts of the human anatomy. One of the victims was a soldier I knew personally. He'd had his arms and legs blown off and some of his body had been blown through the railings. One of the most horrendous memories for me was seeing a head stuck to the wall. A couple of days later, we found vertebrae and a rib cage on the roof of a nearby building. The reason we found it was because the seagulls were diving onto it. I've tried to put it at the back of my mind for twenty-five years.<ref>Taylor, Peter (1999). Loyalists. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. p.108. </ref></blockquote>
In The Longest War, author Kevin Kelley wrote that the IRA "had done irreparable damage to their cause – in Britain, abroad, and in their own communities. They had handed Britain a perfect propaganda opportunity – Bloody Friday could not be equated with Bloody Sunday. Nearly everyone was sickened by the slaughter".<ref name="McKittrick, Lost Lives, p.231"/>
Ten days after the bombings, the British Army launched Operation Motorman, in which it re-took IRA-controlled areas in Belfast and Derry. It was the biggest British military operation since the Suez Crisis of 1956. In his memoirs, Whitelaw wrote "The re-establishment of control required a major military operation. Fortunately … the IRA leaders gave me further propaganda assistance. While the planning for Operation Motorman was in progress they unleashed a savage bombing operation in the centre of Belfast".<ref name="McKittrick, Lost Lives, p.230">McKittrick, Lost Lives, p.230</ref>

===Irish republican reaction===
For the IRA, it was "an operation gone awry".<ref>White, Robert William. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh: The Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary. Indiana University Press, 2006. p.190</ref> IRA Chief of Staff, Seán Mac Stíofáin, said the civilian casualties "compromised the intended effect" of the bombings.<ref name="McKittrick, Lost Lives, p.230"/> Brendan Hughes, Officer Commanding of the IRA's Belfast Brigade, viewed the attack as a disaster. He described his reaction in an interview organised by Boston College:
<blockquote>I was the operational commander of the "Bloody Friday" operation. I remember when the bombs started to go off, I was in Leeson Street, and I thought, "There's too much here". I sort of knew that there were going to be casualties, either because the Brits could not handle so many bombs or they would allow some to go off because it suited them to have casualties. I feel a bit guilty about it because, as I say, there was no intention to kill anyone that day. I have a fair deal of regret that "Bloody Friday" took place . a great deal of regret . If I could do it over again I wouldn't do it.<ref>Moloney, Voices from the Grave, p.105</ref></blockquote>
In July 2002, the Provisional IRA issued a statement of apology to An Phoblacht, which read:

Bloody Friday is the name given to the bombings by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Belfast, Northern Ireland on 21 July 1972, during the Troubles. At least twenty bombs exploded in the space of eighty minutes, most within a half hour period. Most of them were car bombs and most targeted infrastructure, especially the transport network. Nine people were killed: five civilians, two British Armys, a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) reservist, and an Ulster Defence Association (UDA) member, while 130 were injured.<ref name=nio> urltoken Northern Ireland Office news-sheet. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN)</ref> The IRA said it sent telephoned warnings at least thirty minutes before each explosion and said that the security forces wilfully ignored some of the warnings for its own ends. The security forces said that was not the case and said they were overstretched by the sheer number of bombs and bomb threat.
The bombings were partly a response to the breakdown of talks between the IRA and the British government. Since the beginning of its campaign in 1970, the IRA had carried out a bombing campaign against economic, military and political targets in Northern Ireland and less often elsewhere.<ref name="em"></ref> It carried out 1,300 bombings in 1972.<ref></ref> However, Bloody Friday was a major setback for the IRA and there was a backlash against the organization. Immediately after the bombings, the security forces carried out raids on the homes of republicans. Ten days later, the British Army launched Operation Motorman, in which it re-took the no-go areas controlled by Republicans. Loyalist paramilitaries also reacted to the bombings by carrying out 'revenge' attacks on Catholic civilians.
On the thirtieth anniversary of the bombings, the IRA formally apologized to the families of all the civilians it had killed and injured.<ref name=irastatement> urltoken Irish Republican Army statement, 16 July 2002.
