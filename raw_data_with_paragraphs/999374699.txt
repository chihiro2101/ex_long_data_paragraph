Maeve Binchy

==Biography==
===Overview===
====Early life and family====
Anne Maeve Binchy<ref name="dudgeon"/> was born on 28 May 1939<ref name="dudgeon"/> in Dalkey, the oldest of the four children of William and Maureen (née Blackmore) Binchy. Her siblings include one brother, William Binchy, Regius Professor of Laws at Trinity College, Dublin, and two sisters: Irene "Renie" (who predeceased Binchy), and Joan, Mrs Ryan.<ref></ref> Her uncle was the historian D. A. Binchy (1899–1989). Educated at St Anne's (then located at No 35 Clarinda Park East), Dún Laoghaire, and later at Holy Child Killiney,<ref name="Maeve Binchy"></ref> she went on to study at University College Dublin (where she earned a bachelor's degree in history),<ref name="Guardian"/><ref name="EB"/><ref name="Fox, Margalit"></ref> she worked as a teacher<ref name="Guardian"/><ref></ref> of French, Latin, and history at various girls' schools,<ref name="Maeve Binchy"/><ref name="Fox, Margalit"/><ref name="Schudel, Matt"></ref> then a journalist at The Irish Times,<ref name="Guardian"/> and later became a writer of novels, Short story, and dramatic works.<ref name="Maeve Binchy Filmography"></ref><ref name="rte.ie"></ref><ref name="Anne-Marie Casey"></ref>
In 1968, her mother died of cancer aged 57. After Binchy's father died in 1971, she sold the family house and moved to a bedsit in Dublin.<ref name="Tel o"></ref>
====Israel====
Her parents were Catholics and Binchy attended a convent school. However, a trip to Israel profoundly affected both her career and her faith. She later said to Vulture:
<blockquote>In 1963, I worked in a Jewish school in Dublin, teaching French with an Irish accent to kids, primarily Lithuanians. The parents there gave me a trip to Israel as a present. I had no money, so I went and worked in a kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was going out to the Middle East by myself. I wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. So I thought, It's not so hard to be a writer. Just write a letter home. After that, I started writing other travel articles.<ref name="Maeve Binchy Filmography"/><ref name="Ebiri, Bilge"></ref></blockquote>
One Sunday, attempting to locate where the Last Supper is supposed to have occurred, she climbed a mountainside to a cavern guarded by a Brooklyn-born Israeli soldier. She wept with despair. The soldier asked, "What'ya expect, ma'am – a Renaissance table set for 13?" She replied, "Yes! That's just what I did expect." This experience caused her to renounce her Catholic faith, and eventually become agnostic.<ref></ref>
====Marriage====
Binchy, described as "six feet tall, rather stout, and garrulous",<ref name="Schudel, Matt"/> although she actually grew to 6'1",<ref name="dudgeon"/> said in an interview with Gay Byrne of The Late Late Show that, growing up in Dalkey, she never felt herself to be attractive; "as a plump girl I didn't start on an even footing to everyone else".<ref name="Lynch, Donal"></ref> After her mother's death, she expected to lead a life of spinsterhood, saying "I expected I would live at home, as I always did." She continued, "I felt very lonely, the others all had a love waiting for them and I didn't."<ref name="Lynch, Donal"/>
However, when recording a piece for Woman's Hour in London she met children's author Gordon Snell, then a freelance producer with the BBC.<ref name="Lynch, Donal"/> Their friendship blossomed into a cross-border romance, with her in Ireland and him in London, until she eventually secured a job in London through The Irish Times.<ref name="Lynch, Donal"/> She and Snell married in 1977 and, after living in London for a time, moved to Ireland. They lived together in Dalkey, not far from where she had grown up, until Binchy's death.<ref name="official"/> She said of him that he was a "writer, a man I loved and he loved me and we got married and it was great and is still great. He believed I could do anything, just as my parents had believed all those years ago, and I started to write fiction and that took off fine. And he loved Ireland, and the fax was invented so we writers could live anywhere we liked, instead of living in London near publishers.<ref name=irish_times_death/>
====Letter to the president====
Files in Ireland's National Archives, released to the public in 2006, feature a request from Maeve Binchy to President Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh asking if he could "receive" her. She wrote, "I know you are extremely busy but I often see in the paper that you 'received' so-and-so and was wondering very simply could I be received too." This request came while she was working for The Irish Times in London in 1975.<ref></ref>
===Health===
In 2002, Binchy suffered health problems related to a heart condition, which inspired her to write Heart and Soul. The book, about what Binchy terms "a heart failure clinic" in Dublin and the people involved with it, reflects many of her own experiences and observations in the hospital.<ref name="Maeve Binchy Filmography"/><ref name="Ebiri, Bilge"/><ref></ref> Towards the end of her life, Binchy's website stated "My health isn't so good these days and I can't travel around to meet people the way I used to. But I'm always delighted to hear from readers, even if it takes me a while to reply."<ref name=bbc_death/>
===Death===
Binchy died on 30 July 2012. She was 73 and had suffered from various maladies, including painful osteoarthritis.<ref></ref> As a result of the arthritis she had a hip operation.<ref></ref> A month before her death she suffered a severe spinal infection (acute discitis),<ref name="dudgeon"/> and finally succumbed to a heart attack.<ref name=bbc_death/><ref name=rte_death></ref> Gordon was by her side when she died in a Dublin hospital.<ref name=irish_times_death/> Just ahead of that evening's Tonight with Vincent Browne and TV3's late evening news, Vincent Browne and then Alan Cantwell, who respectively anchor these shows, announced to Irish television viewers that Binchy had died earlier that evening.<ref name=journal_death/>
Immediate media reports described Binchy as "beloved", "Ireland's most well-known novelist" and the "best-loved writer of her generation".<ref name=irish_times_death/><ref name=journal_death></ref> Fellow writers mourned their loss, including Ian Rankin,<ref name=guardian_death></ref> Jilly Cooper,<ref></ref> Anne Rice,<ref name=independent_twitter_death></ref> and Jeffrey Archer.<ref></ref> Politicians also paid tribute. President Michael D. Higgins stated: "Our country mourns."<ref name=independent_twitter_death/> Taoiseach Enda Kenny said, "Today we have lost a national treasure."<ref></ref> Minister of State for Disability, Equality and Mental Health Kathleen Lynch, appearing as a guest on Tonight with Vincent Browne, said Binchy was, for her (Lynch's) money, as worthy an Irish writer as James Joyce or Oscar Wilde, and praised her for selling so many more books than they managed.<ref></ref>
In the days after her death tributes were published from such writers as John Banville,<ref></ref> Roddy Doyle,<ref></ref> and Colm Tóibín.<ref></ref> Banville contrasted Binchy with Gore Vidal, who died the day after her, observing that Vidal "used to say that it was not enough for him to succeed, but others must fail. Maeve wanted everyone to be a success." Numerous tributes appeared in publications on both sides of the Atlantic, including The Guardian and CBC News.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
Shortly before her death, Binchy told The Irish Times: "I don't have any regrets about any roads I didn't take. Everything went well, and I think that's been a help because I can look back, and I do get great pleasure out of looking back&nbsp;. I've been very lucky and I have a happy old age with good family and friends still around."<ref name=irish_times_death></ref> Just before dying, she read her latest short story at the Dalkey Book Festival.<ref name=guardian_death/> She once said she would like to die ".&nbsp;on my 100th birthday, piloting Gordon and myself into the side of a mountain".<ref></ref>
Despite being an agnostic, Binchy was given a traditional Requiem Mass which took place at the Church of the Assumption, in her hometown of Dalkey. She was later cremated at Mount Jerome Cemetery and Crematorium.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
==Work==
===Journalism===
The New York Times reports: Binchy's "writing career began by accident in the early 1960s, after she spent time on a kibbutz in Israel. Her father was so taken with her letters home that "he cut off the ‘Dear Daddy’ bits,” Ms. Binchy later recounted, and sent them to an Irish newspaper, which published them."<ref name="Fox, Margalit"/> Donal Lynch observed of her first paying journalism role: the Irish Independent "was impressed enough to commission her, paying her £16, which was then a week-and-a-half's salary for her."<ref name="Lynch, Donal"/>
 
In 1968, Binchy joined the staff at The Irish Times, and worked there as a writer, columnist, the first Women's page editor<ref name="Lynch, Donal"/> then the London editor,<ref></ref> later reporting for the paper from London before returning to Ireland.<ref name="Fox, Margalit"/>
Binchy's first published book is a compilation of her newspaper articles titled My First Book. Published in 1970, it is now out of print. As Binchy's bio posted at Read Ireland describes: "The Dublin section of the book contains insightful case histories that prefigure her novelist's interest in character. The rest of the book is mainly humorous, and particularly droll is her account of a skiing holiday, 'I Was a Winter Sport.'"<ref></ref><ref></ref>
===Literature===
In all, Binchy published 16 novels, four short-story collections, a play and a novella.<ref></ref> A 17th novel, A Week in Winter, was published posthumously.<ref></ref> Her literary career began with two books of short stories: Central Line (1978) and Victoria Line (1980). She published her debut novel Light a Penny Candle in 1982. In 1983, it sold for the largest sum ever paid for a first novel: £52,000. The timing was fortuitous, as Binchy and her husband were two months behind with the mortgage at the time.<ref name="Books Obituaries: Maeve Binchy"></ref> However, the prolific Binchy – who joked that she could write as fast as she could talk – ultimately became one of Ireland's richest women.<ref name="Books Obituaries: Maeve Binchy"/><ref></ref>
Her first book was rejected five times. She would later describe these rejections as "a slap in the face . It's like if you don't go to a dance you can never be rejected but you'll never get to dance either".<ref name=bbc_death/>
Most of Binchy's stories are set in Ireland, dealing with the tensions between urban and rural life, the contrasts between England and Ireland, and the dramatic changes in Ireland between World War II and the present day. Her books have been translated into 37 languages.<ref name=bbc_death></ref>
While some of Binchy's novels are complete stories (Circle of Friends, Light a Penny Candle), many others revolve around a cast of interrelated characters (The Copper Beech, Silver Wedding, The Lilac Bus, Evening Class, and Heart and Soul). Her later novels, Evening Class, Scarlet Feather, Quentins, and Tara Road, feature a cast of recurring characters.
Binchy announced in 2000 that she would not tour any more of her novels, but would instead be devoting her time to other activities and to her husband, Gordon Snell. Five further novels were published before her death: Quentins (2002), Nights of Rain and Stars (2004), Whitethorn Woods (2006), Heart and Soul (2008), and Minding Frankie (2010).<ref name="official" /> Her final novel, A Week in Winter, was published posthumously in 2012.<ref name="Fox, Margalit"/><ref name=LAT></ref> In 2014 a collection of 36 unpublished short stories that she had written over a period of decades was published under the title Chestnut Street.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
Binchy wrote several dramas specifically for radio and the silver screen. Additionally, several of her novels and short stories were adapted for radio, film, and television.<ref name="Maeve Binchy Filmography"/><ref name="rte.ie"/><ref name="Anne-Marie Casey"/> (See #Films.2C radio.2C and television.)
==Public appearances==
Binchy appeared on the The Late Late Show on Saturday 20 March (based on chronology this would have been 1982) in connection with the publication of the Dublin 4 short story collection.<ref name=Maeve-letter-earnings/> "Then the conversation broadened and Gay Byrne asked about some aspects of my work, the royal weddings", Binchy later recalled in a letter she sent to the programme.<ref name=Maeve-letter-earnings/> "I said how much I had liked Charles's wedding and hated Anne's - about covering the election in Ireland and how I had been one of the very few journalists watching FitzGerald and Haughey on the night of the Great Debate."<ref name=Maeve-letter-earnings/>
Following the publication of Light a Penny Candle, the programme sought Binchy to reappear to explain her success.<ref name=Maeve-letter-earnings/> In advance of her appearance she sent Mary O'Sullivan, who was working on the programmme, a letter (the same one referred to above) setting out her earnings in some detail, since Binchy thought this would be of relevance.<ref name=Maeve-letter-earnings> Print edition, with original title of "Big Read: The circle of life of Circle of Friends", included "Maeve's letter explaining how she earned her new-found success", which Binchy sent to Mary O'Sullivan before an appearance on The Late Late Show on which O'Sullivan was working.</ref> She received an initial 5,000 Irish pounds for Light a Penny Candle.<ref name=Maeve-letter-earnings/> The paperback rights were sold for a British record for a first novel with a prepublication advance of £52,000 from Coronet.<ref name=Maeve-letter-earnings/> Viking Press paid Binchy $200,000 for the U.S. hardcover edition.<ref name=Maeve-letter-earnings/> The Literary Guild of America paid a further $50,000.<ref name=Maeve-letter-earnings/> The French publisher paid Binchy 50,000 francs.<ref name=Maeve-letter-earnings/> Binchy wrote to O'Sullivan, "I thought it would be better if you knew the exact figures, then you could decide what was and what was not relevant".<ref name=Maeve-letter-earnings/> O'Sullivan republished the letter in the Sunday Independents Living supplement in 2020 but mentioned that the last page, which followed on from Binchy referring to what she intended to do with all her money, was missing.<ref name=Maeve-letter-earnings/>
In 1994, Binchy appeared on Morningside with Peter Gzowski.<ref></ref>
In 1999, Binchy appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show.<ref></ref> In 2009, she appeared on The Meaning of Life, also presented by Gay Byrne.<ref></ref> Binchy and her husband had a cameo appearance together in Fair City on 14 December 2011, during which the couple dined in The Hungry Pig.<ref></ref>
