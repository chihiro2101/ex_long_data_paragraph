Gloria Vanderbilt

==Early life==
Vanderbilt was born on February 20, 1924, in Manhattan, New York City, the only child of railroad heir Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt of the Vanderbilt family<ref></ref><ref name=Reggie></ref> and his second wife, Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt.<ref></ref><ref></ref> When Vanderbilt was born, her father was heard to exclaim in delight, "It is fantastic how Vanderbilt she looks! See the corners of her eyes, how they turn up?"<ref>Vanderbilt II, Arthur T., "Fortune's Children: The Fall of the House of Vanderbilt". Morrow: 1989, 340.</ref> She was baptized in the Episcopal church by Bishop Herbert Shipman as Gloria Laura Vanderbilt. After her father's death, she was confirmed and raised in the Catholic Church, to which her mother belonged.<ref></ref> From her father's first marriage to Cathleen Neilson, she had one elder half-sister, Cathleen Vanderbilt.<ref name="Death"></ref>
Upon their father's death from cirrhosis when Vanderbilt was 18 months old, she and her half-sister became heiresses to a half share each in a $5&nbsp;million trust fund, equivalent to $&nbsp;million in value.<ref></ref> The control of Vanderbilt's share while she was a minor belonged to her mother, who traveled to and from Paris for years, taking her daughter with her. They were accompanied by a beloved nanny—Emma Sullivan Kieslich,<ref>Vanderbilt II, Arthur T., 346.</ref> whom young Gloria had named "Dodo"—who would play a tumultuous part in the child's life,<ref></ref> and her mother's identical twin sister, Thelma, who was the mistress of the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) during this time.<ref name="Happy"/> As a result of her spending habits, her mother's use of finances was scrutinized by the child's paternal aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. A sculptor and philanthropist, Whitney wanted custody of her niece, which resulted in a custody trial.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The trial was so scandalous that at times the judge would make everyone leave the room so as to listen to what young Vanderbilt had to say without anyone influencing her. Some people heard weeping and wailing inside the court room. Testimony was heard depicting Vanderbilt's mother as an unfit parent, including an allegation from a maid of a lesbian affair with a member of the British royal family.<ref name=AP></ref> Vanderbilt's mother lost the battle and Vanderbilt became the ward of her aunt Gertrude.<ref name="Happy"></ref>
Litigation continued, however. Vanderbilt's mother was forced to live on a drastically reduced portion of her daughter's trust, which was worth more than $4&nbsp;million at the end of 1937,<ref name="life1938011717"></ref> equivalent to $&nbsp;million in value. Visitation was also closely watched to ensure that Vanderbilt's mother did not exert any undue influence upon her daughter with her supposedly "raucous" lifestyle. Vanderbilt was raised amidst luxury at her aunt Gertrude's mansion in Old Westbury, Long Island, surrounded by cousins her age who lived in houses circling the vast estate, and in New York City.<ref name="auto"></ref>
The story of the trial was told in the 1980 Barbara Goldsmith book Little Gloria. Happy at Last and a 1982 NBC miniseries based on it,<ref name=AP/> which was nominated for six Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award.<ref></ref> Actress Jennifer Dundas played Gloria.<ref></ref>
Vanderbilt attended the Greenvale School on Long Island; Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut; and then the Wheeler School<ref></ref><ref></ref> in Providence, Rhode Island, as well as the Art Students League in New York City, developing the artistic talent for which she would become increasingly known during her career. When Vanderbilt came of age and took control of her trust fund, she cut her mother off entirely,<ref></ref> though they later reconciled.<ref name=meredien /> Her mother died in Los Angeles in 1965.<ref name=meredien></ref>
==Career==

Her jeans were more tightly fitted than other jeans of that time and were an immediate success with customers.<ref name=":0" />
In 1978, Vanderbilt sold the rights to her name to the Murjani Group<ref></ref> and re-launched her own company, GV Ltd, which she had founded in 1976.<ref name=":0" /> With her company, she launched dresses, blouses, sheets, shoes, leather goods, liqueurs, and accessories.<ref name=":0" /> In the period from 1982 to 2002, L'Oreal launched eight fragrances under the brand name Gloria Vanderbilt.<ref></ref> The Jones Group acquired the rights to Gloria Vanderbilt jeans in 2002.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
====Fraud trial====
In the 1980s, Vanderbilt accused her former partners in GV Ltd. and her lawyer of fraud. After a lengthy trial (during which time the lawyer died), Vanderbilt won and was awarded nearly $1.7&nbsp;million, but the money was never recovered, though she was also awarded $300,000 by the New York City Bar Association. Vanderbilt also owed millions of dollars in back taxes, since the lawyer had never paid the IRS, and she was forced to sell her Southampton, New York and Upper East Side homes.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="guardianobit"></ref>

Gloria Laura Vanderbilt (February 20, 1924 – June 17, 2019) was an American artist, author, actress, fashion designer, heiress, and socialite. She was a member of the Vanderbilt family and the mother of CNN television anchor Anderson Cooper.
During the 1930s, she was the subject of a high-profile child custody trial in which her mother, Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, and her paternal aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, each sought custody of her and control over her trust fund. Called the "trial of the century" by the press, the court proceedings were the subject of wide and sensational press coverage due to the wealth and prominence of the involved parties, and the scandalous evidence presented to support Whitney's claim that Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt was an unfit parent.<ref></ref>
As an adult in the 1970s, Vanderbilt launched a line of fashions, perfumes, and household goods bearing her name. She was particularly noted as an early developer of designer jeans.
