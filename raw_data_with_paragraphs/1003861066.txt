Jean Lesage

==Early years==
Lesage was born on June 10, 1912, in Montreal, Quebec, one of six children of Xavéri Lesage, a district manager of the insurance company Les Prévoyants du Canada, and Cécile Côté.<ref>Thompson, Dale C. (1984) Jean Lesage and the Quiet Revolution. Macmillan of Canada.</ref>
Lesage began his education at the kindergarten Saint-Enfant-Jésus Montréal. In 1921, the family relocated to Quebec City, where Xavéri Lesage was appointed as assistant manager by his brother Antoni in the headquarters office.<ref>Thompson, Dale C. (1984) Jean Lesage and the Quiet Revolution. Macmillan of Canada.</ref>
==Education==
Lesage enrolled as a day student in the private boarding school École Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague and, in 1923, he was admitted to the Petit Séminaire de Québec for an eight-year program which eventually led to the baccalaureate. He was a talented and bright student who ranked highly in courses, especially in religion, French, Latin, Greek and philosophy.<ref>Thompson, Dale C. (1984) Jean Lesage and the Quiet Revolution. Macmillan of Canada.</ref>
He enrolled in the Faculté de droit de l'Université Laval, where his natural quick wit, his facility in expressing himself, and his argumentative nature assured him success in the field of law. During his years as a student, Lesage was an active Liberal, and he became interested in having a political career. He graduated with a law degree in 1934.<ref>Thompson, Dale C. (1984) Jean Lesage and the Quiet Revolution. Macmillan of Canada.</ref>
In 1965, he received an honorary doctorate from Sir George Williams University, which later became Concordia University.<ref></ref>
==Legal career==
He practised law in Quebec City with Paul Lesage in 1934, then with Charles Gavan Power, Valmore Bienvenue, Paul Lesage, and Jean Turgeon. He married Corinne Lagarde, a singer and the daughter of Alexandre Lagarde and Valéria Matte.
He was made a Crown attorney for the Wartime Prices and Trade Board from 1939 to 1944.
==Federal political career==
Lesage was elected as a federal Member of Parliament for the riding of Montmagny-L'Islet as a Liberal for the first time in the 1945 general election. After his re-election in 1949, he was first named Parliamentary Assistant to the Secretary of State for External Affairs from 25 January 1951 to 31 December 1952. He was then named Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister of Finance from 1 January 1953 to 13 June 1953.
Following his re-election in 1953, Lesage was appointed as Minister of Resources and Development from 17 September 1953 to 15 December 1953, and then Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources from 16 December 1953 to 21 June 1957.<ref> urltoken Government of Canada.

He survived the Progressive Conservative ascendancy and was re-elected in both 1957 and 1958. However, he resigned from his seat on 13 June 1958 following his election as leader of the Liberal Party of Quebec on 31 May 1958.
==Lesage government==
On June 22, 1960, Lesage's Liberal party won the Quebec general election with 51 of 95 seats and 51 per cent of the popular vote. He was elected to the National Assembly of Quebec with the slogans "l’équipe de tonnerre" – "the terrific team" – and "C'est le temps que ça change" - "It’s time for a change".<ref>(Thompson, 1984:87).</ref> His electoral success ended the Union Nationale and Maurice Duplessis's conservative reign since 1944.<ref>Thompson, Dale C. (1984) Jean Lesage and the Quiet Revolution. Macmillan of Canada.</ref>
Lesage became Premier, President of the Executive Council, and Minister of Finance from 5 July 1960 to 16 June 1966. He was also Minister of Federal-Provincial Affairs from 28 March 1961 to 16 June 1966, and Minister of Revenue from 30 May 1963 to 8 August 1963.
His election ushered in the Quiet Revolution, which was the rapid and drastic change of values, attitudes, and behaviours in Quebec society also characterized by a surge in Quebec nationalism.<ref>Thompson, Dale C. (1984) Jean Lesage and the Quiet Revolution. Macmillan of Canada.</ref> In the previous decade, it had already ended its affiliation with the Liberal Party of Canada.
In 1962, the Liberal Party of Quebec won re-election with a campaign promising the nationalization of hydroelectricity, with the slogan Maîtres chez nous (Masters in Our Own Home).
==Major accomplishments==
The Lesage government’s rule significantly contributed to social, economic and political changes in Quebec society, and strengthened the Québécois identity during the Quiet Revolution. The modernization of Quebec was Lesage’s main nationalism.<ref>Thompson, David C. (1984) Jean Lesage and the Quiet Revolution. Macmillan of Canada.</ref>
During his time as premier, Lesage achieved many great changes in Quebec. Lesage believed that French Canadians could very well develop as a modern people within Canada without losing their identity.<ref>Thompson, David C. (1984) Jean Lesage and the Quiet Revolution. Macmillan of Canada.</ref>
One of the major and most successful changes made by the Lesage government was the secularization of Quebec from the Catholic Church. Education reform was one of the most prominent examples of this secularization. Lesage rejected the role of the Catholic Church, which had previously controlled the school system, and modernized it. He wanted the Quebec provincial government to provide education for everyone and instill in them Québécois values as well as produce a better skilled labour force.
The mandatory schooling age was also increased from 14 to 16. The Ministry of Education was created in 1964 with Paul Gérin-Lajoie becoming Quebec’s first Minister of education.<ref>Thompson, David C. (1984). Jean Lesage and the Quiet Revolution. Macmillan of Canada.</ref>
Another major success was the establishment of Hydro-Québec and the nationalization of the province's hydro-electricity. "The nationalization of electricity was 'a logical extension' of the government’s goal of growth. based primarily on the promotion of the French-Canadian people."<ref>(Thompson, 1984:242)</ref>
With much assistance from René Lévesque, the 11 remaining private power companies were bought out, and Hydro-Québec began supplying, distributing, and transmitting the entire province's energy. The Lesage government’s success of Hydro-Québec represents strength, determination, and initiative.
Other major economic accomplishments included the creation of the Société générale de financement to encourage Quebecers to invest in their future and provided capital for private and mainly Francophone enterprises; the creation of public companies like the Société de Montage Automobile (SOMA) to assemble French automobiles in Quebec, the Société Québécoise d’Exploration Minière (SOQUEM) to ensure that mining resources would be developed in the interests of Quebecers and Sidérurgie Québécoise (SIDBEC) which was established as an integrated steel plant.<ref>(Thompson, 1984:212)</ref>
Furthermore, during his time as Premier, Quebec also took over health care from the Church and was the only province to opt out of the national pension plan to create its own version, the Quebec Pension Plan. It also formed the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec to invest in the pension plan funds and the Régie des rentes du Québec to manage the plan, revamped the province’s labour force by giving public-sector workers the right to strike, and laid a foundation for the creation of post-secondary collège d'enseignement général et professionnel (CEGEPs) in the area of education.<ref>Thompson, David C.

===Defeat and retirement===
Despite winning 47% of the vote in the 1966 Quebec general election, compared to 40% for the Union Nationale, Lesage's Liberals won fewer seats because their vote was concentrated in urban ridings. Lesage remained Liberal leader for several years until he resigned in August 1969. He remained Leader of the Opposition until January 1970, when Robert Bourassa became the new Liberal leader. Lesage retired from politics and sat on several corporate boards until his death in 1980.
