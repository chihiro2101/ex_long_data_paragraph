There are a variety of definitions for "grasslands":
* ".any plant community, including harvested forages, in which grasses and/or legumes make up the dominant vegetation."<ref name=":0" /> 
* ".terrestrial ecosystems dominated by herbaceous and shrub vegetation, and maintained by fire, grazing, drought and/or freezing temperatures." (Pilot Assessment of Global Ecosystems, 2000)<ref name=":0" /> 
* "A region with sufficient average annual precipitation (25-75 cm) to support grass." (Stiling, 1999)<ref name=":0" />
Semi-natural grasslands are a very common subcategory of the grasslands biome.<ref></ref> These can be defined as:
* Grassland existing as a result of human activity (mowing or livestock grazing), where environmental conditions and the species pool are maintained by natural processes.<ref></ref>

They can also be described as the following:
* "Semi-natural grasslands are one of the world's most biodiverse habitats on a small spatial scales."<ref name=":1"></ref>
* "Semi-natural grasslands belong to the most species rich ecosystems in the world."<ref name=":3"></ref>
* ".have been formed over the course of pato aventura uuuuu through extensive grazing and mowing."<ref name=":1" />
* ".without the use of pesticides or fertilisers in modern time."<ref name=":2"></ref>
There are many diiferent types types of semi-natural grasslands, e.g. hay meadows.<ref name=":2" />

=== General grassland types ===
==== Tropical and subtropical ====
These grasslands can be classified as the Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands. The rainfall level for that grassland type is between 90-150 centimeters per year. Grasses and scattered trees are common for that ecoregion, as well as large mammals, such as wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) and zebra (Equus zebra). Notable tropical and subtropical grasslands include the Llanos grasslands of South America.<ref></ref>
Grasslands have suffered large losses of organic carbon due to soil disturbances, vegetation degradation, fires, erosion, nutrient deficiencies, and water shortages. The type, frequency and intensity of the disturbance can play a key role in the soil organic carbon (SOC) balance of grasslands. Bedrock, irrigation practices, soil acidification, liming, and pasture management can all have potential impacts on grassland organic carbon stocks.<ref></ref>
Grasslands may occur naturally or as a result of human activity. Hunting cultures around the world often set regular fires to maintain and extend grasslands and prevent fire-intolerant trees and shrubs from taking hold. The tallgrass prairies in the U.S. Midwest may have been extended eastward into Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio by human agency. Much grassland in northwest Europe developed after the Neolithic Period when people gradually cleared the forest to create areas for raising their livestock.<ref></ref>
Land cover has always changed during the years. The following relates to the changes between 1960 and 2015. There has been a decrease in semi-natural grasslands and an increase in areas with arable land, forest and land used for infrastructure and buildings. The line style and relative thickness of the lines indicates the percentage of the total area that changed. Changes less than 1% and land-cover classes with all changes less than 1% (i.e. semi-natural wetlands and water) are not included.<ref name=":5"></ref>
In 1960 most of the land, 49.7%, was covered with forest and there was also more semi-natural grassland (18.8%) than arable land (15.8%). In 2015 this has changed drastically. The forest cover has increased (50.8%) and arable land has also increased (20.4%), but the semi-natural grassland cover has decreased. Although it still covers a large area of the earth (10.6%).<ref name=":5" />
A quarter of semi-natural grassland was lost through intensification, i.e. it was converted into arable or pasture land and forests.<ref></ref> It is more likely that intensification will occur in flat semi-natural grasslands, especially if the soil is fertile. On the other hand, grasslands, where the land is drought-prone or less productive, are more likely to persist as semi-natural grasslands than grasslands with fertile soil and low gradient of the terrain.<ref></ref> Furthermore, the accessibility of the land is also important, as it is then easier to fertilize, for example. For instance, if it is located near a road. With the development of technology, it is becoming increasingly easy to cultivate land with a steeper gradient, to the detriment of grasslands. The management of grasslands is also changing permanently. There is increased use of mineral fertilizers, furthermore borders and field edges are removed to enlarge fields and leveling the terrain to facilitate the use of agricultural machinery.<ref name=":5" />
The professional study of dry grasslands falls under the category of rangeland management, which focuses on ecosystem services associated with the grass-dominated arid and semi-arid rangelands of the world. Rangelands account for an estimated 70% of the earth's landmass; thus, many cultures including those of the United States are indebted to the economics that the world's grasslands have to offer, from producing grazing animals, tourism, ecosystems services such as clean water and air, and energy extraction.<ref></ref>

Grasslands are areas where the vegetation is dominated by grasses (Poaceae). However, sedge (Cyperaceae) and rush (Juncaceae) can also be found along with variable proportions of legumes, like clover, and other herbs. Grasslands occur naturally on all continents except Antarctica and are found in most ecoregions of the Earth. Furthermore, grasslands are one of the largest biomes on earth and dominate the landscape worldwide.<ref name=":0"></ref> They cover 31-43% of the Earth's land area. There are different types of grasslands: natural grasslands, semi-natural grasslands, and agricultural grasslands.<ref name=":0" />
