The official languages of the European Patent Office are English, French and German<ref></ref> and publications including the European Patent Bulletin and Official Journal of the European Patent Office are published in all three of those languages.<ref></ref>
European patent applications may be filed in any language<ref></ref><ref name="A‑X, 9.2.1 Conditions - Guidelines for Examination"> "Conditions"</ref> provided that a translation into one of the official languages is submitted within two months if the language of filing is not an EPO official language.<ref></ref> The official language in which the application is filed or into which it is translated is taken to be the language of the proceedings<ref></ref> and the application is published in that language.<ref></ref> Documentary evidence may also be submitted in any language, although the EPO may require a translation.<ref></ref>
Some Contracting States to the European Patent Convention have an official language which is not an official language of the EPO, such as Dutch, Italian or Spanish. These languages are referred to as "admissible non-EPO languages".<ref name="A‑X, 9.2.1 Conditions - Guidelines for Examination"/> Residents or nationals of such States may submit any documents subject to a time limit in an official language of that State<ref name="EPC Article|14|4"></ref> and there is a period of one month for filing a translation into an official language<ref></ref> or the document is deemed not to have been filed.<ref name="EPC Article|14|4"/> The filing fee and examination fee are reduced by 30% for certain categories of applicants, namely for small and medium-sized enterprises, natural persons, and "non-profit organisations, universities or public research organisations", when filing a patent application or an examination request in an admissible non-EPO language and subsequently, or at the earliest simultaneously, file the necessary translation.<ref name="A‑X, 9.2.1 Conditions - Guidelines for Examination"/><ref>, , and urltoken RFees 14(1)</ref>
== Departments and directorates-general==
Image:The new European Patent Office in Rijswijk.jpg|thumb|right|Branch of the EPO at The Hague, Netherlands<ref>Under .</ref> (more precisely at Rijswijk, a suburb of The Hague).
The European Patent Office includes the following departments to carry out the procedures laid down in the EPC:<ref></ref>
* a Receiving Section, responsible for the examination on filing and the examination as to formal requirements of European patent applications;<ref> and </ref>
* Search Divisions, "responsible for drawing up European search reports";<ref> and </ref>
* Examining Divisions, responsible for prior art searches and the examination of European patent applications;<ref> and </ref>
* Opposition Divisions, responsible for the examination of oppositions against any European patent;<ref> and </ref>
* a Legal Division, "responsible for decisions in respect of entries in the Register of European Patents and in respect of registration on, and deletion from, the list of professional representatives";<ref> and </ref>
* Boards of Appeal, "responsible for the examination of appeals from decisions of the Receiving Section, the Examining Divisions and Opposition Divisions, and the Legal Division";<ref> and </ref> and
* an Enlarged Board of Appeal to notably ensure uniform application of patent law.<ref> and </ref>
The above departments of European Patent Office are organized into three "Directorates-General" (DG), each being directed by a Vice-President, the DG Patent Granting Process, the DG Corporate Services, and the DG Legal and International Affairs, and a Boards of Appeal Unit, acting as the EPO’s judiciary.<ref name="Structure of the European Patent Office"></ref> According to Sir Robin Jacob, the members of the EPO Boards of Appeal are "judges in all but name".<ref>Sir Robin Jacob, National Courts and the EPO Litigation System, GRUR Int. 2008, Vol. 8-9, pages 658-662, referring to what he said in Lenzing's Appn. 1997 RPC 245 at p. 277 and repeated in Unilin v. Berry 2007 EWCA Civ. 364.</ref>
The European Patent Office does not make decisions on infringement matters. National courts have jurisdiction over Enforcement of European patents. Regarding the validity of European patents however, both the European Patent Office during opposition proceedings and national courts during nullity proceedings may decide to revoke a European patent.
== Activities under the Patent Cooperation Treaty ==
In the international procedure according to the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), the European Patent Office acts as a Receiving Office, an International Searching Authority (ISA), an International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) and, with effect from 1 July 2010, as a so-called Supplementary International Searching Authority (SISA).<ref> urltoken PCT Newsletter No. 04/2010, page 1, "European Patent Office to Offer Supplementary International Search", and page 7, "Notification under PCT Rule 90.4(d) and 90.5(c) (European Patent Office)" (". to include its capacity as Supplementary International Searching Authority (SISA).")</ref> The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) provides an international procedure for handling patent applications, called international applications, during the first 30 months after their first filing in any country party to the PCT. The European Patent Office does not grant "international patents," as such patents do not exist. After 30 months (or, for a few countries, after 20 months)<ref>As of October 2009, three countries: Luxembourg, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, see urltoken PCT Reservations, Declarations, Notifications and Incompatibilities (status on 29 September 2009) (PCT Articles, 22(1)) and (See "Editor's Note").</ref> an international application must be converted into national or regional patent applications, and then are subject to national/regional grant procedures.
As Supplementary International Searching Authority (SISA), the European Patent Office has announced that it will conduct no more than 700 supplementary international searches per year.<ref> urltoken PCT Applicant’s Guide – International Phase – Annex SISA, SISA International Searching Authorities (Supplementary Search) EP European Patent Office (EPO), 3 June 2010, page 2. Consulted on June 6, 2010.</ref>
== Online services ==
The EPO offers on its web site several free services, including Espacenet and Open Patent Services (OPS) for searching within its collection of patent documents, the legal texts published in its Official Journal, the European Patent Register containing legal information relating to published European patent applications and European patents<ref></ref> (the European Patent Register also allowing the inspection of files under , and a publication server of the European patent applications and patents. There is also the CMS software for filing European patent applications online.
== International cooperation ==
The EPO engages in several forms of international co-operation within and outside of Europe, with other intellectual property offices, as well as with international organisations that are outside of the patent system.<ref>: urltoken The EPO cooperates with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the Japan Patent Office (JPO) as one of the Trilateral Patent Offices. It also works with the Japan Patent Office (JPO), the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO), China's National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in a co-operation known as the "five IP offices" or IP5.<ref>See urltoken Five IP offices website.</ref>
On 27 April 2017, the EPO and the Eurasian Patent Organization (EAPO) signed a program enabling increased work-sharing and accelerated treatment of patent applications between both patent offices. The agreement, known as the Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH), was signed by the presidents of the EPO and EAPO in Munich. The EAPO president Saule Tlevlessova stated, "The signing of this bilateral PPH agreement opens a new page in the history of EAPO-EPO co-operation, and will serve to benefit applicants and our offices."<ref></ref>
Currently, the EPO offers three types of cooperation agreements with non-member states<ref> urltoken :
* Technical co-operation aims to align national or regional patent systems in emerging economies with the European patent system. It enables partners to access the EPO's tools or participate in pilot programmes such as the Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH) which offers a fast-track procedure. 
* Reinforced partnerships build on technical co-operation and develop strategic ties in technical areas of mutual interest. Partner offices can avoid duplication of work through the re-use of EPO results.
* In the validation system, inventors and businesses filing for a European patent can extend the scope of protection to a validation state. This scheme enables long-term technical cooperation that can be customised according to partner requirements.
== Employees' representation and labour relations ==
The main staff union active within the EPO is the "Staff Union of the European Patent Office" (SUEPO).<ref name=lemonde-2015> - English, German and Dutch translations of "Un si bon office": urltoken "Such a good office"</ref>
As an international organization, EPOorg enjoys immunity and national courts have -in principle- no jurisdiction regarding disputes in which EPO is a party. Labour disputes can be submitted by employees to the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization (ILOAT).<ref></ref> Courts in the Netherlands have however on occasion taken jurisdiction when it found a breach of fundamental principles of human rights, based on European Court of Human Rights case law. Jurisdiction was assumed for example because the ILOAT procedure (of over 3 years) was too lengthy for a process involving health issues<ref></ref> or regarding a conflict with labour unions, as no appeal to ILOAT or any other judicial organization was possible.<ref>Judgment: - Unofficial English translation by SUEPO: urltoken "Case No. 200.141.812-01"</ref> The background to the latter judgment was the ongoing conflict between EPO staff and management, in particular the refusal of EPO to recognise the staff unions, blocking of e-mail communication between the unions and their members and restriction of the right to strike.<ref name="volkskrant-02-2015"> - English, French and German translations of "Opstelten: Uitspraak rechter geldt niet voor europese instelling": urltoken "Opstelten: Court ruling does not apply to European institution"</ref> Opstelten's intervention was criticised by a number of Dutch legal experts including Cedric Ryngaert, Professor of International Law in Utrecht, who considered the Minister's intervention to be unusual: "Basically he erodes the power of the Court. International organisations are going to increasingly put themselves above the law, which is already a problem now. Opstelten relies on an Act from the seventies, which must be applied dynamically. Instead he takes a very conservative view."<ref name="volkskrant-02-2015"/>
Labour relations at the EPO during the presidency of Benoît Battistelli have been strained and marked by conflict with a noticeable escalation during 2014.<ref> urltoken "Streit beim Europäischen Patentamt eskaliert", Süddeutsche Zeitung, 11.03.2014</ref><ref> urltoken "European Patent Office Staff Calls Strike; President Battistelli Reacts", Intellectual Property Watch, 19.03.2014</ref><ref> urltoken "EPO facing more strike action", World Intellectual Property Review, 28.05.2014</ref><ref> urltoken "EPO staff in Battistelli fight" ", World Intellectual Property Review, 28.05.2014</ref> Staff discontent has been attributed to Battistelli's style of management which, according to reports in the German newspapers Die Zeit and Die Welt, was perceived by staff as being unduly autocratic and unsuited to a European intergovernmental body such as the EPO.<ref> urltoken "Umstritten und souverän", Die Zeit, 30.03.2014</ref><ref>English translation of "Umstritten und souverän": urltoken "Controversial and sovereign" </ref><ref></ref>
Concern has been expressed regarding the high number of suicides of EPO employees, five in over three years.<ref name=lemonde-2015/><ref> - English, French and Dutch translations of "Burgfrieden in der Steueroase Europaeisches Patentamt": urltoken "Truce in the tax haven of the EPO"</ref> The EPO President Battistelli dismissed the suggestions -by EPO staff union SUEPO- of a possible link between the suicide and working conditions at the EPO as "totally inappropriate" and accused the staff union of "abusing a personal tragedy and inciting controversy". The EPO staff union SUEPO said that a direct link between the suicide and the working conditions had not been demonstrated but that the Dutch Labour Inspectorate should be given the opportunity of investigating the matter.<ref> - English, French and Dutch translations of "Alarm om schrikbewind bij Europees patentbureau na vijfde zelfmoord": urltoken "Alarm about reign of terror at the European Patent Office after fifth suicide"</ref>
==Controversial investment fund==
In June 2018, the German Federal Court of Auditors and financial experts criticized the planned establishment by the EPO of a fund, called "EPO Treasury Investment Fund" (EPOTIF), to manage 2.3 billion euros of its assets, the fund including risky financial products such as asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, and credit default swaps.<ref> (also available urltoken here)</ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>

The European Patent Office is directed by a president, who is responsible for its activities to the Administrative Council.<ref></ref> The president also represents the European Patent Organisation.<ref></ref> The president has therefore a dual role: representative of the European Patent Organisation and head of the European Patent Office.<ref>Decision urltoken T 1012/03 of December 1, 2006, Reasons 35.</ref> The President of the European Patent Office is appointed by the Administrative Council.<ref></ref> A majority of three-quarters of the votes of the Contracting States represented and voting in the Administrative Council is required for the appointment of the President.<ref>, which refers to "Article 11, paragraph 1".</ref><ref>See for instance: EPO web site, urltoken Decision on next EPO President deferred , News, 30 October 2009. Consulted on 31 October 2009.</ref>
The President is assisted by a collective body known as the Management Advisory Committee (MAC). Currently, the MAC comprises the President, three Vice-Presidents and several Principal Directors and Directors. Each MAC member is responsible for a specific business area and reports to the President. The MAC is expected to implement initiatives in alignment with general policy and propose initiatives or policy changes that could impact the activities of the EPO.<ref> urltoken 
More generally, the "management of the EPO is dominated by the delegates of the contracting States in the Administrative Council," these delegates being, according to Otto Bossung, primarily guided by their national interests rather than by supranational interests such as for instance the implementation of the EU internal market.<ref></ref>
