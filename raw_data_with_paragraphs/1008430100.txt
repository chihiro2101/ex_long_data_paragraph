Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility/Alternative text for images

==Audience==
The audience for alternative text includes:
*Readers with visual impairment of varying degrees who browse Wikipedia using a screen reader that translates text into speech or Braille, such as JAWS, NVDA or Orca<ref name=WebAIM />
*Readers using browsers that do not support images (e.g., Lynx), or that are configured not to display them (e.g. Wikipedia Zero);<ref name=WebAIM />
*Search-engine bots.<ref name=WebAIM />
Experiencing Wikipedia with a screen reader requires practice. An experienced screen-reader user may choose to skip portions of the text.
==How to write alternative text==
===Basics===
Alternative text should be short, such as "A basketball player" or "Tony Blair shakes hands with George W. Bush". If it needs to be longer, the important details should appear in the first few words, allowing the user of a screen reader to skip forward once the key points are understood. Very long descriptions can be left for the body of the article.<ref name=G94/> MediaWiki does not support HTML's longdesc attribute. All readers will be aware this element is an image, so adding "photograph of" isn't usually necessary.
The <code>alt</code> text should consist of plain text (no HTML or wiki markup such as wikilinks) and without line breaks. The text must comply with Neutral point of view, Verifiability, No original research, and Biographies of living persons. Since it cannot contain inline citations, it must not convey any contentious point, or material not obvious to any reader. The <code>alt</code> text is read out by screen readers just before the caption, so avoid having the same details in both.
===Importance of context===
Understanding the context of an image is vital. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 recommend editors consider four questions:<ref name=UnderstandingSC111/>
* Why is this non-text content here?
* What information is it presenting?
* What purpose does it fulfil?
* If I could not use the non-text content, what words would I use to convey the same function or information?
For example, an image of Napoleon Bonaparte could be used in
* an article on great military leaders where it illustrates an example of such a leader—the alternative text should name the subject;
* an Napoleon I illustrating what he looked like—the alternative text should briefly describe his appearance if it matters to the article;
* an article on a painting of him—the alternative text should briefly describe the painting.
===Images that contain words===
If an image contains words important to the reader's understanding, the alternative text should contain those words.<ref name="G94" /> If it contains non-Latin characters, consider providing a transliteration. Screen readers without Unicode support will read a character outside Latin-1 as a question mark, and even in the latest version of JAWS, the most popular screen reader, Unicode characters are very difficult to read.
===Captions and nearby text===
:For details of the wiki markup that produces these elements, see Wikipedia:Extended image syntax#Alt text and caption.
Images are typically thumbnails with captions. The caption is visible to all readers, and can contain HTML markup, wikilinks and inline citations. An infobox often contains a plain image with the caption as a separate row. A good caption should succinctly identify the subject of the image and establish the image's relevance to the article, without detailing the obvious.
Where the caption is sufficiently descriptive or evocative of the image, or where it makes clear what the function of the image is, one option is to write . Where nearby text in the article performs the same function, it can be .<ref name=nearbytext/>
===Maps and diagrams===
With maps, diagrams and charts, the colour, position, and size of elements are not important. Instead, concentrate on the information being presented. For example, a chart may have alternative text "Sales in June exceeded those in July, and August's were higher still", and a diagrammatic animation may have alternative text "Animation of a car engine in motion". The structural formula of a chemical compound can be unambiguously described using IUPAC nomenclature and the drug or chemistry infoboxes include this information.
===<span id="Blank alt attributes"></span><span id="Purely decorative images"></span><span id="BLANKALT"></span><span id="PDI"></span> Decorative images===
An image that provides no essential information is a purely decorative image. A decorative image may provide visual structure or aesthetic flourish, but can cause confusion outside that visual context. A non-blank alt attribute on a decorative image results in audible clutter for screen reader users, and irrelevant text inserted into search engine results.
Similar problems exist for an image that strictly repeats the information found in nearby text or in a caption. The nearby text is sufficient as the image's alternative text. A non-blank alt attribute results in repetitive text for screen readers and search engines.
In both cases, a blank alt attribute is ideal.
* For public domain, CC0, or similarly licensed images, unlink the image and use a blank alt attribute: . The combination of no link and a blank alt attribute causes screen readers to skip the image, and causes search engines to skip the image in search result text snippets.
* For CC-BY-SA, GFDL, or similarly licensed images, a blank alt attribute should not be used. It is Wikipedia's policy to link those images for attribution, and linked images must have a non-blank alt attribute to prevent empty links, which result in confusing announcements in screen readers. When a blank alt attribute is desired, consider replacing CC-BY-SA images with public domain equivalents. Otherwise, use a brief alt attribute (such as , , , or to minimize the confusing text.
Icons that convey information not found in the text should have alt attributes that describe their function, not their appearance. For example, an arrow icon used to navigate to the following page should have an alt attribute of not . If the arrow were accompanied by a descriptive text link with same function, a blank alt attribute would be more appropriate.<ref name=WebAIM />
==Alt text in templates and galleries==
;Templates: Many templates such as and have their own parameters for specifying <code>alt</code> text. If a template lacks such a parameter, consider asking that it be added.
;Galleries: The Wikipedia:Gallery tag supports <code>alt</code> text since MediaWiki 1.18.<ref>bugzilla:18682</ref> and also support it. For an example on using the Help:Table to create a gallery see Galleries.
;Timelines: The :mw:Extension:EasyTimeline/syntax generates an image with no <code>alt</code> text. When using tables instead, add a table summary, which is read out by screen readers to give an overview of the contents.
;Math formulae: The Help:Displaying a formula is used to generate math formulae. These may be rendered as an image or using text, depending on their complexity and user preferences. For simple formulae, use the <code>alt</code> parameter to translate it to English. More complex formulae are hard to specify and the original markup may be the best option, which is the default if no <code>alt</code> parameter is supplied.
==Links and attribution==
Writing "" will cause the MediaWiki software to render HTML with an empty <code>alt</code> attribute in the <code>img</code> tag. When the image is a link, screen readers will read out the link filename (e.g., "slash green underscore tick") if the HTML <code>alt</code> attribute is empty or missing. Nearly all images in Wikipedia articles are links to the image description page, which contains a larger size version of the image, as well as licensing and attribution information.<ref name=LinkBlankAlt group=Note/>
Wikipedia articles sometimes contain images that do not link to an image page, for example an Information icon. Such images should be configured so they are ignored by screen readers. This is achieved by adding to the image wiki markup. Removing the link is acceptable for images in the public domain or the equivalent CC0. Links should not be suppressed for any image that requires attribution.
Most images in Wikipedia articles do not serve an active function; they are not buttons or menu options. Where the image serves as a link to another article, name the article in the alternative text. Where following the link performs an operation (such as sort), indicate the operation. Do not say "click here" or "link to" as the reader will already know the image is a link and may not be clicking a mouse button on it.<ref name=Petrie2005>Petrie, Helen; Harrison, Chandra; and Dev, Sundeep. urltoken Describing images on the Web: a survey of current practice and prospects for the future, Centre for Human Computer Interaction Design, City University London, accessed June 8, 2010.</ref>

Alternative text is text associated with an image that serves the same purpose and conveys the same essential information as the image.<ref name=G94/> In situations where the image is not available to the reader, perhaps because they have turned off images in their web browser or are using a screen reader due to a visual impairment, the alternative text ensures that no information or functionality is lost.<ref name=G94/> Absent or unhelpful alternative text can be a source of frustration for visually impaired users.<ref name=Lazar2007/>
On Wikipedia, alternative text is typically supplied through a combination of the image caption and the text supplied for the image <code>alt</code> parameter in the MediaWiki markup. The following example produces the adjacent image:
<blockquote><code><nowiki></nowiki></code></blockquote>
The <code>alt</code> parameter text ("Painting of Napoleon Bonaparte in His Study at the Tuileries") is not normally visible to readers; however, it may be displayed by web browsers when images are switched off, or read out loud by screen readers for those with visual impairment, and can be used by search engines to determine the content of the image.<ref name=WebAIM /> In keeping with other Internet guidelines, the term "<code>alt</code> text" (in a <code>code</code> font) is used here to refer to the text supplied for the image <code>alt</code> parameter and which generates text for the alt attribute; the term "alternative text" refers to the text equivalent for an image, regardless of where that text resides.<ref name=nearbytext> urltoken G74: Providing a long description in text near the non-text content, with a reference to the location of the long description in the short description, WCAG 2.0 technique.<br/>WebAim writes: "The alt attribute (sometimes called the alt tag, though technically this is incorrect) is not the only mechanism for providing the content and function of the image. This information can also be provided in text adjacent to the image or within the page containing the image. . The term alternative text, as used in this article, refers to the text equivalent for an image, regardless of where that text resides. It does not refer solely to the alt attribute of the image tag. See WebAIM. urltoken Alternative Text Basics, accessed 30 September 2020.</ref>
For images that link to their image description page (which is nearly all images on Wikipedia), the <code>alt</code> text cannot be blank nor should the <code>alt</code> parameter be absent. This is because a screen reader, in order to describe the purpose of the link, will default to reading out the image filename when no <code>alt</code> text is available.<ref>W3C. urltoken F89: Failure (.) due to using null alt on an image where the image is the only content in a link, Techniques for WCAG 2.0, accessed November 5, 2014</ref> This is usually not helpful. In the above Napoleon example, the screen reader would have read out "link graphic slash Jacques hyphen Louis underscore David underscore zero one seven" had we not supplied the <code>alt</code> parameter.<ref>WebAIM says: "An image that is the only thing inside a link must never have a missing or null <code>alt</code> attribute. This is because the screen reader must read SOMETHING to identify the link." See WebAIM, urltoken Context is Everything, accessed 30 September 2020.</ref>
An image that is purely decorative (provides no information and serves only an aesthetic purpose) requires no alternative text. Often the caption fully meets the requirements for alternative text. However, the only situation where blank <code>alt</code> text is acceptable is where such images are unlinked, which is rarely possible. One solution is to provide something at least minimally useful such as , , or . Another solution, if a caption doesn't already describe or identify the image, is for the <code>alt</code> text to do so as briefly as possible.
