Alberto Sordi

==Early life==
Born in Rome to a schoolteacher and a musician and the last of five children, he was named in honour of an older sibling, who died several days after his birth. Sordi enrolled in Milan's dramatic arts academy but was kicked out because of his thick Roman accent. In the meantime he studied to be a bass opera singer. His vocal distinctiveness would become his trademark.<ref></ref>
==Career==
===Cinema and television===
In a career that spanned seven decades, Sordi<ref></ref> established himself as an icon<ref></ref> of Italian cinema with his representative skills at both comedy and light drama. His movie career began in the late 1930s with bit parts and secondary characters in wartime movies. Early roles included Fellini's The White Sheik in 1952, Fellini's I vitelloni (1953), a movie about young slackers, in which he plays a weak, effeminate immature loafer and a starring role in The Bachelor as a single man trying to find love. Sordi frequently appeared in Italian historical comedies.<ref></ref>
In 1959, he appeared in Monicelli's Great War, considered by many critics and film historians to be one of the best Italian comedies. The Hollywood Foreign Press recognized his abilities when he was awarded a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Actor in a Musical or Comedy for To Bed or Not to Bed (1963). Sordi acted alongside Britain's David Niven in the World War II comedy The Best of Enemies. In 1965, he was in another highly regarded comedy, I complessi (Complexes).
In 1969, he was a juror at the 6th Moscow International Film Festival.<ref name="Moscow1969"></ref> In 1984, he directed and co-scripted Tutti dentro (Off to jail, everybody), in which he played a judge who has warrants for corruption served on ministers and businessmen.<ref></ref> In 1985, he was a member of the jury at the 35th Berlin International Film Festival.<ref name="Berlinale 1985"></ref>
===Dubbing===
Sordi was also a prominent voice actor and dubber.<ref> urltoken Cronologia fondamentale dell'epoca d'oro del doppiaggio italiano Dagli albori agli anni 1970 (in Italian)</ref> Prior to the war he began working as a dubber for the Italian versions of many Laurel and Hardy shorts and movies, voicing Oliver Hardy after winning an MGM contest for the Italian voice nearest to that of Oliver Hardy.<ref> urltoken Sordi provided the voice of Hardy in more than forty Laurel and Hardy films from 1939 to 1951, paired with Mauro Zambuto, who voiced Stan Laurel. He also appeared as a voice actor in other Italian-language versions and Italian films.<ref></ref>
Sordi provided voice-overs for such actors as Bruce Bennett, Anthony Quinn, John Ireland, Robert Mitchum, Pedro Armendáriz and Frank Faylen. He also dubbed Italian actors such as Franco Fabrizi, Marcello Mastroianni and Enzo Fiermonte for English-speaking audiences. His own voice was dubbed over by Gualtiero De Angelis in Cuori nella tormenta and Carlo Romano in Bullet for Stefano. Sordi ceased his career as a dubber in 1956.
==Personal life==
Sordi was discreet about his private life. Despite never marrying or having children, Sordi has been in several relationships, including a nine-year lasting romance with actress Andreina Pagnani, who was almost 14 years his senior.<ref></ref>
Sordi was raised Roman Catholic.
Sordi was also a big supporter of AS Roma football team. This was something he expressed a fondness of in some of his films.
==Awards==
Sordi won seven David di Donatello, Italy's most prestigious film award, holding the record of David di Donatello as best actor, and four awards for his works from the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists. He also received a Golden Lion for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival in 1995, and Golden Globe Award<ref></ref> for his performance as an Italian labourer stranded in Sweden in To Bed or Not to Bed. In 2000, the City of Rome made him honorary mayor for a day to celebrate his eightieth birthday.
At the 22nd Berlin International Film Festival, he won the Silver Bear for Best Actor award for In Prison Awaiting Trial.<ref name="berlinale 1972"></ref> At the 13th Moscow International Film Festival he won a Special Prize for I Know That You Know That I Know.<ref name="Moscow1983"></ref>
Sordi received honorary citizenship from Kansas City, Missouri for his references to the city in the 1954 film, Un americano a Roma.<ref> urltoken Biography of Alberto Sordi. See "1951–1960" </ref><ref> urltoken Alberto Sordi on Roma Virtuale website; accessed 14 July 2020.</ref>
==Illness and death==
In 2001, Sordi was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died of pneumonia and bronchitis at his house in Rome on 24 February 2003. A crowd in excess of a million gathered to pay their last respects at his funeral by the Basilica of St. John Lateran.<ref> urltoken La Repubblica/spettacoli_e_cultura: Per Albertone 250mila in piazza San Giovanni</ref>
