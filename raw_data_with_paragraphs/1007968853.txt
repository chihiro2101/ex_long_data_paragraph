Turkey vulture

== Taxonomy ==
The turkey vulture received its common name from the resemblance of the adult's bald red head and its dark plumage to that of the male wild turkey, while the name "vulture" is derived from the Latin word vulturus, meaning "tearer", and is a reference to its feeding habits.<ref name="Holloway"></ref> The word buzzard is used by North Americans to refer to this bird, yet in the Old World that term refers to members of the genus Buteo.<ref></ref> The turkey vulture was first formally described by Carl Linnaeus as Vultur aura in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae, and characterised as "V. fuscogriseus, remigibus nigris, rostro albo" ("brown-gray vulture, with black wing flight feathers and a white beak").<ref></ref> It is a member of the family Cathartidae, along with the other six species of New World vultures, and included in the genus Cathartes, along with the greater yellow-headed vulture and the lesser yellow-headed vulture. Like other New World vultures, the turkey vulture has a diploid chromosome number of 80.<ref></ref>
The taxonomic placement of the turkey vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures has been in flux.<ref name="SACC">

</ref> Though both are similar in appearance and have similar Ecological niche, the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world.

However, recent genetic studies indicate that neither New World nor Old World vultures are close to falcons, nor are New World vultures close to storks.<ref name = "Hackett2008"></ref> Both are basal members of the clade Afroaves,<ref name = "Jarvis2014"/> with Old World vultures comprising several groups within the family Accipitridae, also containing eagles, kites, and hawks,<ref name="Lerner2005"></ref><ref name = "Griffiths2007"/> while New World vultures in Cathartiformes are a sister group to Accipitriformes<ref name = "Jarvis2014"></ref> (containing the osprey and secretarybird along with Accipitridae<ref name = "Griffiths2007"></ref>).
There are five subspecies of turkey vulture:
* C. a. aura is the nominate subspecies. It is found from Mexico south through South America and the Greater Antilles. This subspecies occasionally overlaps its range with other subspecies. It is the smallest of the subspecies, but is nearly indistinguishable from C. a. meridionalis in color.<ref name="Amadon"/>
* C. a. jota, the Chilean turkey vulture, is larger, browner, and slightly paler than C. a. ruficollis. The secondary feathers and wing coverts may have gray margins.<ref name="Blake"></ref>
* C. a. meridionalis, the western turkey vulture, is a synonym for C. a. teter. C. a. teter was identified as a subspecies by Friedman in 1933, but in 1964 Alexander Wetmore separated the western birds, which took the name meridionalis, which was applied earlier to a migrant from South America. It breeds from southern Manitoba, southern British Columbia, central Alberta and Saskatchewan south to Baja California, south-central Arizona, southeastern New Mexico, and south-central Texas.<ref></ref> It is the most migratory subspecies, migrating as far as South America, where it overlaps the range of the smaller C. a. aura. It differs from the eastern turkey vulture in color, as the edges of the lesser wing coverts are darker brown and narrower.<ref name="Amadon"/>
* C. a. ruficollis, the tropical turkey vulture, is found in Panama south through Uruguay and Argentina. It is also found on the island of Trinidad.<ref name="Brown"/> It is darker and more black than C. a. aura, with brown wing edgings which are narrower or absent altogether.<ref name="Brown"></ref> The head and neck are dull red with yellow-white or green-white markings. Adults generally have a pale yellow patch on the crown of the head.<ref name="Blake"/>
* C. a. septentrionalis is known as the eastern turkey vulture. The eastern and western turkey vultures differ in tail and wing proportions. It ranges from southeastern Canada south through the eastern United States. It is less migratory than C. a. meridionalis and rarely migrates to areas south of the United States.<ref name="Amadon"></ref>

Houghton Mifflin (2001). </ref><ref name = "CRC">CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, 2nd Edition (2008). John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press. .</ref> It displays minimal sexual dimorphism; sexes are identical in plumage and in coloration, and are similar in size.<ref></ref> The body feathers are mostly brownish-black, but the flight feathers on the wings appear to be silvery-gray beneath, contrasting with the darker wing linings.<ref name="Hilty"/> The adult's head is small in proportion to its body and is red in color with few to no feathers. It also has a relatively short, hooked, ivory-colored beak.<ref name="Terres"></ref> The irises of the eyes are gray-brown; legs and feet are pink-skinned, although typically stained white. The eye has a single incomplete row of eyelashes on the upper lid and two rows on the lower lid.<ref name=" Pterylosis "></ref>
The two front toes of the foot are long and have small webs at their bases.<ref name="Feduccia"/> Tracks are large, between in length and in width, both measurements including claw marks. Toes are arranged in the classic, anisodactyl pattern.<ref name="Elbroch"></ref> The feet are flat, relatively weak, and poorly adapted to grasping; the talons are also not designed for grasping, as they are relatively blunt.<ref name="Concise"/> In flight, the tail is long and slim. The black vulture is relatively shorter-tailed and shorter-winged, which makes it appear rather smaller in flight than the turkey vulture, although the body masses of the two species are roughly the same. The nostrils are not divided by a septum, but rather are perforate; from the side one can see through the beak.<ref></ref> It undergoes a molt in late winter to early spring. It is a gradual molt, which lasts until early autumn.<ref name="Fergus"/> The immature bird has a gray head with a black beak tip; the colors change to those of the adult as the bird matures.<ref></ref> Captive longevity is not well known. there are two captive birds over 45 years old: the Gabbert Raptor Center on the University of Minnesota campus is home to a turkey vulture named Nero with a confirmed hatch year of 1974,<ref name="Turkey Vulture: Nero"></ref> and another male bird, named Lord Richard, lives at the Lindsay Wildlife Experience in Walnut Creek, CA. Lord Richard hatched in 1974 and arrived at the museum later that year.<ref></ref> The oldest wild captured banded bird was 16 years old.<ref name="ADW"/>
Leucistic (sometimes mistakenly called "albino") turkey vultures are sometimes seen.<ref></ref><ref>Golden Gate Raptor Observatory. urltoken Rare Raptors. Retrieved 2007-09-17.</ref>
The turkey vulture, like most other vultures, has very few vocalization capabilities. Because it lacks a syrinx, it can only utter hisses and grunts.<ref name="Miskimen"/> It usually hisses when it feels threatened, or when fighting with other vultures over a carcass. Grunts are commonly heard from hungry young and from adults in their courtship display.
== Distribution and habitat ==
The turkey vulture has a large range, with an estimated global occurrence of . It is the most abundant vulture in the Americas.<ref name="Concise"/> Its global population is estimated to be 4,500,000 individuals.<ref name=IUCN/> It is found in open and semi-open areas throughout the Americas from southern Canada to Cape Horn. It is a permanent resident in the southern United States, though northern birds may migrate as far south as South America.<ref name="ADW"></ref> The turkey vulture is widespread over open country, subtropical forests, shrublands, deserts, and foothills.<ref name="Kaufman"/> It is also found in pastures, grasslands, and wetlands.<ref name=IUCN/> It is most commonly found in relatively open areas which provide nearby woods for nesting and it generally avoids heavily forested areas.<ref name="Hilty"/>
This bird with its crow-like aspect gave foot to the naming of the Quebrada de los Cuervos (Crows Ravine) in Uruguay, where they dwell together with the lesser yellow-headed vulture and the black vulture.<ref>

== Ecology and behavior ==
The turkey vulture is gregarious and roosts in large community groups, breaking away to forage independently during the day. Several hundred vultures may roost communally in groups, which sometimes even include black vultures. It roosts on dead, leafless trees, and will also roost on man-made structures such as water or microwave towers. Though it nests in caves, it does not enter them except during the breeding season.<ref name="Fergus"/> The turkey vulture lowers its night-time body temperature by about 6 degrees Celsius to , becoming slightly hypothermia.<ref name="Feduccia"></ref>
This vulture is often seen standing in a spread-winged or heraldic stance. The stance is believed to serve multiple functions: drying the wings, warming the body, and baking off bacteria. It is practiced more often following damp or rainy nights. This same behavior is displayed by other New World vultures, by Old World vultures, and by storks.<ref name="snyder"/> Like storks, the turkey vulture often defecates on its own legs, using the evaporation of the water in the feces and/or urine to cool itself, a process known as urohidrosis.<ref></ref> It cools the blood vessels in the unfeathered tarsi and feet, and causes white uric acid to streak the legs.<ref></ref>
The turkey vulture has few natural predators. Adult, immature and fledging vultures may fall prey to great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, golden eagles and bald eagles, while eggs and nestlings may be preyed on by mammals such as raccoons and opossums.<ref name="snyder"/><ref name="animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu"/><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> Foxes can occasionally ambush an adult but species that can climb are more likely to breach and predate nests than adults.<ref>Jackson, J. A. (1983). Nesting phenology, nest site selection, and reproductive success of the Black and Turkey vulture. Vulture biology and management. (Wilbur, S. R. and J. A. Jackson, Eds.) Univ. of California Press, Berkeley, CA. pp.245-270.</ref> Its primary form of defense is regurgitating semi-digested meat, a foul-smelling substance, which deters most creatures intent on raiding a vulture nest.<ref name="Fergus"></ref> It will also sting if the predator is close enough to get the vomit in its face or eyes. In some cases, the vulture must rid its crop of a heavy, undigested meal to take flight to flee from a potential predator.<ref name="Terres"/> Its life expectancy in the wild ranges upward of 16 years, with a captive life span of over 45 years being possible.<ref></ref><ref> urltoken Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura). raptorrehab.org</ref><ref name="Turkey Vulture: Nero"/>
The turkey vulture is awkward on the ground with an ungainly, hopping walk. It requires a great deal of effort to take flight, flapping its wings while pushing off the ground and hopping with its feet.<ref name="Terres"/> While soaring, the turkey vulture holds its wings in a shallow V-shape and often tips from side to side, frequently causing the gray flight feathers to appear silvery as they catch the light. The flight of the turkey vulture is an example of static soaring flight, in which it flaps its wings very infrequently, and takes advantage of rising thermals to stay soaring.<ref name="USGS">

=== Breeding ===
The breeding season of the turkey vulture varies according to latitude.<ref></ref> In the southern United States, it commences in March, peaks in April to May, and continues into June.<ref name="Georgia"></ref> In more northerly latitudes, the season starts later and extends into August.<ref></ref> Courtship rituals of the turkey vulture involve several individuals gathering in a circle, where they perform hopping movements around the perimeter of the circle with wings partially spread. In the air, one bird closely follows another while flapping and diving.<ref name="Kaufman"></ref>
Eggs are generally laid in the nesting site in a protected location such as a cliff, a cave, a rock crevice, a burrow, inside a hollow tree, or in a thicket. There is little or no construction of a nest; eggs are laid on a bare surface. Females generally lay two eggs, but sometimes one and rarely three. The eggs are cream-colored, with brown or lavender spots around their larger end.<ref name="Kaufman"/> Both parents incubate, and the young hatch after 30 to 40 days. Chicks are altricial, or helpless at birth. Both adults feed the chicks by regurgitating food for them, and care for them for 10 to 11 weeks. When adults are threatened while nesting, they may flee, or they may regurgitate on the intruder or feign death.<ref name="Fergus"/> If the chicks are threatened in the nest, they defend themselves by hissing and regurgitating.<ref name="Kaufman"/> The young fledge at about nine to ten weeks. Family groups remain together until fall.<ref name="Kaufman"/>
=== Feeding ===
The turkey vulture feeds primarily on a wide variety of carrion, from small mammals to large grazers, preferring those recently dead, and avoiding carcasses that have reached the point of putrefaction. They may rarely feed on plant matter, shoreline vegetation, pumpkin, coconut<ref></ref> and other crops, live insects and other invertebrates.<ref name="Kaufman"/> In South America, turkey vultures have been photographed feeding on the fruits of the introduced oil palm.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref>Souza, J. S. (2012). urltoken WA794679, Cathartes aura (Linnaeus, 1758). Wiki Aves – A Enciclopédia das Aves do Brasil. Retrieved February 14, 2013</ref> They rarely, if ever, kill prey themselves.<ref name="Kritcher"></ref> The turkey vulture can often be seen along roadsides feeding on roadkill, or near bodies of water, feeding on washed-up fish.<ref name="ADW"/> They also will feed on fish or insects that have become stranded in shallow water.<ref name="Fergus"/> Like other vultures, it plays an important role in the ecosystem by disposing of carrion, which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.<ref name="cotton"/>
The turkey vulture forages by smell, an ability that is uncommon in the avian world, often flying low to the ground to pick up the scent of Ethanethiol, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals.<ref name="snyder"/> The olfaction of its brain, responsible for processing smells, is particularly large compared to that of other animals.<ref name="snyder"></ref> This heightened ability to detect odors allows it to search for carrion below the forest canopy. King vultures, black vultures, and condors, which lack the ability to smell carrion, follow the turkey vulture to carcasses. The turkey vulture arrives first at the carcass, or with greater yellow-headed vultures or lesser yellow-headed vultures, which also share the ability to smell carrion.<ref name="snyder"/> It displaces the yellow-headed vultures from carcasses due to its larger size,<ref name="cotton"></ref> but is displaced in turn by the king vulture and both types of condor, which make the first cut into the skin of the dead animal. This allows the smaller, weaker-billed turkey vulture access to food, because it cannot tear the tough hides of larger animals on its own. This is an example of mutual dependence between species.<ref name="Dietland"></ref>
== Relationship with humans ==
The turkey vulture is sometimes accused of carrying anthrax or hog cholera, both livestock diseases, on its feet or bill by cattle ranchers and is therefore occasionally perceived as a threat.<ref name="mossman">Kirk, D. A., and M. J. Mossman (1998). Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura). The Birds of North America No. 339 (A. Poole and F. Gill, eds.). The Birds of North America, Inc., Philadelphia, PA.</ref> However, the virus that causes hog cholera is destroyed when it passes through the turkey vulture's digestive tract.<ref name="Terres"/> This species also may be perceived as a threat by farmers due to the similar black vulture's tendency to attack and kill newborn cattle. The turkey vulture does not kill live animals but will mix with flocks of black vultures and will scavenge what they leave behind. Nonetheless, its appearance at a location where a calf has been killed gives the incorrect impression that the turkey vulture represents a danger to calves.<ref></ref> The droppings produced by turkey vultures and other vultures can harm or kill trees and other vegetation.<ref></ref> The turkey vulture can be held in captivity, though the Migratory Bird Treaty Act prevents this in the case of uninjured animals or animals capable of returning to the wild.<ref name="cornell"/> In captivity, it can be fed fresh meat, and younger birds will gorge themselves if given the opportunity.<ref name="Terres"/>
The turkey vulture species receives special legal protections under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in the United States,<ref name="FWS"></ref> by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada,<ref name="cornell2"></ref> and by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds and Game Mammals in Mexico.<ref name="cornell2"/> In the US it is illegal to take, kill, or possess turkey vultures, their eggs, and any body parts including but not limited to their feathers; violation of the law is punishable by a fine of up to $100,000 for individuals or $200,000 for organizations, and/or a prison term of 1 year.<ref name="cornell"></ref> It is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN Red List. Populations appear to remain stable, and it has not reached the threshold of inclusion as a threatened species, which requires a decline of more than 30 percent in 10 years or three generations.<ref name=IUCN/>

The turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), also known in some North American regions as the turkey buzzard (or just buzzard), and in some areas of the Caribbean as the John crow or carrion crow,<ref>
 urltoken Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura) . peregrinefund.org
</ref> is the most widespread of the New World vultures.<ref name="Concise"></ref> One of three species in the genus Cathartes of the family Cathartidae, the turkey vulture ranges from southern Canada to the Tierra del Fuego of South America. It inhabits a variety of open and semi-open areas, including subtropical forests, shrublands, pastures, and deserts.<ref name=IUCN/>
Like all New World vultures, it is not closely related to the Old World vultures of Europe, Africa, and Asia. The two groups strongly resemble each other because of convergent evolution; natural selection often leads to similar body plans in animals that adapt independently to the same conditions.
The turkey vulture is a scavenger and feeds almost exclusively on carrion.<ref name="ADW"/> It finds its food using its keen eyes and sense of smell, flying low enough to detect the gasses produced by the beginnings of the process of decay in dead animals.<ref name="ADW"/> In flight, it uses thermals to move through the air, flapping its wings infrequently. It roosts in large community groups. Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses.<ref name="Miskimen"></ref> It nests in caves, hollow trees, or thickets. Each year it generally raises two chicks, which it feeds by regurgitation.<ref name="Fergus"/> It has very few natural predators.<ref name="snyder"/> In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.<ref name="FWS"/>
