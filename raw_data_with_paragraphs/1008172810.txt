Yahoo!

==History==
===Founding===
In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".<ref>. yhoo.client.shareholder.com</ref><ref></ref> The site was a Web directory, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!".<ref></ref><ref></ref> The human-edited Yahoo! Directory, provided for users to surf through the Internet, became their first product and the company's original purpose.<ref name="Directory"> urltoken The Yahoo Directory — Once The Internet’s Most Important Search Engine — Is To Close September 26, 2014, retrieved in June 3, 2017</ref><ref> urltoken Yahoo schließt seinen Katalog from golem.de, September 27, 2014, retrieved in June 3, 2017</ref> The "yahoo.com" domain was created on January 18, 1995.<ref></ref>
The word "yahoo" is a backronym for "Yet another Hierarchically Organized Oracle"<ref></ref> or "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".<ref></ref> The term "hierarchical" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.<ref></ref> However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."<ref></ref> This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels.
In 1995, a search engine function, called Yahoo! Search, was introduced. This allowed users to search Yahoo! Directory.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Yahoo soon became the first popular online directory and search engine on the World Wide Web.<ref></ref>
===Expansion===
Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Yahoo became a public company via an initial public offering in April 1996 and its stock price rose 600% within two years.<ref name="auto"></ref> Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal, putting it in competition with services like Excite, Lycos and America Online.<ref></ref> By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users,<ref></ref> and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine,<ref name="Directory"/> receiving 95 million page views per day which was triple the number compared to rival Excite.<ref name="auto"/> It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Yahoo began offering free e-mail from October 1997 after the acquisition of RocketMail, which was then renamed to Yahoo! Mail.<ref></ref> In 1998, Yahoo decided to replace AltaVista as the crawler-based search engine underlying the Directory with Inktomi.<ref></ref> Yahoo's two biggest acquisitions were made in 1999 – that of Geocities for $3.6 billion,<ref></ref> and Broadcast.com for $5.7 billion.<ref></ref>
Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, closing at an all-time high of $118.75/share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.<ref name="StockAllTimeLow"></ref>
Yahoo began using Google for search in June 2000.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004 partly using technology from its $280 million acquisition of Inktomi in 2002.<ref></ref> In response to Google's Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs.<ref></ref>
In February 2008, Microsoft made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo! for $44.6 billion.<ref></ref><ref name="Yahoo!-Inc-Feb-2008-425"></ref> Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it "substantially undervalues" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders.<ref name="Yahoo!-Inc-May-2008-8-K"></ref><ref name="Yahoo!-Inc-Jun-2008-8-K"></ref> By 2011, Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion (only half of what it had been offered by Microsoft three years earlier).<ref></ref> Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009.<ref name="Yahoo!-Inc-Jan-2009-8-K"></ref><ref></ref> In September 2011, she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company's chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.<ref name="Yahoo!-Inc-Sep-2011-8-K"></ref><ref></ref>
In early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. Several key executives left, including Chief Product Officer Blake Irving.<ref name="Yahoo!-Inc-Apr-2012-10-K/A"></ref><ref></ref> On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs,<ref name="Yahoo!-Inc-Apr-2012-8-K"></ref> or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. The cut was expected to save around $375 million annually after the layoffs were completed at end of 2012.<ref></ref> In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.<ref name="Swisher"></ref>
On May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn,<ref name="Yahoo!-Inc-May-2012-8-K"></ref> recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group.<ref name="Swisher" /><ref></ref><ref></ref> Thompson's total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.<ref name="CNN ousted"></ref>
On July 15, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed president and CEO of Yahoo, effective July 17, 2012.<ref name="Yahoo!-Inc-Jul-2012-8-K"></ref><ref>Matt McGee, Search Engine Land. " urltoken Confirmed: Marissa Mayer Leaving Google For Yahoo CEO Role ." July 16, 2012 . Retrieved March 27, 2017.</ref>
On May 19, 2013 Yahoo! announced the $1.1 billion acquisition of blogging site Tumblr.<ref name="Yahoo!-Inc-Jun-2013-8-K"></ref><ref name="Yahoo!-Inc-May-2013-8-K"></ref> Tumblr's CEO and founder David Karp became a large shareholder. The announcement reportedly signified a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquired start-up Internet companies that generated low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. The Wall Street Journal stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy Yahoo's need for "a thriving social-networking and communications hub."<ref></ref><ref></ref> The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013.<ref> urltoken Yahoo Plans Splashy New San Francisco Digs (and Neon Billboard Dreams) – Kara Swisher – News .

===Decline, security breaches, and Verizon purchase===
By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013.<ref></ref> It did go up to $36.04 in the mid-afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling Internet business,<ref></ref> and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China's Alibaba e-commerce site.<ref></ref> Not all had gone well during Mayer's tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, told The Washington Post that sometimes, "the single best thing you can do . is sell the company."<ref></ref>
On February 2, 2016, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer annoyed layoffs amounting to 15% of its workforce.<ref></ref>
On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced the acquisition of Yahoo's core Internet business for $4.83 billion.<ref name="Yahoo!-Inc-Jul-2016-8-K"></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath Inc. on June 13, 2017;<ref name="Yahoo!-Inc-Jul-2017-8-K"></ref> Yahoo, AOL, and HuffPost were to continue operating under their own names, under the Oath Inc. umbrella.<ref name="verge-oath"></ref> The deal excluded Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! Japan.<ref name="Yahoo!-Inc-Aug-2016-DEFA14A"></ref><ref name="Yahoo!-Inc-Jul-2016-2-8-K"></ref> Following the completion of the acquisition, these assets were retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team.<ref name="Yahoo-Jun-2017-8-K"></ref><ref name="Altaba-Jun-2017-2-8-K"></ref><ref></ref>
On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts,<ref name="Yahoo!-Inc-Sep-2016-8-K"></ref><ref name="Yahoo Says Hackers Stole Data on 500 Million Users in 2014"></ref> one of the largest breaches reported to date.<ref></ref> The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack.<ref></ref><ref></ref> On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts.<ref></ref> The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to forge HTTP cookies.<ref></ref>
In response to these breaches, Bloomberg News reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million,<ref name="bloomberg-lower"></ref> causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices.<ref name="usatoday-verizonshaved"/> On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches.<ref name="usatoday-verizonshaved"></ref>

Also, starting in mid-to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable. The blog on the del.icio.us website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that "Sunset" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. Yeh further explained that other possibilities—including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)—were still being considered: "We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press."<ref></ref> On April 27, 2011, Yahoo's sale of del.icio.us to Avos was announced.<ref></ref>

==Logos and themes==
Yahoo got its first logo during its establishment in 1994—it consists of the "Yahoo" wordmark which is colored black and is using the Times New Roman font, but it was later changed.
In March 1995, when the company changed its name to Yahoo, it introduced another logo which is briefly changed to a more elaborate text that includes an exclamation point at the end, but it were short-lived for only 5 months.
Later, in August 1995, that same year, Yahoo changed its logo again and it became a stylized yellow jumping "Y" figurine on a blue circle while the "Yahoo!" wordmark is written below, but the logo were also short-lived for 4 months until December 1995.
On January 1, 1996, Yahoo introduced a simplified new logo that included the text "Yahoo" and an exclamation mark, both in red with a slight shadow behind the text.<ref></ref> By May 2009, Yahoo tweaked the logo by recoloring it from red to purple and removing the logo's outline and shadow. At the time, the purple logo was accompanied by a new slogan, "It's Y!ou." A shortened variant of the logo, consisting of only the letter "Y" and an exclamation point, was also used.<ref></ref>
On August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013 at 4:00&nbsp;a.m. UTC. In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the "30 Days of Change" campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page.<ref></ref> Mayer explains:
<blockquote>So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team . We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo – whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.<ref></ref></blockquote>
On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the "My Yahoo" personalized homepage. The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. Users can also select "theme packs" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun.<ref></ref> Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees.<ref name="Sew"></ref>

The logo is a white text set against a purple background, with both the “y” and “!” of the logo reportedly set at an angle of 22.5 degrees.<ref></ref>
