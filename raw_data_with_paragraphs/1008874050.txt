GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)

==Gameplay==
GoldenEye 007 is a first-person shooter that features single and multiplayer modes. In the single-player mode, the player takes the role of James Bond through a series of free-roaming 3D levels. Each level requires the player to complete a set of objectives—such as collecting or destroying specified items, rescuing hostages, or meeting with friendly non-player characters—and then exit the stage.<ref name="Gaming Age review" /> Some gadgets from the James Bond films are featured and are often used to complete objectives.<ref name="Edge review" /> For example, in one level, the electromagnetic watch from Live and Let Die is used to acquire a jail cell key.<ref name="IGN review" />
Weapons include pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles, grenades, and throwing knife.<ref name="GameRev review" /> Guns have a finite magazine and must be reloaded after a certain number of shots, but the player may carry as many weapons as they can find. The player's initial weapon in most missions is the Walther PPK (named the PP7). Most firearms are modelled on real weapons, and others are based on James Bond devices, such as the Golden Gun and Moonraker laser. Characteristics vary such as rate of fire, degree of penetration, and type of ammunition used, and inflict different levels of damage depending on which body part they hit.<ref name="GS game guide" /><ref name="Weapons details" /> Stealth is significant, and frequent gunfire can alert distant guards,<ref name="Nowgamer Interview" /> and alarms can trigger infinitely-respawning enemies. Certain weapons incorporate suppressor or telescopic sight attachments to aid the player in killing enemies discreetly.<ref name="GS game guide" /> There are no health-recovery items, although armour vests can be acquired to provide a secondary health bar.
Four Saved game are available to track the player's progress through the twenty missions, each of which may be played on three difficulty settings.<ref name="GS game guide" /> Higher difficulties affect factors such as the damage enemies can withstand and inflict, the amount of ammunition available, and the number of objectives that must be completed.<ref name="GS game guide" /> Players can replay previous levels and complete mission within target times to unlock bonus cheat options.<ref name="GS game guide" /> Upon completing the game on the hardest setting, an additional mode is unlocked, allowing the player to customise the difficulty of a mission by manually enemies' health, reaction times, aiming accuracy, and the damage they inflict.<ref name="GS game guide" />
=== Mutiplayer ===
In the multiplayer mode, up to four players to compete in five types of split-screen deathmatch: Normal, You Only Live Twice, The Living Daylights (Flag Tag), The Man With the Golden Gun, and Licence to Kill.<ref name="Manual" /> Normal is a basic deathmatch mode in which the main objective is to kill opponents as many times as possible. It can be played as a free-for-all game or in teams.<ref name="Manual" /> In You Only Live Twice, players only have two lives before they are eliminated from the game, while Licence to Kill is a mode in which players die from a single hit with any weapon.<ref name="EGM98" /> In The Man With the Golden Gun, a single Golden Gun, which is capable of killing opponents with one shot, is placed in a fixed location on the map; once the Golden Gun is picked up, the only way to re-acquire it is to kill the player holding it.<ref name="EGM98" /> The player with the Golden Gun is unable to pick up body armour.<ref name="Manual" /> In The Living Daylights, a flag is placed in a fixed location on the map, and the player who holds it the longest wins.<ref name="EGM98" /> The flag carrier cannot use weapons but can collect them to keep opponents from stocking ammunition.<ref name="Manual" /> In each game type, players can customise elements such as the map, class of weapons, and winning condition.<ref name="Manual" /> As players progress through the single player mode, new maps and characters are unlocked in the multiplayer mode.<ref name="GS game guide" />
==Plot==
In 1986 Arkhangelsk, Soviet Union, MI6 has uncovered a secret chemical weapons facility at the Byelomorye Dam.<ref name="GoldenEye 007" group=lower-greek /> James Bond and fellow 00-agent Alec Trevelyan are sent to infiltrate the facility and plant explosive charges.<ref name="GoldenEye 0071" group=lower-greek /> During the mission, Trevelyan is shot by Colonel Arkady Ourumov, while Bond escapes by commandeering an aeroplane.<ref name="GoldenEye 0072" group=lower-greek /> Five years later in 1991, Bond is sent to investigate a satellite control station in Severnaya Zemlya,<ref name="GoldenEye 0073" group=lower-greek /> where programmer Boris Grishenko works. Two years after the Severnaya mission, Bond investigates an unscheduled test firing of a missile in Kyrgyzstan, believed to be a cover for the launch of a satellite known as GoldenEye.<ref name="GoldenEye 0074" group=lower-greek /> This space-based weapon works by firing a concentrated electromagnetic pulse at any Earth target to disable any electrical circuit within range. As Bond leaves the silo, he is ambushed by Ourumov and a squad of Russian troops. Ourumov manages to escape during the encounter.
In 1995, Bond visits Monte Carlo to investigate the frigate La Fayette, where he rescues several hostages and plants a tracker bug on the Pirate helicopter before it is stolen by the Janus crime syndicate.<ref name="GoldenEye 0075" group=lower-greek /> Bond is then sent a second time to Severnaya, but during the mission he is captured and locked up in the bunker's cells along with Natalya Simonova, a captive computer programmer unwilling to work with Janus. They both escape the complex seconds before it is destroyed, on the orders of Ourumov, by the GoldenEye satellite's EMP. Bond next travels to Saint Petersburg, where he arranges with ex-KGB agent Valentin Zukovsky to meet the chief of the Janus organisation.<ref name="GoldenEye 0076" group=lower-greek /> This is revealed to be Alec Trevelyan – his execution by Ourumov in the Arkhangelsk facility was faked. Bond and Natalya escape from Trevelyan, but are arrested by the Russian police and taken to the military archives for interrogation. Bond eventually manages to escape the interrogation room, rescue Natalya, and communicate with Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin, who has verified Bond's claim of Ourumov's treachery.<ref name="GoldenEye 0077" group=lower-greek /> Natalya is recaptured by General Ourumov, and Bond gives chase through the streets of St. Petersburg,<ref name="GoldenEye 0078" group=lower-greek /> eventually reaching an arms depot used by Janus. There, Bond destroys its weaponry stores and then hitches a ride on Trevelyan's ex-Soviet missile train,<ref name="GoldenEye 0079" group=lower-greek /> where he kills Ourumov and rescues Natalya. However, Alec Trevelyan and his ally Xenia Onatopp escape to their secret base in Cuba.<ref name="GoldenEye 00710" group=lower-greek />
Natalya accompanies Bond to the Caribbean. Surveying the Cuban jungle aerially, their light aircraft is shot down. Unscathed, Bond and Natalya perform a ground search of the area's heavily guarded jungle terrain, but are ambushed by Xenia,<ref name="GoldenEye 00711" group=lower-greek /> who is quickly killed by Bond. Bond sneaks Natalya into the control centre to disrupt transmissions to the GoldenEye satellite and force it to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere.<ref name="GoldenEye 00712" group=lower-greek /> He then follows the fleeing Trevelyan through a series of flooded caverns,<ref name="GoldenEye 00713" group=lower-greek /> eventually arriving at the antenna of the control centre's radio telescope. Trevelyan attempts to re-align it in a final attempt to restore contact with the GoldenEye,<ref name="GoldenEye 00714" group=lower-greek /> but Bond destroys machinery vital to controlling the antenna and defeats Trevelyan in a gunfight on a platform above the dish.
==Development==
===Design===
GoldenEye 007 was developed by the British studio Rare and directed by Martin Hollis, who had previously worked as a second programmer on the coin-op version of Killer Instinct.<ref name="Gamasutra Hollis"/> In November 1994, after Nintendo and Rare discussed the possibility of developing a game based on the upcoming James Bond film GoldenEye, Hollis told Tim Stamper, Rare's managing director, that he was interested in the project.<ref name="Zoonami article"/> Due to the success of Rare's 1994 game Donkey Kong Country, GoldenEye 007 was originally suggested as a 2D platformer for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.<ref name="Nowgamer Interview" /> However, Hollis proposed a 3D shooting game for the upcoming Nintendo 64 console.<ref name="Zoonami article"/> He created a document with design ideas, including gadgets, weapons, characters, story digression from the film, and artificial intelligence (AI) that would react to the player.<ref name="Zoonami article"/>
Sega's 1994 light gun shooter Virtua Cop was the primary influence, although id Software's seminal 1993 first person shooter Doom and the Nintendo 64 launch game Super Mario 64 were also credited.<ref name="Zoonami article"/> Features such as gun reloading, position-dependent hit reaction animations, penalties for killing innocent characters, and the aiming system activated with the R button of the Nintendo 64 controller were adopted from Virtua Cop.<ref name="Zoonami article"/> The developers considered having players reload weapons by unplugging and re-inserting the Rumble Pak on the controller, but Nintendo opposed the idea.<ref name="Nowgamer Interview" /> The concept of several varied objectives within each mission was inspired by the multiple tasks in each stage of Super Mario 64.<ref name="Guardian Hollis"/>
The team visited the studios of the GoldenEye film several times to collect photographs and blueprints of the sets.<ref name="Nowgamer Interview" /><ref name="Nintendo GoldenEye development" /> Eon Productions and MGM, the companies that control the James Bond films, granted the team a broad licence,<ref name="GDC Hollis"/> and many levels were extended or modified to allow the player to participate in sequences not seen in the film.<ref name="Zoonami article"/> Although the reference material was used for authenticity, the team was not afraid to add to it to help the game design.<ref name="Nowgamer Interview" /> John Woo films such as Hard Boiled influenced the visual effects and kinetic moments. Details such as bullet marks on walls, cartridge cases being ejected from guns, and objects exploding were part of the design.<ref name="Zoonami article"/> Hollis wanted players to receive a lot of feedback from the environment when they shot.<ref name="GDC Hollis"/>
The team considered implementing both on-rails and free-roaming modes because they did not know how the Nintendo 64 controller would work;<ref name="Zoonami article" /> GoldenEyes gas plant location was modelled by Hilton with a predetermined path in mind.<ref name="Nowgamer Interview" /> A modified Sega Saturn controller was used for some early playtesting.<ref name="Nowgamer Interview" /> The designers' initial priority was purely on the creation of interesting spaces; level design and balance considerations such as the placement of start and exit points, characters and objectives did not begin until this process was complete.<ref name="Zoonami article" /> According to Hollis, "The benefit of this sloppy unplanned approach was that many of the levels in the game have a realistic and non-linear feel. There are rooms with no direct relevance to the level. There are multiple routes across the level."<ref name="Zoonami article" />
===Production===
Image:SGI-onyx.jpg|thumb|right|An SGI Onyx graphics supercomputer was used during the first stages of development.
Work on GoldenEye 007 began in January 1995<ref name="Golden touch"/> with a team hired by Hollis: programmer Mark Edmonds, background artist Karl Hilton, and character artist B. Jones.<ref name="GDC Hollis"/> Edmonds focused on creating a game engine that could render 3D graphics from art packages into Nintendo 64 data structures.<ref name="Zoonami article"/> Hilton modelled levels based on the film material, while Jones constructed characters based on photos and costumes they had.<ref name="Zoonami article"/> Since final Nintendo 64 specifications and development kits were not initially available to Rare, the team had to estimate the finalised console's capabilities using an SGI Onyx workstation and Nintendo's custom NINGEN development software.<ref name="Zoonami article"/><ref name="Nintendo GoldenEye development" /> In the following months, designer Duncan Botwood joined the team to construct the levels. The first year was spent producing art assets and developing the engine, which originally only allowed the player and enemies to move around a virtual environment.<ref name="Zoonami article"/>
After the first year of development, Rare added more staff to the project. The first addition was designer David Doak, who helped with the level designs and worked on the game's AI scripting.<ref name="Zoonami article" /> He explained how the game's stealth elements were implemented: "Whenever you fired a gun, it had a radius test and alerted the non-player characters within that radius. If you fired the same gun again within a certain amount of time, it did a larger radius test and I think there was a third even larger radius after that. It meant if you found one guy and shot him in the head and then didn't fire again, the timer would reset."<ref name="Nowgamer Interview" /> Windows throughout the game were programmed so that enemies cannot see through them while the player can. Though unrealistic, this was an intentional feature made to encourage the player to use windows to spy on enemies.<ref name="Zoonami article" />
A second programmer, Steve Ellies, was hired by Hollis six months later.<ref name="Zoonami article" /> Although Ellies assisted the development team in many areas and programmed the cheat options, he was mostly responsible for implementing the game's multiplayer mode,<ref name="GDC Hollis" /> which was added to the game roughly six months before it was released.<ref name="N64 interview" /> According to Doak, Ellies "sat in a room with all the code written for a single-player game and turned GoldenEye into a multiplayer game."<ref name="David Doak Retro Gamer" /> The team spent numerous late evenings playtesting it.<ref name="Golden touch" /> The multiplayer levels are based on single-player missions and some of them do not support four players because they were initially not designed to handle multiplayer action.<ref name="N64 interview" />
Because the team assumed they could use anything from the James Bond universe, the multiplayer mode features characters that appear in previous Bond films.<ref name="Oral History" /> Actors who portrayed Bond in previous films were also playable during development, but had to be removed because Rare was unable to get Sean Connery's permission to use his likeness.<ref name="Ars RareReplay" /> Adrian Smith, the game's third and last artist, who had already worked on some games at Rare,<ref name="Zoonami article" /> was in charge of producing visual effects such as muzzle flashes and explosions. He mentioned the 1995 film Heat as an influence.<ref name="GDC Hollis" /> A firing range was modelled as an environment, but was not added to the game.<ref name="GDC Hollis" />
The final Nintendo 64 hardware could render polygons faster than the SGI Onyx workstation the development team had been using. This helped the developers significantly, as some backgrounds rendered at 2 frames per second on the Onyx without even drawing enemies, objects, or Bond's gun.<ref name="Zoonami article" /> However, the game's textures had to be cut down by half.<ref name="Nowgamer Interview" /> Hilton explained one method of improving the game's performance: "A lot of GoldenEye is in black and white. RGB colour textures cost a lot more in terms of processing power. You could do double the resolution if you used greyscale, so a lot was done like that. If I needed a bit of colour, I'd add it in the vertex."<ref name="Nowgamer Interview" /> When Super Mario 64 was released in 1996, the 3D collision detection system of the game was very influential for Hollis because GoldenEye 007 was using a 2D method.<ref name="Nowgamer Interview" />
The music was primarily composed by Graeme Norgate and Grant Kirkhope. Norgate previously penned the music of Blast Corps, while Kirkhope composed the music of Donkey Kong Land 2.<ref name="N64 interview" /> Robin Beanland, the game's third composer, only wrote the elevator music that can be heard in certain levels.<ref name="GDC Hollis" /> All the sound effects were created by Norgate and a lot of effort was put into combining and permuting sounds in different ways to give the game a satisfying feel.<ref name="GDC Hollis" /> According to Hollis, whenever the player shoots a gun, up to nine different sound effects will randomly trigger.<ref name="GDC Hollis" /> 
=== Release ===
When the game was reviewed by Nintendo shortly before it was released, the company was slightly concerned about the amount of violence and gunplay. As a result, the team toned down the killing and added an end credits sequence that introduces all the non-player characters, giving the game a filmic sense.<ref name="Guardian Hollis" /> The game received a Teen rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board.<ref name="N64 interview" />
GoldenEye 007 was released on a 96-megabit cartridge on 25 August 1997.<ref name="Cartridge size" /> Although this was over a year and a half after the release of the film it was based on, the timing allowed the game to benefit from publicity for the upcoming James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies.<ref name="Edge review" /> Every cartridge of the game contains a ZX Spectrum emulator with ten Rare developed games. This function was originally made as an experimental side project by Rare and was deactivated in the final build of the game, but has since been unlocked through fan-made patches.<ref name="zx" /> The actual development of GoldenEye 007 took more than two and a half years to complete and a total of US$2 million was spent on the game.<ref name="Guardian Hollis" />

GoldenEye 007 is a 1997 first-person shooter developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. Based on the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye, it features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of British Secret Intelligence Service agent James Bond as he fights to prevent a criminal syndicate from using a Space weapon against London to cause a global financial meltdown. The game includes a split-screen multiplayer mode in which up to four players can compete in different types of deathmatch games.
Development began in 1995 and was handled by an inexperienced team led by Martin Hollis, who had previously worked as a programmer on the coin-op version of Killer Instinct. It was primarily inspired by Sega's Virtua Cop before being redesigned as a free-roaming shooter. After two and a half years of development, GoldenEye 007 was released shortly before the release of the GoldenEye sequel Tomorrow Never Dies. Although the game faced low expectations from the gaming media, it received critical acclaim and sold more than eight million copies, making it the third-best-selling Nintendo 64 game. The game was praised for its visuals, gameplay depth and variety, and multiplayer mode. In 1998, it received the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Games Award and four awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences.
Retrospectively, GoldenEye 007 is considered an important game in the history of first-person shooters for demonstrating the viability of game consoles as platforms for the genre, and for signalling a transition from the then-standard Doom-like approach to a more realistic style. It pioneered features such as atmospheric single-player missions, stealth elements, and a console multiplayer deathmatch mode. The game is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. A spiritual successor, Perfect Dark, was released in 2000. A reimagining of the game, also titled GoldenEye 007, was released in 2010.
