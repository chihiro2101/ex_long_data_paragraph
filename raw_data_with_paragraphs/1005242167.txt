=== Chechen wars and the interwar period ===
After Russian forces entered Chechnya, starting the First Chechen War, Zakayev left his job and took up arms. Serving at first as a minor commander in the unit of Ruslan Gelayev, he took part in the 1995 battle of Grozny and then led the defence of the village of Goyskoye. After this the armed group under his command operated in the south-west part of Chechnya with its headquarters in the town of Urus-Martan. He was eventually promoted to the rank of Brigadier General and appointed commander of the Urus-Martan Front. In February 1996, Zakayev became commander of the entire Western Group of Defense of Ichkeria. In August 1996, his forces took part in the decisive raid on Grozny,<ref> urltoken Risky Walk in Rebel-Held Chechen Capital , The New York Times, 14 August 1996</ref> where he personally led the attack on the city's central railway station.<ref> urltoken Moscow Gives More Evidence On Zakayev , The St. Petersburg Times, 3 December 2002</ref> Zakayev's war service paved his way to Chechen high politics. He became the acting president Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev's advisor for the security matters and the secretary of the Chechen Security Council and represented Chechnya at the Khasav-Yurt Accord, which brought a peaceful end to the first armed conflict between Moscow and Grozny.
After the war, Zakayev became Chechen Deputy Prime Minister (in charge of education and culture) and a special envoy of elected President of Ichkeria Aslan Maskhadov for relations with Moscow, taking part in the delegation that signed the official Chechen-Russian peace treaty at the Kremlin in 1997.<ref> urltoken Chechnya: The Turning Point That Wasn't, RFE/RL, 11 May 2007 </ref> During the interwar period, he opposed the rise of radical Islam in Chechnya and co-authored a book entitled Wahhabism - the Kremlin's remedy against national liberation movements, alleging an association between Islamism extremism and Soviet global "pro-terrorist" policy and support for dictatorships in the Muslim world. During the early phases of the Second Chechen War in 1999–2000, Zakayev commanded Maskhadov's presidential guard; he was also involved in negotiations with Russian representatives before and during the resumed hostilities. In 2000, having been wounded in a car accident during the new siege of Grozny, he left Chechnya for treatment. After this he stayed abroad and became President Maskhadov's most prominent representative in Western Europe, while Ilyas Akhmadov was the Chechen emissary to the United States.
=== In exile ===
Since January 2002, Zakayev and his immediate family have been residing permanently in the United Kingdom. On 18 November 2001, Zakayev, officially internationally wanted by Russia, flew from Turkey to the Sheremetyevo International Airport near Moscow to meet the Kremlin's envoy, General Viktor Kazantsev for the high-level talks since the start of the war.<ref> urltoken Moscow opens Chechnya peace talks , BBC News, 18 November 2001</ref><ref> urltoken Russian, Chechen Rebel Envoy Hold First Talks Since War Began , Los Angeles Times, 19 November 2001</ref><ref> urltoken Kremlin and Rebel Envoys Discuss Peace for Chechnya , The New York Times, 19 November 2001</ref><ref> urltoken Russia opens talks with Chechens , CNN, 19 November 2001</ref><ref> urltoken Chechnya Peace Talks Get Under Way , The St. Petersburg Times, 20 November 2001</ref> These negotiations were fruitless because Kazantsev demanded a complete capitulation of the Chechen side, with the only acceptable topic for the Russian side being the disarmament of Chechen separatists and their re-integration into civilian life.<ref> urltoken Long negotiations with unclear results , Prague Watchdog, 16 November 2001</ref> On 18 July 2002, Zakayev also met with the former Secretary of Security Council of Russia Ivan Rybkin in Zürich, Switzerland.<ref> urltoken Prominent Candidates for Russia's Presidency , Pravda, 12 December 2004</ref>
In October 2002, Zakayev organized the urltoken World Chechen Congress in Copenhagen, Denmark (which was attended among others by the former first speaker of the State Duma, Ruslan Khasbulatov). During the congress, Zakayev was accused by Russia of involvement in planning of the Moscow theater hostage crisis. He was detained there on 30 October 2002, under an Interpol warrant filed by Russia, which named him a suspect in the theater siege.<ref> urltoken Russian to the Core , TIME, 3 November 2002</ref><ref name="dissident">Alex Goldfarb and Marina Litvinenko.

He was held in Denmark for five weeks and then released due to lack of evidence, as Russia's formal extradition request did not include any evidence linking him to the siege.<ref name="dissident"/><ref> urltoken Russia pushes for Chechen extradition , BBC News, 2 November 2002</ref><ref> urltoken Denmark frees top Chechen envoy , BBC News, 3 December 2002</ref><ref> urltoken Zakayev Evidence On Shaky Ground , The St. Petersburg Times, 19 November 2002</ref>
On 7 December 2002, Zakayev returned to the UK but the British authorities arrested him briefly at London Heathrow Airport; he was released on 50,000 GBP bail, which was paid by British actress Vanessa Redgrave, his friend who had travelled with him from Denmark. He was accused by Russian authorities of 13 criminal acts<ref name="bbc_accused"/> Zakayev welcomed the British deportation hearings as an opportunity to put his case before an international public.<ref> urltoken Zakayev Welcomes Deportation Trial, Institute for War and Peace Reporting, 21 February 2003</ref> All accusations were proven to be false.<ref name="dissident"/> One accusation, cutting fingers of a suspected FSB informer Ivan Solovyov, was based on a written testimony by Zakayev's former bodyguard, Duk-Vakha Dushuyev, provided by Russian authorities; however, it appeared that Solovyev had lost his fingers much earlier to frostbite. Dushuyev himself has escaped from Russia and then in his statement claimed that he was tortured at a Russian army base with electric shocks to extort the false testimony to be used against Zakayev.<ref name="dissident"/><ref> urltoken Key witness in Chechen extradition case 'was tortured', The Independent, 25 July 2003 </ref><ref> urltoken Evidence gathered by torture , BBC News, 31 July 2003</ref><ref> urltoken Kadyrov Accused of Intimidation ,The St. Petersburg Times, 9 September 2003</ref> In another accusation, Father Sergei, one of two Russian Orthodox Church priests allegedly murdered by Zakayev, turned out to be in fact still alive. The witness Reverend Filipp, allegedly kidnapped by Zakayev in 1996, also refuted his supposed testimony and even denounced Russian authorities for "implicating the Church in politics". Leading Russian human rights activist Sergei Kovalev told the court Zakayev would be at risk of death in Russian captivity (Kovalev spoke about two high-profile Chechen prisoners, field commanders Salman Raduyev and Turpal-Ali Atgeriyev, who died soon after being jailed in Russia, and of another, parliamentary speaker Ruslan Alikhadzhiyev, who has "disappeared" without trace after his arrest in 2000).<ref name=mrY/> According to Alexander Goldfarb, one of the defence's most important arguments was the 2001 meeting between Zakayev and General Kazantsev, since this meeting took place when the Chechen envoy had already been put by Russia on the international wanted list. At the time of the meeting Kremlin's spokesman on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky said on television that Russian government had no grievances against Zakayev.<ref name="mrY"> urltoken Zakayev saved by Mr Y , Gazeta.Ru, 2003/07/01</ref> Therefore, on 13 November 2003, Judge Timothy Workman rejected the Russian request, deciding that it was politically motivated and that Zakayev would be at risk of torture in the case of "unjust and oppressive" extradition.<ref name="autogenerated2003"/><ref> urltoken Judge rejects bid to extradite Chechen rebel leader, The Guardian, 13 November 2003</ref><ref> urltoken Russia Loses Fight Over Chechen's Extradition, The New York Times, 29 November 2008</ref> The judge also said the crimes which involved Zakayev allegedly using armed force against combatants were not extraditable because they took place in the situation of civil war.<ref> urltoken Chechen rebel defeats Putin's extradition plea , The Telegraph, 13 November 2003</ref><ref> urltoken Russian request to extradite Chechen exile is turned down , The Independent, 14 November 2003</ref> Russian authorities in turn responded by accusing the court of double standards.<ref> urltoken UK accused of hypocrisy on terror , BBC News, 13 November 2003</ref> On 29 November 2003, it was announced that Zakayev had been granted political asylum in the UK.<ref> urltoken Chechen envoy granted UK asylum , BBC News, 9 November 2003</ref>
After receiving political asylum in Britain in 2003, Zakayev made London his permanent residence, and he visited several countries (including France, Germany and Poland) without being arrested. During the September 2004 Beslan school hostage crisis, Zakayev consented to the request of the civilian negotiators and authorities of North Ossetia–Alania to fly to Russia to negotiate with the hostage takers.

These efforts were ignored by the Russian government and Maskhadov himself was soon killed in Chechnya.
On 31 October 2007, Zakayev officially distanced himself from the newly resigned Chechen separatist leader Doku Umarov and the Chechen Islamist ideologist Movladi Udugov, who together had declared the creation of Caucasus Emirate in the place of abolished ChRI. In response, Zakayev called for the remnants of the separatist parliament to form the new government and salvage legitimacy.<ref> urltoken Statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria , Chechenpress, 31 October 2007</ref> Soon after, on 20 November 2007, Zakayev submitted his resignation from the ministerial post, but said this should not be viewed as a departure from "the fight for our independence, our freedom, and for the recognition of our state".<ref> urltoken Foreign Minister Of Chechen Separatist Government Resigns , RFE/RL, 20 November 2007</ref> In September 2008, Ramzan Kadyrov said he was now trying to persuade Chechens refugees and exiles to return, including Akhmed Zakayev, whom Kadyrov described as "a valuable artist who would be welcome to return to help revive Chechnya's cultural heritage."<ref> urltoken US 'provoked Russia-Georgia war' , BBC News, 10 September 2008</ref> Zakayev and Alla Dudayeva, the widow of the first Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, accused Udugov of being a paid agent provocateur for the Russia's FSB.<ref> urltoken Russia: Is North Caucasus Resistance Still Serious Threat?, RFE/RL, 1 November 2007 </ref>

== Invitation to return to Chechnya ==
On 11 February 2009, Ramzan Kadyrov said he personally invited Zakayev to return to Chechnya if he does not want to be "used by special services and other forces against Russia".

On 23 August 2009, in a controversial move, he was reportedly dismissed as prime minister by the Chairman of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria parliament in exile, as he "transgressed his mandate and recognized the legitimacy of the Kremlin’s puppet regime",<ref> urltoken Saralyapov Accused and Dismissed to Zakayev Waynakh.com, 23 August 2009</ref> and shortly afterwards, he was Capital punishment by Sharia Court of the Caucasus Emirate, because he "professes democratic religion, propagates secularism, and prefers the laws established by men to the Shari'a law of Almighty and Great Allah."<ref> urltoken North Caucasus Resistance Sentences Chechen Leader To Death Radio Free Europe, 25 August 2009</ref>
