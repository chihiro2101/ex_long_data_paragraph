==Artistry and influences==
Many of Valo's songs deal with themes of love.<ref name="Jussi692012"/> While talking about his songwriting, Valo stated: "I feel like there is no subject more important for a song than relationships. It's the only thing than moves me."<ref name="Jussi692012"></ref> He also takes some inspiration from literature, explaining: "As a guy who writes songs, I get excited about an idea, or a book, or a sentence. I don't necessarily get excited about the whole of Tolkien, I just get excited about Uruk-hai. Just a little detail that just makes my mind work overdrive."<ref name="LoudLegacy"/> Valo and the rest of HIM referred to their music as "love metal", the idea of which was to combine more melodic and melancholic elements, with heavier influences.<ref name="Interview"/><ref name="Interview2003"></ref> Valo has described HIM's music as "sentimental, hard-hitting rock".<ref name="InterviewYouRock"></ref> Some of Valo's favorite artists and musical influences include Black Sabbath, Type O Negative,<ref name="Interview"></ref><ref></ref><ref name="suicidegirls.com"/> Neil Young,<ref name="suicidegirls.com"></ref> The Sisters of Mercy, Fields of the Nephilim,<ref name="youtube.com"></ref> Johnny Cash, Depeche Mode,<ref name="crypticrock"></ref> Elvis Presley, Rauli Somerjoki and Tapio Rautavaara.<ref name="Tapsa"></ref><ref name="Iskelmä"></ref> Some of his non-musical influences include Edgar Allan Poe, H.P.

Mukka, Charles Baudelaire and Charles Bukowski,<ref name="MetalHammerPg29"/><ref name="MetalHammerPg30"/><ref name="MetalHammerPg33">Metal Hammer Presents HIM: Tears On Tape Fanpack Magazine - pg. 33</ref> as well as Austin Osman Spare, Maya Deren and Shigeo Fukuda.<ref name="MetalHammerPg35">Metal Hammer Presents HIM: Tears On Tape Fanpack Magazine - pg. 35</ref><ref name="MetalHammerPg37">Metal Hammer Presents HIM: Tears On Tape Fanpack Magazine - pg. 37</ref> 
Much of HIM's success has been attributed to Valo's songwriting ability, as well as his image and charisma.<ref name="HSAnalyysi"></ref> In 2004, Metal Hammer magazine described Valo as one of the few new "rockstars" in music, stating: "HIM were like no other band. They had a special something, but more importantly they had a special someone. Ville shone like a star with his blend of Mick Jagger posturing and Brandon Lee's dark charms in The Crow".<ref name="BriefHistory">Metal Hammer: A Brief History of HIM Pg. 8</ref><ref name="BriefHistory2">Metal Hammer: A Brief History of HIM Pg. 9</ref> Helsingin Sanomat described Valo's image as utilizing "the tried and true James Dean formula, where sensitivity and edginess combined."<ref name="HSAnalyysi"/> Valo possesses a baritone voice type with a five octave range, and was found by VVN Music to possess the eight-highest vocal range of any known singer in popular music.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Valo was ranked number 80 in Hit Paraders Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time.<ref></ref> Loudwire ranked him as the fourteenth greatest metal frontman of the 21st century, stating: "His baritone voice is undeniably gorgeous, his vampiric charisma is almost hypnotic, male fans desperately attempt to emulate him and female fans scream ballistically as if he was the second coming of Elvis."<ref name="Top30"></ref> In 2004 and 2005, Valo was awarded the Golden God Award and the Icon Award, respectively, at the Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards.<ref name="BraveWords"></ref><ref name="MHGoldenGods"></ref> In 2004, Kerrang! magazine named him the biggest sex symbol in the world, and in 2011, Valo was voted the "Hottest Dude In Hard Rock And Metal" by the readers of Revolver magazine.<ref name="ISKerrang"></ref><ref name="RevolverHot"></ref> In 2018, Valo was voted "Finland's Hottest Guy" in a poll by MTV.<ref name="MTVHot"></ref> Regarding these accolades, Valo has stated: "To be honest, I don't know what a sex symbol is. Compliments are nice, but I've always liked compliments on the music more."<ref name="MetalHammerPg20">Metal Hammer Presents HIM: Tears On Tape Fanpack Magazine - pg. 20</ref>
On his twentieth birthday, Valo created the heartagram, which would eventually become the symbol of HIM.<ref name="Wiki"/> A combination of a heart and a pentagram, the heartagram is meant to represent the juxtaposition of "the soft and the hard, the male and the female, the yin and the yang".<ref name="MetalHammerPg76">Metal Hammer Presents HIM: Tears On Tape Fanpack Magazine - pg. 76</ref><ref name="MetalHammerPg77">Metal Hammer Presents HIM: Tears On Tape Fanpack Magazine - pg. 77</ref> Musically the heart is meant to represent the softer side of the band, while the pentagram conveys the heavier elements of their sound.<ref name="MetalHammerPg77"/> Since its creation, Valo has stated that the heartagram "is probably the best thing he's ever come-up with", and that it's "worth a lot more than money" and "bigger than the band".<ref name="Wiki"/> He noted in 2016, "There are a lot of people who have Heartagram tattoos now. Kat Von D has one, Steve-O has a dickagram, which is like a Heartagram but ends with a dick. It's started to have a life of its own: there are a lot of people who have them who don't actually know what it was, don't relate it to the band, and in that sense, I consider that to be my greatest achievement. So it'll be nice to have it on my tombstone. And it'll be nice to see where it's going to go next."<ref name="louder"></ref>
