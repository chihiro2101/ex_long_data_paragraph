Oregon Country Fair

==History==
The first fair was held in Eugene over the weekend of November 1â€“2, 1969. It was promoted with the tagline, "come in costume".<ref name="Companion"></ref>
The fair began as a craft fair to raise funds for an alternative school, the Children's Community School.<ref name="Companion"/>
The event moved to its current location in Veneta, about 13 miles west of Eugene, for the fall fair in October, 1970, after having had a May Fair the same year on Crow Road about halfway between Eugene and Veneta.<ref name="Companion"/><ref name="OCFtimeline"></ref><ref name="ew2006"></ref>
In August 1972 and August 1982, OCF hosted concerts headlined by the Grateful Dead. Known as "Field Trips", the first concert was held as a benefit for the Springfield Creamery, which is owned by members of Ken Kesey's family.<ref></ref>
Until 1977, the fair was known as the Oregon Renaissance Faire.<ref> </ref>
The 52nd was deferred to 2021 as the COVID-19 pandemic was to blame for 2020's cancellation.

==Tickets and transportation==
Tickets and passes are required to attend the Oregon Country Fair. All tickets sold to the public are sold in advance at TicketsWest outlets and other retail centers throughout the Northwest.

==Culture==
The fair is a family event with face painting, puppet shows, and music for children. Toplessness is permitted while full nudity is not allowed during public hours in public areas.<ref></ref> No alcohol is allowed, and smoking is limited to designated areas. The fair has its own water and communications systems, recycling service, emergency medical team, traffic control, and security team. Since 1997 there has been a strong effort to make it a drug-free event.
==Infrastructure==
The fair is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. It is governed by an elected ten-member Board of Directors (with 2 elected alternates). There are seven staff positions within the organization. Staff positions traditionally include a General Manager, an Operations Manager, an Assistant Manager, A Site and Facilities Manager, a Residential Caretaker, a Groundskeeper, and an Administrative Assistant. Currently the fair does not have a General Manager. Until a full-time General Manager is hired by the Board of Directors, the Site and Facilities Manager and Operations Manager share management responsibilities and authority within the organization. 
Alter-abled access is available at the Oregon Country Fair, including wheelchairs (there is a battery re-charging station for electric wheelchairs), helpers, sign language interpreters, folding chairs, rest areas, maps, and other information. To obtain these services, or more information about them, event participants can go to the following locations on the event site: the Alter-Abled Access Advocates(4A)Center (located near Admissions as well as at the Bus Stop), Community Village, Solutions, and all Information booths.<ref name="oregoncountryfair.org"> urltoken

Publications
The Oregon Country Fair publishes a newsletter, the Fair Family News, eleven times a year. As well as an event paper, the Peach Pit, once a year for the three-day event.<ref name="oregoncountryfair.org"/>
==Volunteer crews==
The Oregon Country Fair has a large volunteer network. This volunteer network is the base for all operational needs of the event. While some working volunteers receive food vouchers, which can be used to buy meals from vendors during the event, many volunteers do not. Volunteer crews are separated into "Pre-fair Crews" and "During Fair Crews." Pre-fair crews work from the site's opening in early June until the event officially opens to the public on the second weekend in July. Pre-fair crews are responsible for setting up the site's physical infrastructure and preparing the site both for the festival and for the increase in people on the land with the aim of reducing impact and preserving natural flora and fauna. Preservation and restoration efforts are led by the Site and Facilities Manager year round, and are largely carried out by the Residential Caretaker with the help of a special crew known as Site Crew who report directly to the Caretaker and Site and Facilities Manager. <ref name="Oregon Country Fair"/>
All volunteers agree to the Oregon Country Fair Guidelines and Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct of The Oregon Country Fair is:
==History of the land==
The Willamette Valley has been continuously occupied by humans, to some extent, for at least the last 9,000-10,000 years (this timeline is based on the archaeological evidence gathered from 34 archaeological sites in the Upper Willamette Valley).<ref>A Chronology of Upper Willamette Valley, Oregon, Prehistory John R. White American Antiquity, Vol. 44, No. 3 (Jul., 1979), pp. 401-640</ref>

The Oregon Country Fair property includes archaeological sites protected by state law. It is thought to have previously been a gathering place for the Kalapuya tribe of Native Americans. All ground disturbing activities on the fair property must be approved by the archaeology and construction crews.<ref></ref>
The Kalapuya lived in permanent winter homes and migrated throughout the Willamette Valley of Oregon during the summers. Subsistence was based on fishing, hunting, and gathering wild plant foods.<ref>Thomas A. Green,. 2006. "THE POWERS THAT BE: SACRED TALES." In The Greenwood Library of American Folktales Volume 4: The Northwest The American Indian Experience.</ref>
Based on the translation of Kalapuya texts, strong historical aspects of the Kalapuya culture include: the dream, the dream spirit-power, death, wealth, prestige, sexual division of labor (men hunt, women gather), sex, acculturation, and language. The dream spirit-power was observed to be the strongest. The dream power was constantly referred to in matters of courage and bravery, of sickness and resisting disease, gambling, hunting, wealth, casting spells, power over natural phenomena and becoming a shaman.<ref>Ethnolinguistic Observations Based on Kalapuya Texts J. P. Rumberger, Jr.International Journal of American Linguistics, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Jul., 1949), pp. 139-19</ref>
Much of the fair site is a wetland and the Long Tom River floods much of the fair property each winter.<ref name=Mantia></ref>
==Educational areas==
Some of the Oregon Country Fair's areas are organized to be information and workshop resources.
The Kids Loop is a children's play area, Yes You Canopy is a pavilion dedicated to the teaching of juggling, Energy Park is an area with displays and demonstrations on alternative energy, alternative transportation, organic agriculture and recycling,<ref name=Educational></ref> and Community Village has booths from non-profit organizations dedicated to education, information access, plants and gardening, including a display by the Oregon State University/Lane County Extension Master Gardeners,<ref></ref> and other forms of progressive social change.
Archaeology Park ("Ark Park") is the home of the fair's archaeology crew, and includes replica cedar houses like those used by Pacific Northwest Native American tribes, displays of artifacts and photos of archaeological digs from the fair site, and hands-on demonstrations of Knapping, firemaking, basket weaving and other Native American skills.<ref></ref>
==Philanthropy==
The OCF organization maintains close ties with the Eugene-area community and supports many other nonprofit organizations through its philanthropic programs.
Fairgoers, fair working volunteers, and the OCF organization alike contribute to non-profit groups through The Jill Heiman Vision Fund. This fund grants funds to tax-exempt organizations in Lane County. Donations are provided to projects and programs related to improving the environment and fostering sustainability.
The OCF Board has created The Bill Wooten Endowment Fund to assist arts, environmental, and social justice projects. The Board of Directors also offers donations to various groups and activities that share its values of living artfully and authentically on the earth.<ref></ref>

The Oregon Country Fair begins on the Friday of the second weekend in July every year (i.e. as early as July 7 and as late as July 13). The fair is a non-profit organization and as such has a board of directors. Additionally, the management structure of the Oregon Country Fair is typically composed of a General Manager, an Operations Manager, and a team of volunteer Back Up Managers, otherwise known as BUMS, who serve as representation for the fair's paid management staff for the duration of the event. Currently the fair does not have an official General Manager. In the interim, management responsibilities fall to the Operations Manager and the Site Manager who work as a co-management team.
