Bachman's warbler

==Taxonomy==
This bird was first recorded in 1832 by the Reverend John Bachman, who found the species near Charleston, South Carolina, and presented study skins and descriptions to his friend and collaborator, John James Audubon.<ref name="Dunn121"></ref> Audubon never saw the bird alive but named it in honor of Bachman in 1833.<ref name="Dunn121"/>
Bachman's warbler does not have any extremely close relatives, though the blue-winged and the rapidly declining golden-winged warblers, also members of the genus Vermivora, are thought to be its closest relatives.<ref name="Dunn122"/> There were no known subspecies.<ref name="Dunn122"></ref>
==Description==
 
Bachman's warbler is a sexually dimorphic species and the adults have two distinct plumages, one for the spring and one for the fall.<ref name="Dunn123"></ref> In the spring, adult males have a yellow forehead, supraloral, and supercilium.<ref name="Dunn123"/> The area below the bird's eye is yellow, while the lores are a dusky olive.<ref name="Dunn123"/> The bird's forecrown is black with gray at the edges, while the rear crown and nape are olive-gray.<ref name="Dunn123"/> The rest of the bird's upperparts are an olive green, with the rump being the brightest.<ref name="Dunn123"/> The chin and upper throat are yellow, while the center throat and upper chest are black.<ref name="Dunn123"/> The belly is yellow, and the undertail coverts are white.<ref name="Dunn123"/> Males in their first spring are nearly identical to the adult male, but have less black on their crown and chest.<ref name="Dunn123"/>
During the spring, adult females are a light yellow in their forehead and supraloral, blending into the gray crown and nape.<ref name="Dunn123"/> Its lores are a gray-olive and it has a white eye ring.<ref name="Dunn123"/> The rest of the female's upperparts are an olive-green, which like the male is brightest on the rump.<ref name="Dunn123"/> The chin and throat are also a light yellow, while the sides of the neck and the upper breast are gray.<ref name="Dunn123"/> Older females have a few black upper breast feathers.<ref name="Dunn124"></ref> The rest of the breast and the belly is light yellow, blending into white on the undertail coverts.<ref name="Dunn123"/> The flanks are also washed with gray.<ref name="Dunn124"/> First spring females resemble the adult female, but appear duller.<ref name="Dunn124"/>
Bachman's warbler molts over the summer into its fall plumage.<ref name="Dunn124"/> For adult males, the fall plumage is nearly identical to the spring, with the only difference being that the forecrown changes from black to gray.<ref name="Dunn124"/> First year males also resemble their spring plumage, but have an olive forecrown and duller yellow underparts.<ref name="Dunn124"/> Adult females possess the same plumage, though it looks fresher in the fall, while first year females have an olive-yellow forehead and a dull eyering.<ref name="Dunn124"/>
Hatchlings obtain their first plumage in May and undergo their first molt in June.<ref name="Dunn124"/> Juvenile Bachman's warblers have a dusky brown head and upperparts and are a paler brown below, which transitions to dull white on the lower body and undertail.<ref name="Dunn124"/>
This warbler is in length.<ref name="Dunn117"></ref> It is relatively small for a warbler and has a short tail.<ref name="Dunn117"/> It is unique amongst warblers for its thin and decurved bill.<ref name="Dunn117"/> The bill of Bachman's warbler is blackish brown in adults and brown in the young.<ref name="Dunn124"/> The legs are a grayish-brown, while the eyes are dark brown.<ref name="Dunn124"/>
Documented examples of the species' songs were composed of a rapid series six to twenty-five buzz notes, sometimes ending in a sharp, slurred note zip.<ref name="Dunn118"></ref> The song was similar to that of the northern parula, but distinguishable in that it was noticeably monotone.<ref name="Dunn118"/> Multiple call notes have been recorded, ranging from a soft tsip to a low, hissing zee-e-eep.<ref name="Dunn118"/>
==Distribution and habitat==
Bachman's warbler breeds primarily in two distinct regions, namely the southern Atlantic coastal plain and the Gulf Coast states north along the Mississippi River watershed to Kentucky.<ref name="Dunn120"/> In the southern Atlantic coastal plain, the bird breeds in South Carolina near Charleston, though it is believed to have once bred as far north as Virginia and south into Georgia.<ref name="Dunn120"/> The Gulf Coast breeding habitat is located primarily in central Alabama, though reports from northern Mississippi and Louisiana are known.<ref name="Dunn120"/> It breeds north of Alabama along Arkansas's and Missouri's St. Francis River.<ref name="Dunn120"/> Unaccepted records of breeding in eastern Texas, Oklahoma, and Tennessee are known.<ref name="Dunn120"/> During migration, the species was primarily recorded in Florida and the Florida Keys, although a few birds migrated along the eastern Gulf Coast.<ref name="Dunn121"/> Additionally, there is one spring migration record from the Bahamas in 1901.<ref name="Dunn121"/> The species primarily winters in Cuba.<ref name="Dunn120"/> Additionally, it was recorded wintering on the Isle of Pines, and one wintering record is known from Florida.<ref name="Dunn120"/> Unconfirmed reports of the species wintering in Georgia's Okefenokee Swamp exist.<ref name="Dunn120"/>
Bachman's warbler breeds in timbered bottomland swamps with pools of still water.<ref name="Dunn119"/> These swampy forests are mainly composed of deciduous trees such as cypress, sweet gum, dogwood, red oak, hickory, black gum, and tupelo.<ref name="Dunn119"/> While it is not definitively known where in these swamps Bachman's warbler prefers, it is believed that they prefer small edges created by fire or storms with a dense understory of the cane species Arundinaria gigantea and Sabal.<ref name="Dunn119"/> Some believe that this species may have been a cane specialist.<ref name="Dunn120"></ref>
While migrating, the species still preferred bottomland forests, though it was reported in scrubby habitats when this was not available.<ref name="Dunn120"/> During the Cuban winter it seems to have broadened its habitat to include most forests, ranging from dry, semideciduous forests to urban parks to swamps.<ref name="Dunn120"/> Hibiscus forests may have been important.<ref name="Dunn120"/>
==Ecology and behavior==
 
Due to the rarity of this species, little is known of its behavior.<ref name="Dunn119"></ref> This species did not frequently pump its tail.<ref name="Dunn119"/> When alarmed, Bachman's warbler jerked its tail and raised its crown feathers.<ref name="Dunn119"/>
This species did not frequently sing while migrating, though it did sing upon reaching its breeding grounds.<ref name="Dunn119"/> Once there, it preferred to use high perches to sing from.<ref name="Dunn119"/> The female warbler incubates the eggs while the male looks for food.
This species's foraging niche was quite low in elevation, frequently between three and ten feet.<ref name="Dunn119"/> However, during migration it was also observed foraging in the tops of trees.<ref name="Dunn119"/> This bird could feed while hanging upside down to probe the bottoms of leaves.<ref name="Dunn119"/> Bachman's warbler fed by gleaning and probing into leaf clusters.<ref name="Dunn119"/> This latter foraging strategy led some to hypothesize that this warbler specialized in foraging among dead leaves in canebrakes.<ref name="Dunn119"/> Its primary prey included caterpillars, spiders, and other arthropods.<ref name="Dunn119"/> It may have fed on nectar in Cuba, but this hypothesis is unproven.<ref name="Dunn119"/>
It may be a colonial breeder.<ref name="Dunn120"/> The nests were deep and bulky.<ref name="Dunn119"/> Dead leaves, mosses, grasses, and weed stalks composed the exterior, while the interior cup was lined with fine fibers from Ramalina lichen and Spanish moss.<ref name="Dunn119"/> These nests were made amongst blackberry brambles, cane stalks, and Sabal in bottomland forests 1 to 4 feet above the ground or, frequently, pools of water.<ref name="Dunn119"/> Unusually for a warbler, its eggs were pure white with occasional fine marks at the large end.<ref name="Dunn119"/>
===Migration===
Bachman's warbler migrated quite early in comparison with other New World warblers.<ref name="Dunn121"/> Spring migration begins in late February and birds appear in south Florida and southeastern Louisiana by the first week of March.<ref name="Dunn121"/> Peak migration in south Florida was during the first three weeks of March and along the northwestern Florida coast during the third and fourth week of March.<ref name="Dunn121"/> The latest recorded Bachman's warbler in Florida was noted on April 9.<ref name="Dunn121"/> These warblers reached their South Carolina breeding grounds around mid-March, though some were known to arrive in late February.<ref name="Dunn121"/> Birds migrating to southeastern Missouri arrived between mid and late April.<ref name="Dunn121"/> Some birds overshot their breeding grounds and were found in Virginia and North Carolina.<ref name="Dunn121"/>
In South Carolina, all Bachman's warblers leave their breeding ground by July 19.<ref name="Dunn121"/> The peak of fall migration is poorly documented, but the earliest date for a migrant in southern Mississippi is July 4, while the first migrants at Key West were reported on July 17.<ref name="Dunn121"/> All migration was between the end of July and August 25, with the last reported migrating individual being a September 24 bird in coastal Georgia.<ref name="Dunn121"/>
==Conservation==
 
Bachman's warbler was originally collected by John Bachman in South Carolina in 1832 and described by Audubon in 1833<ref name="Dunn121"/> from skins mailed by Bachman. It remained largely unknown until the mid-1880s.<ref name="Dunn121"/> It is believed that selective logging in the 1800s briefly benefited the species by providing more habitat.<ref name="Dunn121"/> It was frequently seen in its breeding habitat from the mid-1880s to 1910.<ref name="Dunn121"/> However, when clear-cutting began replacing selective logging, sightings of this species grew scarce.<ref name="Dunn121"/> By the 1930s, sightings were rare, and in 1940 the last definite winter sighting was recorded.<ref name="Dunn122"/> The last male specimen was collected on March 21, 1941, on Deer Island, Mississippi, while the last female specimen was collected on February 28, 1940, on Ship Island, Mississippi.<ref name="Dunn122"/>
Reports of birds from the Missouri and Arkansas breeding grounds lasted through the 1940s, while birds were reported breeding in South Carolina's I'on Swamp until 1953.<ref name="Dunn122"/> Individuals were reported from Fairfax County, Virginia, in 1954 and 1958, and a male was seen singing near I'on Swamp in April 1962.<ref name="Dunn122"/> On March 30, 1977, an immature female was seen in Brevard County, Florida.<ref name="Dunn122"/> The last confirmed observation was in Louisiana in 1988.<ref name = "RecoveryPlan" /> Reliable reports of sightings of the species from the Congaree National Park in the early 2000s prompted formal investigation, but were attributed as misidentifications of hooded warbler sightings and northern parula songs. A thorough and systematic search using playback of recorded Bachman's warbler songs did not reveal any territorial males and did not provoke any aggressive response from other bird species, and the survey leaders concluded the species was not present in the park during their search.<ref></ref>
This species is threatened due to habitat destruction.<ref name="Dunn122"/> It is thought to have nested in canebrakes, the loss of which posed a threat, as did loss of wintering habitat in the Caribbean and plume hunting.<ref></ref> Small-scale logging in the 1800s may actually have increased Bachman warbler's breeding habitat.<ref name="Dunn120"/> Clearcutting of its habitat and the draining of swamps via water channels are the two main causes of habitat destruction.<ref name="Dunn122"/> While it is unknown whether habitat change in its wintering grounds of Cuba affected the species, it is believed that a winter hurricane in the 1930s could have been a crippling blow, making them too rare to find each other and mate.<ref name="Dunn122"/>
==In culture==
Audubon's folio renderings of a male and female Bachman's warbler were painted on top of an illustration of the Franklinia tree first painted by Maria Martin, Bachman's sister-in-law and one of the country's first female natural history illustrators.
In the comic strip Doonesbury, Dick Davenport, a Birdwatching, died in 1986 of a massive coronary while observing and photographing this species. This death scene has been noted as a particularly memorable one in the history of comics.<ref></ref>

Bachman's warbler (Vermivora bachmanii) is a small passerine migratory bird that is critically endangered or extinct. This warbler was a migrant, breeding in swampy blackberry and cane thickets of the southeast United States and wintering in Cuba. There are some reports of the bird from the twenty-first century, but none are widely accepted. Some authorities accept a sighting in Louisiana, in August 1988 as confirmed,<ref name = "RecoveryPlan"></ref> but the last uncontroversial sightings date to the 1960s.
