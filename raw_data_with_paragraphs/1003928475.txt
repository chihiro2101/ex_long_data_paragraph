Sourdough

===Baking===
The starter must be fed 4 to 12 hours prior to being added to dough, by mixing flour and water to the starter. This creates an active leaven, which should grow in size and is ready to use when it is bubbly and floats in water. The leaven is mixed with flour and water to make a final dough of the desired consistency. The starter weight is usually 13% to 25% of the total flour weight, though formulas may vary.<ref name="pain au levain"></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> The dough is shaped into loaves, left to rise, and then baked. A number of 'no knead' methods are available for sourdough bread. Due to the length of time sourdough bread takes to proof, many bakers may refrigerate their loaves prior to baking. This process is known as 'retardation' to slow down the proofing process. This process has the added benefit of developing a richer flavoured bread.
Because the rise time of most sourdough starters is longer than that of breads made with baker's yeasts, sourdough starters are generally unsuitable for use in a bread machine. However, sourdough that has been proved over many hours, using a sourdough starter or mother dough, can then be transferred to the machine, utilizing only the baking segment of the bread-making program, bypassing timed mechanical kneading by the machine's paddle. This may be convenient for single loaf production, but the complex blistered and slashed crust characteristics of oven-baked sourdough bread cannot be achieved in a bread making machine, as this usually requires the use of a baking stone in the oven and misting of the dough to produce steam. Furthermore, ideal crust development requires loaves of shapes not achievable in a machine's loaf tin.
==Biology and chemistry of sourdough==
Sourdough is a stable culture of lactic acid bacteria and yeast in a mixture of flour and water. Broadly speaking, the yeast produces gas (carbon dioxide) which leavens the dough, and the lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, which contributes flavor in the form of sourness. The lactic acid bacteria metabolize sugars that the yeast cannot, while the yeast metabolizes the by-products of lactic acid fermentation.<ref name=":2"></ref><ref></ref> During sourdough fermentation, many cereal enzymes, particularly phytases, proteases and pentosanases, are activated through acidification and contribute to biochemical changes during sourdough fermentation.<ref name=":0" />
===Lactic acid bacteria===
Lactic acid bacteria are Anaerobic organism, which means that though they are anaerobes, they can multiply in the presence of oxygen.
Major lactic acid bacteria in sourdough are heterofermentative organisms and convert hexoses by the Phosphoketolase pathway to lactate, CO<sub>2</sub> and acetate or ethanol; <ref name=":2" /> heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria are usually associated with homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly Lactobacillus and Companilactobacillus species.
===Yeasts===
The most common yeast species in sourdough are Kazachstania exigua, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, K. exiguus and K. humilis (previously Candida milleri or Candida humilis).<ref></ref><ref name="fermented.bread"></ref>
===Type I sourdough===
Traditional sourdoughs used as sole leavening agent are referred to as Type I sourdough, examples include sourdoughs used for San Francisco Sourdough Bread, Panettone, and rye bread.<ref name="p179isbn0-387-23180-3"></ref> Type I sourdoughs are generally firm doughs,<ref name="fermented.bread" /> have a pH range of 3.8 to 4.5, and are fermented in a temperature range of . Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis was named for its discovery in San Francisco sourdough starters, though it is not endemic to San Francisco. F sanfranciscensis and Limosilactobacillus pontis often highlight a lactic-acid bacterial flora that includes Limosilactobacillus fermentum, Fructilactobacillus fructivorans, Levilactobacillus brevis, and Companilactobacillus paralimentarius.<ref name="pmid12450829"></ref><ref name="p179isbn0-387-23180-3" /><ref name="pmid17008161"></ref><ref name=":1" /> The yeasts Saccharomyces exiguus, Kasachstania humilis, or Candida holmii<ref name="p179isbn0-387-23180-3" /> usually populate sourdough cultures symbiotically with Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis.<ref name="modeling.growth"></ref> The perfect yeast S. exiguus is related to the imperfect yeasts C. milleri and C. holmii. Torulopsis holmii, Torula holmii, and S. rosei are synonyms used prior to 1978. C. milleri and C. holmii are physiologically similar, but DNA testing established them as distinct. Other yeasts reported found include C. humilis, C. krusei, Pichia anomaola, C. peliculosa, P. membranifaciens, and C. valida.<ref name="0-8493-9849-5"> See Table 183.6</ref><ref name="1-4020-8291-6"></ref> There have been changes in the taxonomy of yeasts in recent decades.<ref name="0-8493-9849-5"/><ref name="1-4020-8291-6" /> F. sanfranciscensis requires maltose,<ref name=Neubauer_1994></ref> while C. milleri is maltase negative and thus cannot consume maltose.<ref name="Decock.Cappele"></ref><ref name="maltose.glucose.lactobacilli"></ref><ref name="Sugihara.Kline.Miller"></ref><ref name="Kline.Sugihara.San_Francisco."></ref><ref name="Daeschel.Andersson.Fleming"></ref> C. milleri can grow under conditions of low pH and relatively high acetate levels, a factor contributing to sourdough flora's stability.<ref name="0-8247-4264-8"></ref>
In order to produce acetic acid, F. sanfrancisensis needs maltose and fructose.<ref></ref> Wheat dough contains abundant starch and some Sinistrines, which enzymes degrade to "maltose, fructose and little glucose."<ref></ref> The terms "fructosan, glucofructan, sucrosyl fructan, polyfructan, and polyfructosan" are all used to describe a class of compounds that are "structurally and metabolically" related to sucrose, where "carbon is stored as sucrose and polymers of fructose (fructans)."<ref></ref> Yeasts have the ability to free fructose from glucofructans which compose about 1–2% of the dough. Glucofructans are long strings of fructose molecules attached to a single glucose molecule. Sucrose can be considered the shortest glucofructan, with only a single fructose molecule attached.<ref name="0-8247-4264-8" /> When L. sanfrancisensis reduces all available fructose, it stops producing acetic acid and begins producing ethanol. If the fermenting dough gets too warm, the yeasts slow down, producing less fructose. Fructose depletion is more of a concern in doughs with lower enzymatic activities.<ref name="d.wing" />
A Belgian study of wheat and spelt doughs refreshed once every 24 hours and fermented at in a laboratory environment provides insight into the three-phase evolution of first-generation-to-stable sourdough ecosystems. In the first two days of refreshment, atypical genera Enterococcus and Lactococcus bacteria highlighted the doughs. During days 2–5, sourdough-specific bacteria belonging to the genera Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, and Weissella outcompete earlier strains. Yeasts grew more slowly and reached population peaks near days 4–5. By days 5–7, "well-adapted" Lactobacillus strains such as L. fermentum and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum had emerged. At their peaks, yeast populations were in the range of about 1–10% of the lactobacilli populations or 1:10–1:100. One characteristic of a stable dough is that the heterofermentative have outcompeted homofermentative lactobacilli.<ref name="Scheirlinck.Schoor.population.dynamics"></ref> F. sanfranciscensis has typically not been identified in spontaneous sourdoughs, even after multiple cycles of back-slopping; it was rapidly introduced in wheat sourdoughs, however, when plant materials were used to start the fermentation. <ref></ref>
Investigations of wheat sourdough found that S. cerevisiae died off after two refreshment cycles.<ref name="0-8247-4264-8" /> S. cerevisiae has less tolerance to acetic acid than other sourdough yeasts.<ref name="0-8493-9849-5" /> Continuously maintained, stable sourdough cannot be unintentionally contaminated by S. cerevisiae.<ref name="daniel.wing.michael.ganzle.correspondence"></ref>
===Type II sourdough===
In Type II sourdoughs, baker's yeast or Saccharomyces cerevisiae<ref></ref> is added to leaven the dough; L. pontis and Limosilactobacillus panis in association with Lactobacillus species are dominant members of type II sourdoughs.<ref name="fermented.bread" /><ref name="p179isbn0-387-23180-3" /><ref name="pmid17008161" /><ref name=":1" /> They have a pH less than 3.5, and are fermented within a temperature range of for several days without feedings, which reduces the flora's activity.<ref></ref> This process was adopted by some in industry, in part, due to simplification of the multiple-step build typical of Type I sourdoughs.<ref></ref>
In Type II sourdoughs, yeast growth is slowed or stopped due to higher fermentation temperatures. These doughs are more liquid and once fermented may be chilled and stored for up to a week. They are pumpable and used in continuous bread production systems.<ref name="fermented.bread" />
===Type III sourdough===
Type III sourdoughs are Type II sourdoughs subjected to a drying process, usually either spray or drum drying, and are mainly used at an industrial level as flavoring agents. They are dominated by "drying-resistant lactic acid bacteria such as Pediococcus pentosaceus, L. plantarum, and L. brevis." The drying conditions, time and heat applied, may be varied in order to influence caramelize and produce desired characteristics in the baked product.<ref name="fermented.bread" />
==Types of bread==
There are many breads that use techniques similar to that used in the making of sourdough bread. Danish rugbrød (rye bread) is a dense, dark bread best known from its use in the Danish smørrebrød (open-faced sandwiches).<ref></ref><ref></ref> The Mexican birote salado started out in the city of Guadalajara as a short French baguette that replaces the yeast with a sourdough fermentation process, yielding a bread that is crunchy outside but soft and savory inside.<ref></ref> Amish friendship bread uses a sourdough starter that includes sugar and milk. It is also leavened with baking powder and baking soda. An Amish sourdough is fed with sugar and potato flakes every 3–5 days. German pumpernickel is traditionally made from a sourdough starter,<ref></ref> although modern pumpernickel loaves often use commercial yeasts, sometimes spiked with citric acid or lactic acid to inactivate the amylases in the rye flour. Flemish desem bread (the word means 'starter') is a whole-wheat sourdough.<ref></ref> In Azerbaijan, whole-wheat sourdough flatbreads are traditionally eaten.<ref></ref> In Ethiopia, teff flour is fermented to make injera.<ref></ref> A similar variant is eaten in Somalia, Djibouti, and Yemen (where it is known as lahoh).<ref></ref> In India, idlis and dosa are made from a sourdough fermentation of rice and Vigna mungo.<ref></ref>
==Qualities affecting health==
Sourdough fermentation and lactic acid bacteria may be useful to improve the quality of gluten-free breads, such as by enhancing texture, aroma, and shelf life, which can be extended by inhibition of mycotoxins associated with fungus.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
Sourdough bread has a relatively low glycemic index compared with other types of bread.<ref name="StamatakiYanni2017"></ref><ref name="Nutr"></ref> <ref name=":3"></ref> The activity of cereal enzymes during sourdough fermentation hydrolyses phytates, which affect the absorption of some dietary minerals.<ref name=":3" /> Sourdough bread made from whole grains was recommended as a key daily food in the Italian Mediterranean diet.<ref name=Nutr/>
Sourdough fermentation also reduces fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) as well as the amylase trypsin inhibitor (ATI), wheat components that are thought to contribute to non-celiac wheat sensitivity and irritable bowel syndrome, and increases the concentration or bio-availability of bioactive compounds, particularly phenolic compounds. <ref name=":3" /><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>

"mother sponge", "chef", or "seed sour") rather than making a new starter every time they bake. The original starter culture may be many years old. Because of their pH level and the presence of antibacterial agents, such cultures are stable and able to prevent colonization by unwanted yeasts and bacteria. For this reason, sourdough products inherently keep fresh for a longer time than other breads, and are good at resisting spoilage and mold without the additives required to retard spoiling of other types of bread.<ref> urltoken 
The flavour of sourdough bread varies from place to place according to the method used, the hydration of the starter and the final dough, the refreshment ratio, the length of the fermentation periods, ambient temperature, humidity, and elevation, all of which contribute to the microbiology of the sourdough.
