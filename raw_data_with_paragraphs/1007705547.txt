Nielsen ratings

==Measuring ratings==
The original data collection methods used to generate Nielsen TV ratings included:
# Paper "viewer diaries," in which a household recruited by the company self-recorded its viewing or listening habits. By targeting various demographics, the assembled statistical models provided a rendering of the audiences of any given show, network, and programming hour. The company phased out this methodology as electronic data collection became more sophisticated, and it was discontinued completely in June 2018.<ref></ref>
# Set Meters, which are small devices connected to televisions in recruited homes. These devices gather the viewing habits of the home and transmit the information nightly to Nielsen through a telephone line. This system is designed to allow market researchers to study television viewing habits on a minute-to-minute basis, recording the moment viewers change channels or turn off their television sets. Nielsen replaced the set meters with Portable People Meters (PPM), which collects the data of individual household members through the use of separate login credentials and allows the company to separate household viewing information into various demographic groups.
Changing systems of viewing have impacted Nielsen's methods of market research. In 2005, Nielsen began measuring the usage of digital video recorder such as TiVos. Initial results indicated that time-shifted viewing (i.e., programs that are watched after the networks have aired them) would significantly impact television ratings. A year later, the networks were not factoring these new results into their ad rates because of advertisers' resistance.<ref></ref>
In July 2017, Nielsen announced that it would include select programs from subscription-based video on demand (vSVOD) services Hulu and YouTube TV in its Digital in TV Ratings system.<ref></ref> Since about October 2017, Nielsen also began to track select programs from Netflix. Partnering distributors insert a "tag" into the program to be distributed on these services, which Nielsen then tracks through its meters system. Partnering distributors are able to determine if these ratings can be released publicly or not.<ref></ref>
===Ratings/share and total viewers===
The most commonly cited Nielsen results are reported in two measurements: ratings points and share, usually reported as: "ratings points/share". There were 119.6&nbsp;million TV homes in the U.S. for the 2017–18 TV season (Nielsen's National Television Household Universe Estimates).<ref></ref> The number of persons age 2 and older in U.S. TV households is estimated to be 304.5&nbsp;million. A single national ratings point represents 1% of the total number. Nielsen re-estimates the number of television-equipped households each August for the upcoming television season.<ref></ref>
A rating is a percentage of the group. It is basically calculated at RTG = HUT x SHARE where HUT (or PUT when measuring demos) is Homes Using Television and share is the percentage of TV sets used, which are tuned to a particular show. Share is NOT the percentage of television sets in use.
Share is the percentage of television sets in use, Households Using Television (HUT) or Persons Using Television (PUT) who are tuned to a specific program, station or network in a specific area at a specific time.<ref></ref><ref></ref> For example, Nielsen may report a show as receiving a 4.4/8 during its broadcast; this would mean that 4.4% of all television-equipped households (that is to say homes with a TV set, not total number of people), regardless of the TV being on or not, were tuned in to that program, while 8% of households that were watching TV at that time were watching the specific program.<ref></ref>
Because ratings are based on samples, it is possible for shows to get a 0.0 rating, despite having an audience; the CNBC talk show McEnroe was one notable example.<ref></ref> Another example is The CW show, CW Now, which received two 0.0 ratings in the same season. In 2014, Nielsen reported that American viewership of live television (totaling on average four hours and 32 minutes per day) had dropped 12 minutes per day compared to the year before. The CW got another 0.0 rating for its broadcast of the 1st Critics Choice Super Awards. Nielsen reported several reasons for the shift away from live television: increased viewership of time-shifted television (mainly through DVRs) and viewership of internet video (clips from video sharing websites and streams of full-length television shows).<ref></ref>
===Demographics===
Nielsen Media Research also provides statistics on specific demographics as such factors influence advertising rates as age, gender, race, economic class, and area. Younger viewers are considered more attractive for many products, whereas older and wealthier audiences are desired, or female audiences are desired over males.
In general, the number of viewers within the Key demographic is more important than the total number of viewers.<ref name=demos></ref><ref name=nyt></ref> According to Advertising Age, during the 2007–08 season, ABC was able to charge $419,000 per commercial sold during its medical drama Grey's Anatomy, compared to only $248,000 for a commercial during CBS' CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, despite CSI having almost five million more viewers on average.<ref name=demos2></ref> Because of its strength in young "demos" (demographic groups), NBC was able to charge almost three times as much for a commercial during Friends as CBS charged for Murder, She Wrote, even though the two series had a similar amount of total viewership during the two seasons they were on the air concurrently.<ref name=demos/> Glee (on Fox) and The Office (on NBC) drew fewer total viewers than NCIS (on CBS) during the 2009–10 season, but earned an average of $272,694 and $213,617 respectively, compared to $150,708 for NCIS.<ref name=estadrates></ref>
===Commercial ratings===
Nielsen also provides viewership data calculated as the average viewership for only the commercial time within the program. These "Commercial Ratings" first became available on May 31, 2007. Additionally, Nielsen provides different "streams" of this data in order to take into consideration delayed viewing (DVR) data, at any interval up to seven days.<ref></ref> C3 was the metric launched in 2007, and refers to the ratings for average commercial minutes in live programming plus total playback by digital video recorder out to three days after.<ref></ref> By the end of 2012, some television executives wanted to see C7, ratings for live plus seven days, with CBS Corporation chief executive officer Les Moonves making the claim C7 made ratings increase by 30%.<ref></ref>
===Sweeps===
The American television measurement by Nielsen is based on three different methodological approaches. In the 25 TV markets with the highest sales (e., g. New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver), the Local People Meter (LPM) is measured. Individuals register individually; the measurement is carried out on 365 days over 24 hours.<ref name=locmeas></ref> The SET Meter (Diary & Electronic) is used in 31 smaller markets (such as Nashville, Salt Lake City). In four sweeps in February, May, July, and November, target group data are collected with the diary and validated with the data of the devices (TV set on/off) in the participating households.<ref name=locmeas /> In the 154 TV markets with the lowest sales (e. g. Harrisburg, PA or Honolulu) the use of TV is only recorded using a diary survey.
Each year, Nielsen processes approximately two million paper diaries from households across the country,<ref></ref> for November, February, May, and July—also known as the "sweeps" rating periods.<ref name=bn8614></ref> The term "sweeps" dates from 1954, when Nielsen collected diaries from households in the Eastern United States first; from there they would "sweep" west.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Seven-day diaries (or eight-day diaries in homes with DVRs) are mailed to homes to keep a tally of what is watched on each television set and by whom. Over the course of a sweeps period, diaries are mailed to a new panel of homes each week. At the end of the month, all of the viewing data from the individual weeks is aggregated. One exception to the normal sweeps periods occurred in 2008–09 when the February sweeps period was moved to March to accommodate the digital television transition, which was scheduled to take place on February 17, 2009. The transition date was moved to June 12, but Nielsen stayed with the March sweeps period.
This local viewing information provides a basis for program scheduling and advertising decisions for local television stations, cable systems, and advertisers. Typically, the November, February and May sweeps are considered more important; nevertheless, the July sweeps can have a local impact regarding personnel.<ref name=bn8614/>
In some mid-size markets, diaries provide viewer information for up to two additional "sweeps" months (October and January).

Nielsen TV ratings (commonly referred to as Nielsen ratings) are the audience measurement systems operated by Nielsen Media Research that seek to determine the audience size and composition of broadcast programming in the United States using a rating system.
Nielsen Media Research was founded by Arthur Nielsen, a market analyst who started his career in the 1920s with marketing research and performance analysis. The company expanded into radio market analysis in the late 1930s, culminating in the Nielsen Radio Index in 1942,<ref name="NRhx"></ref> which was meant to provide statistics as to the markets of radio shows. The first Nielsen ratings for radio programs were released the first week of December 1947. They measured the top 20 programs in four areas: total audience, average audience, cumulative audience, and homes per dollar spent for time and talent.<ref></ref>
In 1950, Nielsen moved to television, developing a rating system using the methods he and his company had developed for radio. That method became the primary source of audience measurement information in the US television industry. In September 2020, Nielsen started compiling a weekly Top 10 list of most-watched shows on streaming platforms.
