Hacker culture

==Definition==
The term hacker was first coined in the fourteenth century, as a term for someone who did not have a lot of knowledge in something.<ref></ref> The Jargon File, an influential but not universally accepted compendium of hacker slang, defines hacker as "A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and stretching their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary."<ref name="J_F_hacker"></ref> The Request for Comments (RFC) 1392, the Internet Users' Glossary, amplifies this meaning as "A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular."<ref> urltoken Internet Users' Glossary (Request for Comments 1392), January 1993</ref>
The media started using the word "hacker" heavily when Google Maps was released to the public in 2005. People would mess with Google's code to add whatever they wanted to the map, which caught wind with the media and hackers began to have a negative connotation.<ref></ref>
== Hacker vs. Cracker ==
Some common nicknames among this culture include "crackers" who are unskilled thieves who mainly rely on luck. Others include "phreak"which refers to a type of skilled crackers and "warez d00dz"which is a kind of cracker that acquires reproductions of copyrighted software. Furthermore, there are other hackers who are hired to test security, they are called "pentesters" or "tiger teams".
Hackers from this subculture tend to emphatically differentiate themselves from what they pejoratively call "crackers"; those who are generally referred to by media and members of the general public using the term "hacker", and whose primary focusbe it to malign or for malevolent purposeslies in exploiting weaknesses in computer security.<ref name="ESR_howto" />
As documented in the Jargon File, these hackers are disappointed by the mass media and general public's usage of the word hacker to refer to security breakers, calling them "crackers" instead. This includes both "good" crackers ("white hat hackers") who use their computer security related skills and knowledge to learn more about how systems and networks work and to help to discover and fix security holes, as well as those more "evil" crackers ("black hat hackers") who use the same skills to author harmful software (like viruses, trojans, etc.) and illegally infiltrate secure systems with the intention of doing harm to the system.<ref name="jargoncracker"> urltoken Definition of "Cracker" in the Jargon File</ref> The programmer subculture of hackers, in contrast to the cracker community, generally sees computer security related activities as contrary to the ideals of the original and true meaning of the hacker term that instead related to playful cleverness.<ref name="jargoncracker" />
The dictionary still defines a hacker as someone who illegally obtains access to some form of digital information.<ref></ref> But this culture would argue that there is a clear difference between hackers and crackers.
==History==
The word "hacker" derives from the seventeenth-century word of a "lusty laborer" who harvested fields by dogged and rough swings of his hoe. Although the idea of "hacking" has existed long before the term "hacker"with the most notable example of George Ellsworth, it was not a word that the first programmers used to describe themselves. In fact, many of the first programmers were from engineering or physics backgrounds. 
There was a growing awareness of a style of programming different from the cut and dried methods employed at first,<ref></ref><ref>
A successful software and hardware hacker artist is Mark Lottor (mkl), who has created the 3-D light art projects entitled the Cubatron, and the Big Round Cubatron. This art is made using custom computer technology, with specially designed circuit boards and programming for microprocessor chips to manipulate the LED lights.
Don Hopkins is a software hacker artist well known for his artistic cellular automata. This art, created by a cellular automata computer program, generates objects which randomly bump into each other and in turn create more objects and designs, similar to a lava lamp, except that the parts change color and form through interaction. Hopkins Says: 
Some hacker artists create art by writing computer code, and others, by developing hardware. Some create with existing software tools such as Adobe Photoshop or GIMP.
The creative process of hacker artists can be more abstract than artists using non-technological media. For example, mathematicians have produced visually stunning graphic presentations of fractals, which hackers have further enhanced, often producing detailed and intricate graphics and animations from simple mathematical formulas.

The hacker culture is a subculture of individuals who enjoy the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations of software systems to achieve novel and clever outcomes.<ref name="Gehring 2004 43"></ref> The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media<ref name=rms_hack> urltoken The Hacker Community and Ethics: An Interview with Richard M. Stallman, 2002 (gnu.org)</ref>) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed "hacking". However, the defining characteristic of a hacker is not the activities performed themselves (e.g. programming), but the manner in which it is done<ref name=on_hacking></ref> and whether it is something exciting and meaningful.<ref name=rms_hack /> This culture began back in the 1960s at MIT, where students banded together to release information on the internet they thought should be public information. Often referred to as, "computer-science freaks."<ref></ref> 
Richard Stallman explains about hackers who program:
People in hacker culture have a unique desire to practice their skills while simultaneously trying to have fun like children.<ref></ref>
