Common blackbird

===Feeding===
The common blackbird is omnivorous, eating a wide range of insects, earthworms, seeds and berries. It feeds mainly on the ground, running and hopping with a start-stop-start progress. It pulls earthworms from the soil, usually finding them by sight, but sometimes by hearing, and roots through leaf litter for other invertebrates. Small amphibians and lizards are occasionally hunted. This species will also perch in bushes to take berries and collect caterpillars and other active insects.<ref name= Snow/> Animal prey predominates, and is particularly important during the breeding season, with windfall apples and berries taken more in the autumn and winter. The nature of the fruit taken depends on what is locally available, and frequently includes exotics in gardens.
===Natural threats===
Near human habitation the main predator of the common blackbird is the domestic cat, with newly fledged young especially vulnerable. Foxes and predatory birds, such as the sparrowhawk and other accipiters, also take this species when the opportunity arises.<ref name=RSPB/><ref name=Lambeth></ref> However, there is little direct evidence to show that either predation of the adult blackbirds or loss of the eggs and chicks to corvids, such as the European magpie or Eurasian jay, decrease population numbers.<ref name=NatEngland></ref>
This species is occasionally a host of parasitic cuckoos, such as the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus), but this is minimal because the common blackbird recognizes the adult of the parasitic species and its mimicry eggs.<ref name = daviesnb></ref> In the UK, only three nests of 59,770 examined (0.005%) contained cuckoo eggs.<ref name= glue></ref> The introduced merula blackbird in New Zealand, where the cuckoo does not occur, has, over the past 130 years, lost the ability to recognize the adult common cuckoo but still rejects non-mimetic eggs.<ref name=JAB></ref>
As with other passerine birds, parasites are common. Intestinal parasites were found in 88% of common blackbirds, most frequently Isospora and Capillaria species.<ref></ref> and more than 80% had haematozoan parasites (Leucocytozoon, Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma species).<ref></ref>
Common blackbirds spend much of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird.<ref name= Gregoire/> In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested.<ref name= Gregoire/> This is partly because it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous.<ref name= Gregoire/> Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds,<ref name= Kipp></ref> there is no evidence that this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.<ref name=Gregoire></ref>
The common blackbird is one of a number of species which has unihemispheric slow-wave sleep. One hemisphere of the brain is effectively asleep, while a low-voltage EEG, characteristic of wakefulness, is present in the other. The benefit of this is that the bird can rest in areas of high predation or during long migratory flights, but still retain a degree of alertness.<ref name="Perspectives"></ref>

==Status and conservation==
The common blackbird has an extensive range, estimated at 10&nbsp;million&nbsp;square kilometres (3.8&nbsp;million square miles), and a large population, including an estimated 79 to 160 million individuals in Europe alone. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as least concern.<ref name=IUCN></ref> In the western Palearctic, populations are generally stable or increasing,<ref name=BWP> p1215–1218</ref> but there have been local declines, especially on farmland, which may be due to agricultural policies that encouraged farmers to remove hedgerows (which provide nesting places), and to drain damp grassland and increase the use of pesticides, both of which could have reduced the availability of invertebrate food.<ref name = RSPB></ref>
The common blackbird was introduced to Australia by a bird dealer visiting Melbourne in early 1857,<ref name=OzPests/> and its range has expanded from its initial foothold in Melbourne and Adelaide to include all of southeastern Australia, including Tasmania and the Bass Strait islands.<ref name =backyard></ref> The introduced population in Australia is considered a pest because it damages a variety of soft fruits in orchards, parks and gardens, including berries, cherries, stone fruit and grapes.<ref name="OzPests">Clarke, G. M.; Gross, S., Matthews, M.; Catling, P. C.; Baker, B.; Hewitt, C. L.; Crowther, D.; Saddler, S. R. (2000), Environmental Pest Species in Australia, Australia: State of the Environment, Second Technical Paper Series (Biodiversity), Department of the Environment and Heritage, Canberra.</ref> It is thought to spread weeds, such as blackberry, and may compete with native birds for food and nesting sites.<ref name=OzPests/><ref name=Oz></ref>
The introduced common blackbird is, together with the native silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), the most widely distributed avian seed disperser in New Zealand. Introduced there along with the song thrush (Turdus philomelos) in 1862, it has spread throughout the country up to an elevation of , as well as outlying islands such as the Campbell and Kermadecs.<ref name = "Fallaetal79">Falla, R. A., R. B. Sibson, and E. G. Turbott (1979). The new guide to the birds of New Zealand and outlying islands. Collins, Auckland. </ref> It eats a wide range of native and exotic fruit, and makes a major contribution to the development of communities of naturalised woody weeds. These communities provide fruit more suited to non-endemic native birds and naturalised birds than to endemic birds.<ref name= NZ></ref>
==In popular culture==
The common blackbird was seen as a sacred though destructive bird in Classical Greek folklore, and was said to die if it consumed pomegranates.<ref name = "Cooper92"></ref> Like many other small birds, it has in the past been trapped in rural areas at its night roosts as an easily available addition to the diet,<ref name=Cocker/> and in medieval times the practice of placing live birds under a pie crust just before serving may have been the origin of the familiar nursery rhyme:<ref name= Cocker ></ref>
<blockquote>
Sing a song of sixpence,<br />
A pocket full of rye;<br />
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie!<br />
When the pie was opened the birds began to sing,<br />
Oh, wasn't that a dainty dish to set before the king?<ref name = pie></ref></blockquote>
The common blackbird's melodious, distinctive song is mentioned in the poem Adlestrop by Edward Thomas;
<blockquote>And for that minute a blackbird sang<br />
Close by, and round him, mistier, <br />
Farther and farther, all the birds <br />
Of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire.<ref name = adelstrop></ref></blockquote>
In the English Christmas carol "The Twelve Days of Christmas", the line commonly sung today as "four calling birds" is believed to have originally been written in the 18th century as "four colly birds", an archaism meaning "black as coal" that was a popular English nickname for the common blackbird.<ref></ref>
The common blackbird, unlike many black creatures, is not normally seen as a symbol of bad luck,<ref name=Cocker/> but R. S. Thomas wrote that there is "a suggestion of dark Places about it",<ref name = rst></ref> and it symbolised resignation in the 17th century tragic play The Duchess of Malfi;<ref name="deVries76"></ref> an alternate connotation is vigilance, the bird's clear cry warning of danger.<ref name="deVries76"/>
The common blackbird is the national bird of Sweden,<ref name = sweden></ref> which has a breeding population of 1–2 million pairs,<ref name=BWP/> and was featured on a 30&nbsp;öre Christmas postage stamp in 1970;<ref name = stamp></ref> it has also featured on a number of other stamps issued by European and Asian countries, including a 1966 4d British stamp and a 1998 Irish 30p stamp.<ref></ref> This bird—arguably—also gives rise to the Serbian name for Kosovo (and Metohija), which is the possessive adjectival form of Serbian kos ("blackbird") as in Kosovo Polje ("Blackbird Field").<ref name= kosovo></ref>
A common blackbird can be heard singing on the Beatles song "Blackbird".<ref></ref>
A blackbird can also be heard along with a woodpigeon on the Kate Bush song "Aerial Tal".

In its native Northern Hemisphere range, the first-year male common blackbird of the nominate race may start singing as early as late January in fine weather in order to establish a territory, followed in late March by the adult male. The male's song is a varied and melodious low-pitched fluted warble, given from trees, rooftops or other elevated perches mainly in the period from March to June, sometimes into the beginning of July. It has a number of other calls, including an aggressive seee, a pook-pook-pook alarm for terrestrial predators like cats, and various chink and chook, chook vocalisations. The territorial male invariably gives chink-chink calls in the evening in an (usually unsuccessful) attempt to deter other blackbirds from roosting in its territory overnight.<ref name=Snow/> During the northern winter, blackbirds can be heard quietly singing to themselves, so much so that September and October are the only months in which the song cannot be heard.<ref name=gbirds></ref> Like other passerine birds, it has a thin high seee alarm call for threats from bird of prey since the sound is rapidly attenuated in vegetation, making the source difficult to locate.<ref name= burton></ref>
At least two subspecies, T. m. merula and T. m. nigropileus, will mimic other species of birds, cats, humans or alarms, but this is usually quiet and hard to detect.
