America's Promise

==History==
The Presidents’ Summit for America’s Future in 1997 – a national summit held in Philadelphia to promote a civic response to many of the country’s problems, particularly the challenges facing at-risk youth<ref> urltoken CNN, Clinton kicks off volunteer summit, April 27, 1997</ref> – led to the creation of America’s Promise Alliance.
Presidents Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush convened the summit, and Gen. Colin L. Powell, USA (Ret) served as the event’s general chairman. Focusing specifically on helping the nation’s young people, Gen. Powell agreed to lead a three-year campaign called America’s Promise – The Alliance for Youth, which set out to improve the lives of 2 million of the nation’s 15 million at-risk youth by 2000.<ref> urltoken CNN, Clinton kicks off volunteer summit, April 27, 1997</ref><ref> urltoken Sun Sentinel, Volunteer Recruitment Falls Short But Powell Effort Deserves Respect, May 3, 1998</ref>
In 2000, the target end-date of the campaign, General Powell determined that America’s Promise should continue its work and continue to operate as a nonprofit organization. Ending the work now, he said, would be “kind of like saying we'll be out of Bosnia in a year."<ref> urltoken Education Week, After 3 Years, "America's Promise" Continues, April 26, 2000</ref>
Early in its history, America’s Promise drew criticism for not being able to prove it had achieved its goals.<ref> urltoken New York Times, Charity Led by General Powell Comes Under Heavy Fire, Accused of Inflating Results, October 8, 1999</ref> A later analysis from the National 4-H Council, the nation’s largest youth development organization, agreed that while the organization’s impact was difficult to document, “much of the increased focus on youth and positive youth development…can be attributed to the visibility, energy, and funding America’s Promise brought to youth work.”<ref> urltoken Floyd, D. and Sauer, R.(n.d.), America’s Promise: A Catalyst for Youth Issues, University of Minnesota Digital Conservancy</ref>
In the years since, the work of America’s Promise has grown to encompass awareness building (see GradNation campaign below), academic research (see Center for Promise), cross-sector collaboration (see Alliance partners), and events that bring people together (see GradNation campaign).
===Presidents' Summit for America's Future===
In July 1995, former Michigan Governor George Romney (and father of 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney) outlined his vision of “a summit at which all living presidents and leaders from all sectors of society would gather to support citizen service and show it was not a partisan issue.”<ref> urltoken CNN, Clinton kicks off volunteer summit, April 27, 1997</ref><ref> urltoken Wofford, Harris, Can National Service Become Integral to Our Culture? Democracy Journal, Summer 2004.</ref> Only four days after completing this outline, Romney died of natural causes.<ref> urltoken CNN, Clinton kicks off volunteer summit, April 27, 1997</ref>
Before his death, however, Romney shared his vision of this bipartisan summit focused on volunteerism with former U.S. Senator Harris Wofford, who had recently become CEO of the Corporation for National and Community Service and Bob Goodwin, president of Bush’s Points of Light Foundation. Wofford and Goodwin agreed to enlist their organizations in fulfilling Romney’s plans for the summit, so Romney “died knowing that the summit would go forward.”<ref></ref>
In his 1997 State of the Union address, President Bill Clinton laid out the overarching theme and goal of the summit: "to mobilize America's citizen power in a united effort to solve our common problems, especially those that threaten our young people."<ref></ref>
Three months later, Presidents Clinton and George H. W. Bush officially co-convened the Presidents’ Summit for America’s Future in Philadelphia.<ref> urltoken Sun Sentinel, Volunteer Recruitment Falls Short But Powell Effort Deserves Respect, May 3, 1998</ref> Retired Gen.

In 1998, Gen. Powell responded to criticism that the summit and ensuing America’s Promise campaign were little more than symbolic gestures and reported that, as a result of the summit, among other things, Big Brothers and Big Sisters amassed a 22 percent increase in adults enlisting as mentors; Boys and Girls Clubs of America added 100,000 new members; the U.S Chamber of Commerce committed to helping 3 million young people find summer jobs; and the LensCrafters company gave 100,000 free eye exams to children from low-income families.<ref> urltoken Sun Sentinel, Volunteer Recruitment Falls Short But Powell Effort Deserves Respect, May 3, 1998</ref>
==Notable leaders==
Gen. Colin L. Powell, USA (Ret) served as the founding chair of America’s Promise and remained board chair until 2001, when he stepped down to become U.S. Secretary of State. Former governor of Montana Marc Racicot took over as chair, followed by former U.S. Senator Harris Wofford in 2002.<ref> urltoken Youth Today, Racicot Out, Wofford In at America’s Promise, February 1, 2002</ref>
Alma Powell, a respected audiologist and General Powell’s wife, became chair in 2004. She published two children’s books in 2003, America’s Promise and My Little Wagon.
In 2004, America’s Promise – The Alliance for Youth changed its name to America’s Promise Alliance to place a greater emphasis on the strength of Alliance partners (see Alliance partners). "We see ourselves as a convener, a catalyst for action, and we help our partners and communities that focus on the measurable goals," said then-CEO Marguerite Kondracke.<ref> urltoken Points of Light Foundation, Points of Light Institute CEO and HandsOn Network Co-Founder Michelle Nunn Featured in The NonProfit Times article</ref>
Kondracke retired as president and CEO in 2012 and was replaced by John S. Gomperts, whose “association with America’s Promise began when he served as chief of staff to Harris Wofford, the CEO of the Corporation for National & Community Service and one of the key conveners of the Summit for America’s Future.”<ref> urltoken AmericasPromise.org, America’s Promise Alliance announces appointment of John S. Gomperts as new president and CEO, March 8, 2012</ref>
Gomperts remains CEO and Mrs. Powell continues to chair the board of directors, which includes notable members such as Miami Foundation President Javier Soto, former First Lady of Kentucky Jane Beshear, former Philadelphia Mayor Rev. Dr. Wilson Goode, and NCTA – The Internet and Television Association President, and General and Mrs. Powell’s son, Michael K. Powell.
The America’s Promise board of directors also includes three full voting youth members. Youth members must be between the ages of 18-24 and agree to serve two-year terms, operating as "a critical and necessary component to the America’s Promise leadership teams," according to Mrs. Powell.<ref> urltoken AmericasPromise.org, Three New Youth Voices Join America’s Promise Alliance’s Leadership, October 5, 2016</ref>

==The Five Promises==
The Presidents’ Summit for America’s Future, the 1997 event that launched America’s Promise Alliance, included a Summit Declaration signed by Presidents Clinton, GHW Bush, Carter, Ford, and Nancy Reagan on behalf of her husband.<ref> urltoken USA Today, Obama's day: America's Promise Summit Declaration, September 22, 2014</ref>
The Summit Declaration pledged to fulfill the “promise of America” for every child, which remains the core objective of America’s Promise. Specifically, the declaration outlined five essential resources the presidents agreed all children need to develop into successful adults, referred to as the Five Promises, which form the basis of America’s Promise efforts and initiatives.<ref></ref>

The Five Promises are: caring adults to guide and encourage them; safe places, both physical and psychological, in which students can safely develop; a healthy start in the form of proper nutrition and exercise; effective education that prepares them for work and life; and opportunities to help others and foster a sense of community, self-respect and service.<ref> urltoken CNN, Text of Summit Declaration, April 28, 1997</ref><ref> urltoken AmericasPromise.org, The Five Promises</ref>

==Alliance partners==
One of the greatest strengths of America’s Promise Alliance, one organizational analysis noted, is its ability to coordinate the national response to youth development by collaborating with its many partners, who “provide the arms and legs with which to carry out the Five Promises.”<ref> urltoken Floyd, D. and Sauer, R.(n.d.), America’s Promise: A Catalyst for Youth Issues. University of Minnesota Digital Conservancy, 2012</ref>
America’s Promise counts nearly 400 national partners in its multi-sector alliance. Corporate partners include Target Corporation and State Farm; foundation partners include Usher’s New Look Foundation and the Ford Foundation; nonprofit partners include Boys & Girls Clubs of America, the YMCA, and Big Brothers Big Sisters of America; education partners include the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), ASCD, and the Education Commission of the States; faith-based partners include Catholic Charities USA and Faith Leaders for Community Change.

==GradNation Campaign==
In 2006, two America’s Promise Alliance partner organizations, Civic Enterprises and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, released the study, The Silent Epidemic: Perspectives of High School Dropouts. The report revealed that nearly one third of public high school students were failing to graduate high school with their class. The research also explored the reasons why so many students were dropping out of school and drew national attention to the “silent epidemic” of high school dropouts.<ref> urltoken Civic Enterprises, The Silent Epidemic: Perspectives of High School Dropouts, March 2006</ref> 
 
Spurred by the urgency to end this dropout crisis, America’s Promise launched the Dropout Prevention campaign in 2008,<ref> urltoken Philanthropy News Digest, America's Promise Alliance Launches Campaign to Combat Dropout Crisis, April 2, 2008</ref> later named the GradNation campaign, and hosted 105 Dropout Prevention Summits in all 50 states from April 2008 until 2010.<ref> urltoken AmericasPromise.org, Dropout Prevention Campaign]</ref> The summits worked to increase awareness about the dropout crisis, encourage collaboration between different sectors and organizations, and facilitate action in states and communities to improve their graduation rates.<ref> urltoken AmericasPromise.org, America's Promise Celebrates 15 Years, April 19, 2012</ref>
Overall, more than 33,000 educators, business leaders, nonprofit leaders, policymakers, families, and youth attended these summits. An analysis from Duke University found that these summits helped raise public awareness about the high school dropout crisis and inspired the creation of new programs and collaborative efforts.<ref> urltoken Gifford, B. and Evans, K., America’s Promise Alliance Dropout Prevention Summits: Mobilizing Action to Address the High School Dropout Crisis Across the Nation, Duke University</ref>
In early 2009, America’s Promise Alliance commissioned Grad Nation: A Guidebook to Help Communities Tackle the Dropout Crisis, written by Robert Balfanz and Joanna Hornig Fox of the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University and John M. Bridgeland and Mary McNaught from Civic Enterprises,<ref>Grad Nation: A Guidebook to Help Communities Tackle the Dropout Crisis Civic Enterprises, Grad Nation: A Guidebook to Help Communities Tackle the Dropout Crisis, 2009</ref> to provide communities with research and best practices to raise graduation rates at the local level.
In 2010, America’s Promise partnered with the Alliance for Excellent Education, Civic Enterprises, and the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University to set the GradNation campaign goal of achieving a 90 percent on-time national high school graduation rate and increasing postsecondary enrollment by 2020.<ref> urltoken AmericasPromise.org, America's Promise Celebrates 15 Years, April 19, 2012</ref> President Obama joined U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and General and Mrs. Powell for the announcement at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.<ref> urltoken U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation, President Obama Champions Education at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, March 3, 2010]</ref>
State Farm was a lead sponsor of the campaign, which also pledged to focus on reducing the country’s number of “dropout factories,” or schools where “less than 60 percent of students who started as freshmen remain enrolled four years later.”<ref> urltoken The Associated Press, November 10, 2015</ref><ref> urltoken State Farm, Better Opportunities Mean Brighter Futures</ref>

“Just 10 years ago, the nation's on-time high school graduation rate was hovering around 70 percent, where it had been stuck for decades,” CEO John S. Gomperts wrote in Education Week in 2016.
In October 2016, President Obama announced that the on-time high school graduation rate had again reached a record high for the fifth year in a row,<ref> urltoken NPR, The High School Graduation Rate Reaches A Record High — Again, October 17, 2016</ref> this time at 83.2 percent.<ref> urltoken The White House, FACT SHEET: President Obama Announces High School Graduation Rate Has Reached New High, October 17, 2016</ref> 
 
“The greatest credit goes to students, families and teachers who are putting in the work and showing great determination and resolve, sometimes in the face of great challenge,” Gomperts wrote in September 2016.<ref> urltoken AmericasPromise.org, Five Reasons I’m Optimistic About the Class of 2020, September 8, 2016</ref>
===Building a Grad Nation===
In 2010, the campaign’s leading organizations worked together to release the Building a Grad Nation report, research that analyzes the progress and challenges of raising the national high school graduation rate.
U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan spoke at the launch of the report, calling it “required reading for those who believe that the high school dropout problem is too intractable to successfully take on.”<ref> urltoken U.S. Department of Education, Secretary Arne Duncan's Remarks at the Release of America’s Promise Alliance Report, “Building A Grad Nation”, November 30, 2010</ref> The four organizations – America’s Promise Alliance, the Alliance for Excellent Education, Civic Enterprises, and the Everyone Graduates Center – have released the report every year since 2010.<ref> urltoken "AmericasPromise.org, Building A Grad Nation Report</ref>

==The Center for Promise==
In 2012, America’s Promise partnered with Tufts University School of Arts and Sciences to open the Center for Promise, an applied research institute studying what helps “create the conditions so that all young people in America have the opportunity to succeed in school and life.”<ref> urltoken AmericasPromise.org, America’s Promise Alliance launches the Center for Promise at Tufts University School of Arts and Sciences, December 13, 2012</ref>
In 2014, the Center produced the report, Don't Call Them Dropouts: Understanding the Experiences of Young People Who Leave High School Before Graduation, which drew national attention<ref> urltoken Washington Post, At-risk students need more help from us, not Washington, August 29, 2014</ref> to the challenging life and socioeconomic factors that cause many students to drop out of high school.<ref> urltoken Salon, Paul Ryan’s dropout delusion: Here’s the real reason kids don’t graduate, May 21, 2014</ref> Similar to the Silent Epidemic study, Don't Call Them Dropouts focused heavily on youth perspective and analysis.
“Rather than merely boredom or lack of motivation, young people who drop out are likely growing up in ‘toxic environments’ with unstable families, violent neighborhoods, and unsafe schools,” an Education Week article said of the report. “Some students are caregivers for parents, siblings, or their own children. Others are homeless or the victims of abuse.”<ref> urltoken Education Week, Report Gives Glimpse Into Why High School Students Don't Finish, May 20, 2014</ref>
In 2015, the Center for Promise moved from Tufts University to the Boston University School of Education.<ref></ref> That same fall, the Center produced a follow-up study to Don't Call Them Dropouts that examined the role that relationships with adults play in keeping students in school called Don't Quit On Me: What Young People Who Left School Say About the Power of Relationships.<ref> urltoken AmericasPromise.org, Special Report: Don't Quit on Me, September 6, 2015</ref>
The Center’s 2016 study, Who's Minding the Neighborhood?

America's Promise Alliance is the nation’s largest cross-sector alliance of nonprofit, community organizations, businesses, and government organization dedicated to improving the lives of young people.<ref></ref>
The organization was founded on the idea that children and youth need “Five Promises” to thrive—caring adults, safe spaces, a healthy start, effective education, and the opportunity to serve—but that not nearly enough young people have access to these basic resources.
America’s Promise works to raise awareness about the importance of these resources and inspire actions that help more children and youth receive them. The organization does this by leading national public awareness campaigns, conducting research, hosting events and convening summits, and partnering with hundreds of national, state, and community organizations that work directly with youth.<ref> urltoken Floyd, D. and Sauer, R.(n.d.), America’s Promise: A Catalyst for Youth Issues.
