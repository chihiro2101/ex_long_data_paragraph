Monmouth College

===Sustainability===
Monmouth College has reduced its energy consumption and has substantially increased its recycling contributions in recent years. These efforts include energy reduction through the installation of numerous new heating boilers throughout campus, the use of energy-efficient lighting, low-flow water systems and the replacement of windows in nearly all older buildings. The new Center for Science and Business includes energy efficient heating/cooling systems and heat recapture exhaust systems among many other features.<ref></ref> Recycling efforts now extend into every student residence and office building.<ref name=":1"></ref> Some students have also committed themselves to sustainability of food production by opting to live in the college's Garden theme housing which grows its own organic food and harvests its own honey using college facilities including seven acres set aside for such use. The college also provides scholarships for students who have demonstrated leadership in sustainability prior to enrolling.<ref></ref>
The college provides free access to bicycles for student use,<ref name=":1"/> and an electric vehicle recharging station is located on campus.<ref></ref>
===Study abroad and off-campus===
Over seventy off-campus programs are available in over fifty countries and may run for as little as ten days or as long as a year but generally last one semester. Programs offered through the Associated Colleges of the Midwest consortium take place usually for one semester at over a dozen locales around the globe and include cultural, scientific, economic, historical and other forms of study and research.<ref></ref> The diversity of these programs spans such topics as scientific research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to government interning in Washington, D.C. to cultural activities in Florence, Italy. Monmouth College faculty frequently teach in these programs along with other members of the consortium including Carleton College, Grinnell College, and eleven other colleges. Other programs run exclusively by Monmouth College include a wide-ranging program in Scotland.<ref></ref>
In 2012, four Monmouth College students studied at the Fulbright International Summer Institute in Bulgaria, accompanied by a Monmouth College Associate Dean who taught at the Institute.<ref></ref>
===Hewes Library===
With over a half-million items catalogued, the Hewes Library provides students access to its broad collections. Besides books and periodicals and a large interlibrary loan capability, the library also houses collections of antiquities, rare books, art, archaeology, and also computer laboratories and high-tech support. A major remodeling in 2000 has resulted in a modern open-stack facility.<ref></ref>
===Fellowships and internships===
Hundreds of internships are arranged annually for students through the Wackerle Career and Leadership Center. These include public service work around the country. Students have also interned, beginning as early as the first year, opting from opportunities at such businesses as Caterpillar Inc., Deere & Co., Monsanto, law offices, medical offices, and many others. Summer internships are also available at the college in such offices as Admission, Financial Aid, Student Life, Hewes Library, Marketing communication, fundraising and others.<ref></ref>
Summer research opportunities exist for students and also incoming freshmen and transfers in the sciences and many other areas of study. This research is conducted with professors and students working in groups and includes such varied topics such as lightning research, archaeology and music. Included are allowances for a stipend and room and board expenses.
==Cost of attendance and financial aid==
Monmouth's comprehensive tuition, room, and board fees for the 2015–16 academic year is $42,450. Once miscellaneous personal expenses are factored in the total cost to attend for the 2015–16 academic year is approximately $45,400.<ref></ref>
Despite its cost of attendance shown above, Monmouth College provides scholarships or financial aid to over 98% of students. The average financial aid package award for 2014–15 was $30,090 (of which $4,325 were loans and work study); the average net price of attendance was $10,760. This average is for all freshmen students including those with no financial need.
Merit scholarships are automatically offered upon the completion of application to the college.<ref></ref> Competitive scholarships in the areas of fine arts, sustainability, Presbyterian, and Latin are determined by an application process in January or February annually. Need-based financial aid is determined by the student filing the FAFSA federal form. These students are encouraged to file this form in January although later filing is accepted. The college maintains a staff of experts who aid students and parents in working through these processes in order to build the best possible financial package.<ref></ref> Outside scholarships are accepted with no reduction in Monmouth College aid or scholarships.
