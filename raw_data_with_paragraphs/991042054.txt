Mahamaham

==Legend==
The Mahamaham tank is surrounded by small temple mandapas with Vedic and Puranic deities, each with a Shiva linga in the sanctum. It also features the big Kashi Vishwanathar temple to its north. At the entrance temple gate, there is the image of Shiva with nine Indian river goddesses: Ganga, Yamuna, Sarasvati, Narmada, Godavari, Krishna, Tungabhadra, Kaveri, and Sarayu.<ref name="Eck2012p156"/> Portions of the Periya Purana are inscribed inside the mandapas and the temple. The complete legend is found on the inner walls of the Kumbheshvara temple near the water pool. According to this legend, after the end of each cyclic existence, there is a Mahapralaya (great flood) when Shiva helped save all creation by floating all seeds of creation and amritam (nectar of immortality) in a pot (kumbha). The flood subsided and the pot came to rest on ground, which was broken by an arrow by Shiva in a hunter form. This spilled the contents into a large pool that became the Mahamaham tank.<ref name="Eck2012p156"/> Another legend is painted pictorially. This shows Brahma being instructed by Shiva to preserve all seeds of creation and life forms in a giant kumbha (pot) during a great flood. It floats to Meru, survives the floods, and when the floods end the pot comes to rest near the banks of Kaveri river in a place now called Kumbhakonam. Shiva, in the form of Kiratamoorty (hunter) breaks it and the water inside the pot becomes the Mahamaham tank. The coconut on top of the pot breaks and becomes the lingas.<ref name="Eck2012p156"/> The pot parts were memorialized by the many mandapa and temples near the tank and the Kumbhakunam region: Kumbeswara, Someswara, Kasi Viswanatha, Nageswara, Kamata Viswanatha, Abimukeshwara, Goutameswara, Banapuriswara, Varahar, Lakshminaryana, Sarangapani, Chakrapani and Varadharaja.
Astronomically, Maha maham or magha festival is celebrated in the month when full moon occurs as moon is passing Magha nakshatra (Leo sign) and Sun is on the other end in the opposite Aquarius sign (Kumnha Rasi). Mahamagham occurs once in twelve years when the planet Jupiter's residence in Leo coincides with full-moon in Leo. On the day of the festival in the month of Magha, it is believed to bring all water bodies together and water is rejuvenated.<ref name=Ayyar>#Ayyar, pp. 320-323</ref>
==History==
The antiquity of the event is deduced from the architectural and epigraphy. The visit of Krishandevaraya during 1445 CE is recorded in an inscription in the gopuram of Nagalpuram, a village in Chengalpattu district. That Krishnadevaraya visited the event is also recorded in the inscription found in the Shiva temple in Kuthalam.<ref name=Ayyar/> The ceiling of the Gangatirtha mandapam carries the sculptural representation of Tulapurushardava. It is believed that the 16th-century Nayak era prime minister Govinda Dikshitar attended the event and donated gold which help build the sixteen mandapas.
The tank is significant particularly to the South Indian Hindus. The festival is a symbolic equivalent to the Kumbh Mela pilgrimage at Prayaga in Uttar Pradesh.<ref name="Eck2012p156"/>
==The Festival==
The Masimaham is an annual event that occurs in Kumbakonam in the Tamil month of Masi (February–March) in the star of Magam.<ref name="Gajrani">S. 2004, p. 240</ref> Vast crowds of Hindu devotees gather at Kumbakonam to have a dip in the tank.

In the northern bank mandapa, there is an inscription of Tulapurshadana, a practise of weighing oneself against gold.

The ceremony is usually performed in sacred places like temples, rivers and tanks. The amount of gold thus weighed is distributed among deserving men.

The tank and temple premises spread over 20 acres, while the water pool with ghat-like steps covers an area of over 6 acres. It is square in its original design, but infrastructure upgrades and extensions have made it somewhat trapezoidal in shape. The tank is surrounded by 16 small Mandapams (shrines)<ref>#Bansal, p. 126</ref> and has 21 wells inside the tank. The names of the wells carry the name of Lord Shiva or that of Rivers of India.<ref name="dict"/> Govinda Dikshitar, the chieftain of Ragunatha Nayak of Thanjavur, constructed the sixteen Mandapams and stone steps around this tank.<ref name="V.">#V., p.120</ref>

Mahamaham, also known as Mahamagham or Mamangam, is a Hindu festival celebrated every 12 years in the Mahamaham tank located in the South Indian town of Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu, India. This 20-acre square tank surrounded by Shiva mandapams is believed by Tamil Hindus to be ancient, and the holy confluence of nine Indian river goddesses: Ganga, Yamuna, Sarasvati, Narmada, Godavari, Krishna, Tungabhadra, Kaveri, and Sarayu, states Diana Eck – a professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies.<ref name="Eck2012p156"/> On the day of the Mahamaham festival, the river goddesses and Shiva gather here to rejuvenate their waters, according to a legend in the Periya Purana.<ref name="Eck2012p156"/> The Hindus consider taking a pilgrimage and holy dip at the Mahamaham tirtha on the day of Mahamaham festival as sacred. The event attracts chariot processions, street fairs and classical dance performances in temple mandapas. The 12-year cycle Mahamaham festival in Tamil Nadu is observed in the Hindu calendar month of Magha, and is a symbolic equivalent of the Kumbh Mela in Prayag, Uttar Pradesh.<ref name="Eck2012p156"></ref>
The Mahamaham festival – also referred to as the Maha Magam festival – and the holy dip tradition of the South Indian Hindus was documented by the British colonial era writers in the 19th-century.<ref>See e.g. Indian Antiquary (May 1873), Volume 2, pages 151-152, Harvard University Archives</ref> The 2016 Mahamaham was celebrated on 22 February 2016 with over a million people from various places taking the holy dip in the Mahamaham tank.<ref>On 25 February 1955, the festival attracted about a million Hindu bathers in a single day, where the festival is observed according to the Tamil Hindu calendar approximately once every 12 years (Georgian calendar). – urltoken A History Of Dharmasastra V 5.1, PV Kane (1958), page 375</ref> The festival with its dip-in-the-tank-waters tradition extends over 10 days (Brahmothsavam). The 10-day festivities are also observed with lesser crowds in the Magha month (about February) every year between the 12-year Maha (major) cycle. In the interim years, the event is called the Masi-maham festival.<ref></ref>
