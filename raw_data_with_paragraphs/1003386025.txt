Charles Carroll of Carrollton

==Family==
Charles Carroll of Carrollton married Mary Darnall (1749–1782), known as Molly, on June 5, 1768. She was a granddaughter of Henry Darnall (Charles Carroll was a great grandson of Henry Darnall).<ref></ref> They had seven children before Molly died in 1782, but only three survived infancy:
* Mary Carroll (1770–1846), who married Richard Caton (1763–1845), an Englishman who became a Baltimore merchant. From 1820 to 1832, Carroll would winter with the Catons in Baltimore. Their daughters were:
** Marianne Caton (1788–1853), who married Robert Patterson (brother of Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte). After his death, she married British statesman Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley (1760–1842), who was the brother of the legendary military commander Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, who was believed to have been previously Marianne's paramour.
** Elizabeth Caton (1790–1862), who married Baron Stafford.
** Louisa Caton (1793–1874), who married Col. Felton Hervey-Bathurst. After his death, she married Francis D'Arcy-Osborne (later the Duke of Leeds).
** Emily Caton (1794/5-1867), who married John McTavish (1788–1852), British Consul at Baltimore. They were parents of four children including Mary Wellesley McTavish (1826–1915), The Hon. Mrs Henry George Howard (of the Earls of Carlisle).<ref></ref>
* Charles Carroll Jr. (1775–1825) (sometimes known as Charles Carroll of Homewood because he oversaw its design and construction), married Harriet Chew (1775–1861) and lived in Philadelphia. Harriet was the daughter of Benjamin Chew, the chief justice of Pennsylvania, and her sister married John E. Howard, who had served in the Senate with Charles Carroll of Carrollton. Charles Jr. reportedly consumed up to two quarts of brandy a day. This led to erratic behavior that resulted in his separation from Harriet.
* Catherine ("Kitty") Carroll (1778–1861), who married Robert Goodloe Harper (1765–1826), a lawyer and U.S. senator.
Today, Carroll's descendants continue to own Doughoregan Manor, the largest parcel of land in Howard County, Maryland, with over 1000 acres (4&nbsp;km²) of valuable but historically preserved land in Ellicott City, Maryland.
=== Other possible descendants ===
Anne Marie Becraft's grandmother, a free Black, worked as a housekeeper for Carroll and was likely his concubine; Carroll presented Annie Marie's father with several of the Carroll family’s prized relics, paintings, and other keepsakes just before Carroll’s death in 1832.<ref></ref>
==Carroll's signature==
In the 1940s, newspaper journalist John Hix's syndicated comic Strange as It Seems published an interesting, but apocryphal, explanation for Charles Carroll's distinctive signature on the Declaration of Independence. Every member of the Continental Congress who signed this document automatically became a criminal, guilty of sedition against King George III. Carroll, because of his wealth, had more to lose than most of his companions. Some of the signators, such as Caesar Rodney and Button Gwinnett, had unusual and distinctive names which would clearly identify them to the King; other signators, with more commonplace names, might hope to sign the Declaration without incriminating themselves.
According to Hix, when it was Carroll's turn to sign the Declaration of Independence, he rose, went to John Hancock's desk where the document rested, signed his name "Charles Carroll" and returned to his seat. At this point another member of the Continental Congress, who was prejudiced against Carroll because of his Catholicism, commented that Carroll risked nothing in signing the document, as there must be many men named Charles Carroll in the colonies, and so the King would be unlikely to order Carroll's arrest without clear proof that he was the same Charles Carroll who had signed the Declaration. Carroll immediately returned to Hancock's desk, seized the pen again, and added "of Carrollton" to his name.
In fact, Carroll had been appending "of Carrollton" to his signature for over a decade, the earliest surviving example appearing at the end of a September 15, 1765, letter to his English friend William Gibson. Carrollton Manor was the name of a tract of more than twelve thousand acres in Frederick County, Maryland, which the Carroll family leased to tenant farmers.<ref>Hoffman, Ronald, Sally D.

==Carroll in fiction==
Charles Carroll was portrayed by actor Terrence Currier in the 2004 film National Treasure with Nicolas Cage. He is accurately described as the last living signatory of the Declaration of Independence. Although the film does not explicitly state it, it is implied that Carroll died in Washington, D.C.<ref></ref> It is inaccurately stated that Carroll was a Mason; historians of freemasonry agree that there is no evidence that he was, though his son (also named Charles Carroll) is known to have been a member.<ref name="10000.masons.AJ"></ref> A scene which did not make the final cut of the film (but appears as a deleted scene on the DVD) shows then-President Jackson rushing out of the White House to find Carroll's body in a carriage. Unable to meet with Jackson in time, Carroll takes into his confidence his carriage driver, Thomas Gates, the great-great-great-great-grandfather of Nicolas Cage's character, Benjamin Franklin Gates. From Carroll, Thomas receives the last known clue to the Treasure of the Templar Knights.
Carroll is mentioned in the 1939 film Gone with the Wind.
