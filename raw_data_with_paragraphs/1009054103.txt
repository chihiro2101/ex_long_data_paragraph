Siege of Yorktown (1781)

===Casualties===
60 French died and 194 were injured. 28 Americans died and 107 were wounded.
156 British were killed and 326 were wounded with 70 missing.
===Effect of disease===
Malaria was endemic in the marshlands of eastern Virginia during the time, and Cornwallis's army suffered greatly from the disease; he estimated during the surrender that half of his army was unable to fight as a result. The Continental Army enjoyed an advantage, in that most of their members had grown up with malaria, and hence had acquired resistance to the disease. As malaria has a month-long incubation period, most of the French soldiers had not begun to exhibit symptoms before the surrender.<ref></ref><ref>Mann, Charles C. 1493:Uncovering the New World Columbus Created.

===Article 10 controversy===
George Washington refused to accept the Tenth Article of the Yorktown Articles of Capitulation, which granted immunity to American Loyalists, and Cornwallis failed to make any effort to press the matter. "The outcry against the Tenth Article was vociferous and immediate, as Americans on both sides of the Atlantic proclaimed their sense of betrayal."<ref>Skemp, Shiela L. (1990) William Franklin Oxford University Press p. 253</ref>
==Aftermath==
Following the surrender, the American and French officers entertained the British officers to dinner. The British officers were "overwhelmed" by the civility their erstwhile foes extended to them, with some French officers offering "profuse" sympathies for the defeat, as one British officer, Captain Samuel Graham, commented. Equally, the French aide to Rochambeau, Cromot du Bourg, noted the coolness of the British officers, particularly O'Hara, considering the defeat they had endured.<ref>Fleming, Beat the Last Drum: The Siege of Yorktown</ref>
Five days after the battle ended, on October 24, 1781, the British fleet sent by Clinton to rescue the British army arrived. The fleet picked up several Loyalists who had escaped on October 18, and they informed Admiral Thomas Graves that they believed Cornwallis had surrendered.<ref>Fleming p. 34</ref> Graves picked up several more Loyalists along the coast, and they confirmed this fact. Graves sighted the French Fleet, but chose to leave because he was outnumbered by nine ships, and thus he sent the fleet back to New York.<ref>Fleming p. 35</ref>
After the British surrender, Washington sent Tench Tilghman to report the victory to Congress.<ref>Fleming p. 21</ref> After a difficult journey, he arrived in Philadelphia, which celebrated for several days. The British Prime Minister, Lord North, is reported to have exclaimed "Oh God, it's all over" when told of the defeat.<ref></ref> Washington moved his army to New Windsor, New York<ref>Fleming p. 194</ref> where they remained stationed until the Treaty of Paris was signed on September 3, 1783, formally ending the war.<ref>Fleming p. 312</ref> Although the peace treaty did not happen for two years following the end of the battle, the Yorktown Campaign proved to be decisive; there was no significant battle or campaign after the Battle of Yorktown and in March 1782, "the British Parliament had agreed to cease hostilities."<ref>Idzerda p. 176</ref>
==Legacy==
On October 19, 1881, an elaborate ceremony took place to honor the battle's centennial. U.S. naval vessels floated on Chesapeake Bay, and 
special markers highlighted where Washington and Lafayette's siege guns were placed. President Chester Arthur, sworn in only thirty days before, following James Garfield's death, made his first public speech as president. Also present were descendants of Lafayette, Rochambeau, de Grasse, and Steuben. To close the ceremony, Arthur gave an order to salute the Union Flag.<ref>Reeves p. 253</ref>
There is a belief that General Cornwallis's sword, surrendered by Charles O'Hara after the battle, is to this day on display at the White House. However, U.S. National Park Service historian Jerome Green, in his 2005 history of the siege, The Guns of Independence, concurs with the 1881 centennial account by Johnston, noting simply that when Brigadier General O'Hara presented the sword to Major General Lincoln, he held it for a moment and immediately returned it to O'Hara.<ref>#johnston1881, p. 156</ref>
The siege of Yorktown is also known in some German historiography as "die deutsche Schlacht" ("the German battle"), because Germans played significant roles in all three armies, accounting for roughly one third of all forces involved. According to one estimate more than 2,500 German soldiers served at Yorktown with each of the British and French armies, and more than 3,000 German-Americans were in Washington's army.<ref>Cronau, pp. 243–244</ref>

There are thirty current U.S. Army units with lineages that go back to the colonial era.
== Yorktown Victory Monument ==
Five days after the British surrendered, Congress passed a resolution agreeing to erect a structure dedicated to commemorating those who participated in the battle.<ref name=":0" /> Construction of the monument was delayed, however, as the Confederation government had several other financial obligations that were considered to be of a more urgent nature.<ref name=":0" /> In 1834, the citizens of Yorktown asked Congress for the monument to be constructed, and then followed up once again in 1836, but still no action was taken. The desirability of the project was recognized in 1876 ″when a memorial from the Common Council of Fredericksburg, Virginia was before Congress.″<ref> name=":0"> </ref> 
The project was postponed once again until the battle's centennial sparked renewed enthusiasm in the resolution and prompted the government to begin building the monument in 1881 amid national support.<ref name=":0" /> The crowning figure was set on August 12, 1884; the structure was officially reported in a communication as complete on January 5, 1885 and currently resides within Colonial National Historical Park.<ref name=":0"></ref> The artists commissioned by the Secretary of War for the monument project included Mr. R.M.

== Yorktown sesquicentennial celebration ==
A four-day celebration to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the siege took place in Yorktown from the 16th to the 19th October 1931. It was presided over by the Governor of Virginia John Garland Pollard and attended by then President Herbert Hoover along with French representatives. The event included the official dedication of the Colonial National Historical Park.<ref></ref><ref>Bland, Schuyler Otis, urltoken The Yorktown Sesquicentennial, Proceedings of the United States Yorktown Sesquicentennial Commission, in connection with the Celebration of the Siege of Yorktown, 1781, United States Government Printing Office, Washington, 1932, Retrieved on 17 April 2018.</ref> President Ronald Reagan visited Yorktown in 1981 for the bicentennial celebration.

American history books recount the legend that the British band played "The World Turned Upside Down", but the story may be apocryphal.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
Cornwallis refused to attend the surrender ceremony, citing illness. Instead, Brigadier General Charles O'Hara led the British army onto the field. O'Hara first attempted to surrender to Rochambeau, who shook his head and pointed to Washington. O'Hara then offered his sword to Washington, who also refused and motioned to Benjamin Lincoln, his second-in-command. The surrender finally took place when Lincoln accepted the sword of Cornwallis' deputy.<ref>Davis p. 265</ref><ref name="lengel343"/><ref></ref>
The British soldiers marched out and laid down their arms in between the French and American armies, while many civilians watched.<ref>Davis p. 267</ref> At this time, the troops on the other side of the river in Gloucester also surrendered.<ref>Davis p. 268</ref> The British soldiers had been issued new uniforms hours before the surrender and until prevented by General O'Hara some threw down their muskets with the apparent intention of smashing them.
