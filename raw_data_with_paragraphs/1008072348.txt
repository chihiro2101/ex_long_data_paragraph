The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter

== Title ==
The title comes from the poem "The Lonely Hunter" by the Scottish poet William Sharp, who used the pseudonym "Fiona MacLeod".
“Deep in the heart of Summer, sweet is life to me still, But my heart is a lonely hunter that hunts on a lonely hill.”
== Plot ==
The book begins with a focus on the relationship between two close friends, John Singer and Spiros Antonapoulos, deaf-mutes who have lived together for several years. Antonapoulos becomes mentally ill, misbehaves, and despite attempts at intervention from Singer, is eventually put into an insane asylum away from town. Now alone, Singer moves into a new room.
The remainder of the narrative centers on the struggles of four of John Singer's acquaintances: Mick Kelly, a tomboyish girl who loves music and dreams of buying a piano; Jake Blount, an alcoholic labor agitator; Biff Brannon, the observant owner of a diner; and Dr. Benedict Mady Copeland, an idealistic physician.
==Creation and conception==
McCullers sought to create a novel about a character who have other characters revealing their innermost secrets to. Initially her main character was Jewish.<ref name=Evansp188>Evans, p. 188.</ref>
==Characters==
The scholar Nancy B. Rich stated that many of the supporting characters are only concerned about their own causes and never achieve a "clear voice" due to their lack of courtesy to one another.<ref name=Richp113>Rich, p. 113.</ref> Rich also stated that most of the characters do not stand a chance at making meaningful changes towards the governing system.<ref name=Richp117>Rich, p. 117.</ref>
* John Singer
** Singer, an engraver,<ref name=Hamiltonp218>Hamilton, p. 218.</ref> was previously able to talk before becoming mute.<ref name=Richp112>Rich, p. 112.</ref> Various characters perceive Singer as being from or sympathetic to their respective demographic groups.<ref name=Richp110>Rich, p. 110.</ref> Nancy B. Rich states that the character "neither confirms nor denies" these beliefs, making the question of whether they are true "moot".<ref name=Richp110/> Rich also characterizes Singer as doing "almost nothing" in the story except benevolent acts that "suggest democracy at work".<ref name=Richp111>Rich, p. 111.</ref> Rich added that Singer "appears prominent, but in reality.is little more than a memory or an expectation in the minds of other characters" and that the character has an "accessibility" that declines on part of the story.<ref name=Richp111/> Hamilton stated that other characters perceive him as being sympathetic to their needs because of his mute status, and that the characters are wrong in perceiving him as a "god",<ref name=Hamiltonp221>Hamilton, p. 221.</ref> and that Singer's thoughts centrally concern himself and his own needs.<ref name=Hamiltonp222>Hamilton, p. 222.</ref>
** The majority of literary critics have perceived Singer as, in Rich's words, "the pivotal character of the novel", and Rich argues that the interaction of other characters with him is the reason for this.<ref name=Richp110/> Rich described Singer as being there to "objectify the negative force of government".<ref name=Richp110/> Rich stated that critics who did not perceive the political "parable" perceive Singer as a "God figure" with the remaining main cast being "of equal stature in a row behind him."<ref name=Richp117/>
** Initially McCullers conceived him as a Jewish character named Harry Minowitz, based on a painting of a Jewish man in an art gallery whose expression she found to be, as described by Oliver Evans in The Georgia Review , as "wise, kindly, and compassionate".<ref name=Evansp188/>
* Spiros Antonapoulos
** Spiros, the initial character depicted in the story,<ref name=Richp113/> is a sweets manufacturer who is of Greek American. Hamilton stated that before Antonapolous's mental breakdown, he and Singer are not lonely even though the two had no other significant friendships.<ref name=Hamiltonp218/> Carpenter wrote that Singer's and Antonapoulos's "devotion to each other recalls the desperate attachment of the two lonely ranch hands in Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men."<ref name=Carpentercitedp317/>
**Rich stated that Spiros's status as a "deaf mute" "signals that his role.is associated with government" and serves as an "arm" of it.<ref name=Richp112/> Rich wrote that Antonapolous "has always remained just out of view of the major characters."<ref name=Richp112/> Singer is the sole character to remind himself about Antonopolous.<ref name=Richp111/> Rich also stated that Antonapolous symbolizes the Greek and Christian roots of the American political system.<ref>Rich, p. 112-113.</ref> Hamilton stated that Singer overlooks the negative traits of Antonapoulous and thinks of positive ones, and so "offers his worship" to the latter.<ref name=Hamiltonp222/>
* Margaret "Mick" Kelly
** Mick faces the effects of poverty which force her to not achieve her dreams.<ref name=Hamiltonp219>Hamilton, p. 219.</ref> According to Rich, the character "thinks of herself as an individualist" and has "delusions about her morality",<ref name=Richp115>Rich, p. 115.</ref> and that she does "little thinking in general".<ref>Rich, p. 116.</ref> According to Rich Mick "seems at first to be a nonconformist" while in fact Mick is shown to conform by the end of the story, adopting a feminine mode of dress while initially being a tomboy.<ref name=Richp115/> Mick instills a sense of toughness in her brothers because she perceives the outside world as requiring strength from individuals.<ref name=Hamiltonp221/> She also uses Singer as, in Carpenter's words, a "confidant".<ref name=Carpentercitedp317/> Rich stated that ultimately Mick "never matures" in terms of morals nor in terms of her intelligence.<ref name=Richp117/> She becomes depressed after Singer's death.<ref name=Hamiltonp219/>
** McCullers initially conceived Mick as a male character named Jester.<ref name=Evansp188/>
** Rich describes Mick as representing women and ordinary White Americans, particularly the silent majority.<ref name=Richp113/> Most reviewers perceived her as the, according to McDonald, "central personage".<ref name=Richp113/> Rich argues that "she represents the real causes of the failure of democracy" as while she has dreams she is unable to figure out what they are,<ref name=Richp113/> and that she represents "public apathy".<ref name=Richp115/> Rich stated that many reviewers perceive her problems as being external, "social and economic", as opposed to personal issues.<ref name=Richp115/>
* Biff Brannon
** Hamilton states that Brannon has many qualities that could have allowed other characters to turn to him for support, or to make him their "god", and yet the characters instead do that to Singer.<ref name=Hamiltonp219/> Rich states that the character represents "an average, middle class American" through his passion for democracy, gainful employment, and being "vaguely patriotic".<ref name=Richp118>Rich, p. 118.</ref> Rich wrote that "Biff represents middle-class business interests".<ref name=Richp113/> According to Rich, this makes him the sole character who has a chance of making meaningful changes in the governing system.<ref name=Richp117/> Rich also stated that were critics wrongly perceiving him to be "a deviate" with some believing he is secretly attracted to men.<ref name=Richp118/> Rich wrote that Biff fails to "understand" the issues facing other characters even though he "is sympathetic to the others".<ref name=Richp113/> Hamilton wrote that Brannon has the widest "vision" of the five supporting characters and that he realizes that "order" is possible and that dilemmas may be solved.<ref name=Hamiltonp222/> According to Hamilton, "For Biff, universal love is the answer to darkness."<ref name=Hamiltonp222/>
** Rich believes that critics have not focused enough attention on him, arguing "he is the most important character in the parable".<ref name=Richp119>Rich, p. 119.</ref>
* Dr. Benedict Mady Copeland
** Dr. Copeland is estranged from his family due to his focus on what Hamilton calls "his love to man", and Hamilton described him as "agnostic".<ref name=Hamiltonp218/> Rich stated that "Dr. Copeland is only interested in the Negro problem" and that this limits his effectiveness in enacting societal change.<ref name=Richp113/> Carpenter wrote that Singer treats Copeland "as his equal" and "shares Copeland's tortured protests against racial injustice."<ref name=Carpentercitedp317/> Copeland suffers a beating from prison guards when he tries to help his son, and moves to a poor farm as his tuberculosis is fatal.<ref>Hamilton p. 218-219.</ref>
* Jake Blount
** Hamilton stated that Jake is "drunk and abusive" and that "Singer thinks Jake is crazy."<ref name=Hamiltonp218/> Rich argues that his lack of contact with Mick limits his effectiveness.<ref name=Richp113/> Carpenter wrote that with Jake, Singer takes the role as "sympathetic "listener"".<ref name=Carpentercitedp317/>
==Background==
McCullers had started a politically oriented magazine and voiced a possibility of becoming active in politics.<ref name=Richp109>Rich, p. 109.</ref>
==Reception==
When published in 1940, the novel created a literary sensation and enjoyed a rapid rise to the top of the bestseller lists; it was the first in a string of works by McCullers that give voice to those who are rejected, forgotten, mistreated or oppressed. Evans wrote that the initial reaction was "a divided reception from the critics, some of whom were inclined to view it, not so much as a novel in its own right, but as a kind of literary phenomenon—as the precocious product" of a young author who may turn out higher quality product when she is older.<ref name=Evansp188/>
Alice Hamilton wrote in the Dalhousie Review that the presence of so many mutes in the storyline "Taken literally . strains the bounds of credulity."<ref>Hamilton, p. 215.</ref>
Frederic I. Carpenter wrote in English Journal that the ending exhibits "frustration" as Biff Brannon makes comments and as Adolf Hitler makes proclamations over the radio.<ref name="Carpentercitedp317" />
The Modern Library ranked the novel seventeenth on its list of the Modern Library 100 Best Novels. Time included it in "TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005".<ref></ref> In 2004 the novel was selected for Oprah's Book Club.
