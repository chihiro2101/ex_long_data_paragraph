"He, unlike the editors at Virago, had grown up in precisely the kind of area and social conditions that the book described. Although the book never claimed to be other than a work of fiction, the publishers destroyed the stock still in the warehouse and recalled all unsold copies from the bookshops, thus turning it into an expensive bibliographical rarity."<ref></ref>
