Lyme Regis

==Religion==
The parish church of St Michael the Archangel, above Church Cliff, dominates the old town. Dating from the 12th century, it was originally a tripartite structure with an axial tower. Transepts were added around 1200 and two aisles in the 13th century. A new church was built east of the tower and transepts early in the 16th century and the old chancel and aisles removed. The old nave was shortened in the 19th century.<ref>Betjeman, John, ed. (1968) Collins Pocket Guide to English Parish Churches; the South. London: Collins; p. 175</ref>
Mary Anning is buried here and commemorated in a stained-glass window provided by members of the Geological Society of London, an organisation that did not admit women until 1904.

===The Cobb===
The first record of the Cobb, the town's harbour wall, is in a 1328 document describing it as having been damaged by storms.<ref></ref> It was made of oak piles driven into the seabed with boulders stacked between. The boulders had been floated into place, tied between empty barrels. A 1685 account describes it as, "an immense mass of stone, of a shape of a demi-lune, with a bar in the middle of the concave: no one stone that lies there was ever touched with a tool or bedded in any sort of cement, but all the pebbles of the see are piled up, and held by their bearings only, and the surge plays in and out through the interstices of the stone in a wonderful manner."<ref></ref> The Cobb wall provides a breakwater to protect the town from storms and separates Monmouth and Cobb Gate beaches.
The Cobb was of economic importance to the town and surrounding area, creating an artificial harbour that enabled the town to develop as a port and a shipbuilding centre from the 13th century onwards. Shipbuilding was significant between 1780 and 1850; nearly 100 ships were launched, including the 12-gun Royal Navy brig HMS Snap.<ref></ref> Well-sited for trade with France, the port's most prosperous period was from the 16th century until the end of the 18th century. In 1780, the port was larger than the Port of Liverpool but the town's importance as a port declined in the 19th century because it was unable to handle the increase in ship sizes.
The Cobb has been destroyed or severely damaged by storms several times; it was swept away in 1377 when 50 boats and 80 houses were also destroyed. The southern arm was added in the 1690s and rebuilt in 1793 after it was destroyed in a storm the previous year. It is thought that mortar was used in the Cobb's construction for the first time in this rebuilding. It was reconstructed in 1820 using Portland Admiralty Roach, a type of Portland stone. After the Great Storm of 1824, Captain Sir Richard Spencer RN carried out pioneering lifeboat design work in the Cobb harbour.
===Lyme Regis Marine Aquarium===
Open since the late 1950s, Lyme Regis Marine Aquarium is situated in an early 18th century stone building on the Cobb harbour wall. The aquarium showcases some of the abundant local sea life as well as offering an insight into Lyme's rich maritime history.
Visitors have the opportunity to hand feed the shoal of tame Thicklip grey mullet, stroke a lobster, and hold a starfish. Other exhibits include weaver fish, wrasse, blennys, sea mice and crustaceans, including hermit crab.<ref> urltoken Lyme Regis Marine Aquarium</ref>
===Other landmarks===
Town Mill, a watermill dating from 1340, has been restored to working order and produces flour.<ref> urltoken Town Mill, Lyme Regis</ref> It is powered by water from the River Lym via a leat running along a lynch. The Domesday Book records a mill at Lyme in 1086, so the site could be much older. Town Mill Brewery opened in part of the mill in March 2010.<ref></ref>
Near the Town Mill, on the site of an old chapel dedicated to St Mary and the Holy Spirits, is the "Lepers Well". In medieval times "leper" was used as a general description of skin diseases and did not necessarily mean leprosy. A hospital that stood on the site 700 years ago is commemorated by a plaque on the wall of well.<ref></ref> The well water still runs, although probably at a reduced rate. The land was left untouched for many years before it was landscaped as a visitors garden in the 1970s.
The frontage of the Three Cups Hotel in Broad Street dates from 1807. It is believed that Jane Austen stayed in Hiscott's Boarding House on the same site in 1804.<ref>Jo Draper, "The (New) Three Cups," All Over The Town, Journal of The Lyme Regis Society, June 2007.</ref> Since then the hotel has accommodated Alfred Lord Tennyson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Hilaire Belloc, G. K. Chesterton and J. R. R. Tolkien, who spent several holidays there. In 1944 Dwight Eisenhower delivered an important briefing before D-Day to senior Allied officers in the first floor lounge. It was used as a setting in the film The French Lieutenant's Woman in 1981. The owners, Palmers Brewery of Bridport, closed the hotel in May 1990 and put forward plans to demolish the significantly historic rear of the building and replace it with retail units, restaurant, visitor and private accommodation.<ref>"Architectural Appraisal and Assessment of Special Interest: Three Cups Hotel, Broad Street, Lyme Regis" - Forum Heritage Services (January 2010)</ref>
The Royal Lion Hotel is a former coaching inn, dating to the first decade of the 17th century. It is reputedly haunted; many alleged ectoplasms have been sighted in the corridors and cold spots.<ref></ref>
==Culture==
The museum was built on the site of Mary Anning's birthplace and family shop off Bridge Street. It houses a collection of local memorabilia, historical items and exhibits explaining the local Geology and Paleontology treasures. It was formerly known as the Philpot Museum.<ref> urltoken Lyme Regis Museum: About Us </ref> Set into the pavement outside the museum is an example of Coade stone work, in the form of ammonites, reflecting the palaeontology for which the town is famous, and commemorating Eleanor Coade, who had an 18th-century artificial stone factory in London and seaside home, Belmont House, in the town.
The Dinosaurland Fossil Museum is in the former church where Mary Anning was baptised.
Thanksgiving Day has been held since Parliament decreed, at the end of the English Civil War, a day of celebration and prayer in Lyme to commemorate its victory over the long siege of the town by the Royalist forces. The celebration includes residents dressing in period costume to parade through the streets.
Annual events in the town include the Lyme Regis Carnival and Regatta, the Lyme Regis Fossil Festival (in conjunction with the London Natural History Museum), and Mary Anning Day. The traditional conger cuddling event takes place during Lifeboat Week. The carnival and regatta, organised by volunteers, take place over a week in August. The Lyme Regis Gig Club regatta also takes place during Carnival Week.
Bonfire night celebrations include a torchlight procession, bonfire on the beach and firework display. A Christmas Tree Festival has more than 30 trees decorated and displayed in Lyme Regis Baptist Church. An Easter bonnet parade takes place each year in the town on Easter Sunday. A May Day fÃªte features stalls and entertainment from various Lyme groups.
