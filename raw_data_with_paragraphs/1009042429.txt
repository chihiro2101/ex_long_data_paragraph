Redmond Barry

==Early life==
Barry was the third son of Major-General Henry Green Barry, of Ballyclough, Kilworth, County Cork, Ireland, and his wife Phoebe Drought, daughter of John Armstrong Drought and Letita Head. Barry had five brothers and six sisters and was educated at a military school, Hall Place, near Bexley, in Kent.<ref>
</ref> Returning to Ireland in 1829, he was unable to obtain a military commission so began his own further education. Following his own classics programme, translating classical authors into English verse, reading old and new writers, he gained a working knowledge of nearly every subject.
In 1832, he entered Trinity College, Dublin, graduated in 1835 with the usual Bachelor of Arts degree, and was called to the bar in Dublin in 1838.<ref>

After his father's death, Barry sailed for Sydney, capital of the British Colony of New South Wales.
==Life and work in Australia==
Barry arrived in New South Wales in April 1837 and was admitted to the New South Wales Bar.<ref name=Galbally>Galbally, Ann, Redmond Barry: An Anglo-Irish Australian (Carlton, Vic., Melbourne University Press, 1995)</ref> After two years in Sydney, Barry moved to Melbourne, a city with which he was ever afterwards closely identified, arriving at the new Port Phillip Settlement on 13 November 1839.<ref name=Galbally/>
In 1841, Barry served as the defence lawyer for Tunnerminnerwait and Maulboyheenner, two indigenous rebels on trial for murder. Barry questioned the legal basis of British authority over Aborigines who were not citizens and claimed that the evidence was dubious and circumstantial. Despite his best efforts, the two men were found guilty and subsequently hanged on 20 January 1842, becoming List of people legally executed in Australia.<ref></ref><ref>Wikipedia page: Tunnerminnerwait</ref>
After practising his profession for some years, he became commissioner of the Court of Requests, and after the creation in 1851 of the colony of Victoria, out of the Port Phillip district of New South Wales, he became the first Solicitor-General of Victoria, with a seat in both the Legislative and Executive Councils.<ref name=EB/> In 1852 he was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria. Later he also served as acting Chief Justice and Administrator of the government.
Barry was noted for his service to the community, and he convinced the state government to spend money on public works, particularly on education. He was instrumental in the foundation of the Royal Melbourne Hospital (1848), the University of Melbourne (1853), and the State Library of Victoria (1854).<ref name=EB/> He served as the first chancellor of the university until his death and was also president of the trustees of the State Library. He was the first President of the urltoken Ballarat School of Mines (1870), which later became the Ballarat University and now Federation University Australia.<ref></ref>
Barry was the judge in the Eureka Stockade treason trials in the Supreme Court in 1855. The thirteen miners were all acquitted.
In 1857, Barry conducted the inquest into the murder of Inspector-General John Giles Price, who was beaten to death by a group of at least 15 convicts during an inspection of the prison quarries in Williamstown, Victoria. Seven of the convicts involved in the attack on Price were found guilty, and sentenced to death by hanging. The seven men were executed at Melbourne Gaol within a three-day period from 28 to 30 April.<ref>Barry, John Vincent; urltoken The Life and Death of John Price: A Study of the Exercise of Naked Power; Melbourne University Press; 1964</ref>
He chaired the committee for the Victorian Intercolonial Exhibition in Melbourne,<ref name="argos8page"></ref> represented Victoria at the International Exhibition (1862) of 1862 and at the Centennial Exposition of 1876.<ref name=EB/> He was made a knight bachelor in 1860, and was created a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1877.<ref name=EB/>
===Kelly cases===
In October 1878, at Beechworth court, Barry presided over a case in which Mrs Ellen Kelly (King) and two men were accused of aiding and abetting the attempted murder of a Victoria Police constable named Alexander Fitzpatrick. After sentencing Mrs Kelly to three years with hard labour, Barry said, 'if your son Ned were here I would make an example of him for the whole of Australia – I would give him fifteen years'.
In 1880, Barry presided at the final trial of Ned Kelly, who was tried and convicted of murdering three other Victoria Police constables. The trial and sentencing have since been the subject of many articles and books by lawyers and historians. When he sentenced Kelly to Hanging, Barry uttered the customary words "May God have mercy on your soul". According to the transcripts, Kelly replied "I will go a little further than that, and say I will see you there when I go". On 23 November 1880, only twelve days after Kelly's execution, Sir Redmond Barry died from what the doctors described as 'congestion of the lungs and a carbuncle in the neck'.
===Contribution to libraries===
Barry laid the foundations of the Supreme Court Library (Melbourne)<ref> urltoken Supreme Court</ref> and was the prime mover establishing the Melbourne Public Library. As a legislator he promoted the Parliamentary Library. He organised the Governor, Sir Charles Hotham, to lay the foundation stones of University of Melbourne, Melbourne Public Library and Sunbury Industrial School later Sunbury Lunatic Asylum in 1854 – all on the same day.<ref> urltoken "HIS HONOR SIR REDMOND BARRY, KT., M.A., LL.D., &c." Illustrated Australian News for Home Readers (Melbourne) (National Library of Australia): p. 63. 29 February 1872. . Retrieved 9 February 2012.</ref>
 
Sir Redmond Barry virtually single-handedly planned the Melbourne Public Library building and its contents. He had a 'hands-on' approach personally writing book selection and acquisition procedures – even to getting his hands dirty shelving books for the Library's 1856 opening. In 1862 and 1877-78 he went to Europe, England and America, purchasing books and pictures for University, Law and Public Libraries and Art Gallery. As Board of Trustees Chairman he was responsible for starting travelling libraries and supporting extended library hours. In September 1870 he "acquired" Marcus Clarke as Public Library Trustees clerk (later secretary), who until his death in 1881 worked as sub-librarian.
There can be fewer men with greater concern for and a greater and better vision for the young colonial society in which Redmond Barry made his life.<ref>Blainey, Geoffrey, A Centenary History of the University of Melbourne. Carlton, Vic.; Melbourne University Press; 1957</ref> Books and reading were intrinsic to Barry's own educational and intellectual development so he wanted these advantages for other people. The reason for his support of the Melbourne Public Library, the Law Library and his support of Mechanic Institutes was free access to libraries for all not just a select few.
==Personal life==
Barry never married, but had four children to Louisa Barrow, all of whom he acknowledged and supported.<ref name=adb/>
==Death==
The Argus reported Sir Redmond Barry had been suffering from diabetes for about 10 years, but on his return from his trip to Europe and America it was apparent that the disease had affected his system. On Monday, 15 November, he was first troubled with the carbuncle on his neck. Sir Redmond was counselled by his medical adviser to at once rest from duty, but he was reluctant to do so, and continued to attend the court until he was compelled to take rest. He was constantly attended by Dr. Gunst, who however, could scarcely impress his patient with a sense of the very serious nature of his disease, which he regarded somewhat lightly. He became restless, and it was deemed advisable to place him under the constant care of a nurse. Despite the precautions, Barry caught cold through exposure, and congestion of the left lung set in. Dr. Gunst held a consultation with Dr. Teague, and pronounced the case hopeless. The left lung had become greatly congested, and this, together with the exhaustion and wasting away of the system resulting from the previous disease, proved fatal.<ref></ref>
==Memorials and legacy==
The State Library of Victoria has named a reading room after Sir Redmond Barry, who was the first Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Melbourne Public Library. The University of Melbourne of which he was the first Chancellor has a Redmond Barry building named for him. A plaque marking the location of Sir Redmond Barry's residence is located near the corner of Josephine Avenue and High Street Road in Mount Waverley. The University of Melbourne has also established the Redmond Barry Distinguished Professor, a title awarded to professors within the university who display outstanding research and leadership.<ref></ref>
