===Critical response===

The Los Angeles Daily News said that the film had the "bare bones of one of those pseudo-philosophical political allegories Trek has always done so entertainingly. But the movie blows it." It praised the directing of Jonathan Frakes and the computer generated special effects and gave the film two and a half stars overall.<ref></ref> The Daily Herald also gave the film two and a half stars, describing it as a "slickly made" movie with a plot "scaled down to its TV roots", and criticized the "frivolous" romance between Riker and Troi.<ref> </ref> The Washington Times gave the film one and a half stars, saying that it was "consistently flat-footed and slow on the uptake", and that there was "ramshackle confusion during the climactic scenes".<ref></ref>

It said the plot was good, but that it was simply an extended episode of The Next Generation, and gave it a score of six out of ten.<ref> </ref> The British newspaper The People also said it was an extended television episode.<ref></ref>

The reviewer gave the film two stars for fans, and none for non-fans.<ref> </ref> In Folklore/Cinema: Popular Film as Vernacular Culture, the actions of Data and the Ba'ku child Artim in Insurrection are seen as "a metamorphosis motif where a child becomes computerlike and a computer/android becomes more childlike".<ref>#shermankoven: p. 4</ref> Data specifically "is a metaphor for a child who seeks to understand what being human means and then, like the velveteen rabbit, wishes to become. From confronting his father and evil brother to finding his mother, Data also represents the potential within all of us to quest for a fuller humanity".<ref>#shermankoven: p. 87</ref>

The score for Insurrection was composed by Jerry Goldsmith; his fourth score for the franchise.<ref name="bond-163">#bond: p. 163</ref> Goldsmith continued using the march and Klingon themes written for Star Trek: The Motion Picture in 1979, adding new themes and variations. Insurrection opens with Alexander Courage's Star Trek: The Original Series fanfare, introducing a six-note motif used in many of the film's action sequences. The Ba'ku are scored with a pastoral theme with repeating harps, string sections and a woodwind solo. The Ba'ku's ability to slow time was accompanied with a variation of this music.<ref name="bond-164">#bond: p. 164</ref>
Goldsmith used quick bursts of brass music to accompany the starship sequences. For scenes in which observers are watching the Ba'ku unseen, Goldsmith used a "spying theme" that resembles his conspiracy theme from Capricorn One. Composed of a piano, timpani percussion, and brass, the theme builds until it is interrupted by the action theme as Data opens fire. Goldsmith did not write a motif for the Son'a, but scored the action sequence without designating the Son'a as an antagonist, suggesting the film's revelation that the Son'a and Ba'ku are related. The film's climax is scored with the action theme, which is balanced with "sense of wonder" music similar to cues from The Motion Picture.<ref name="bond-164"/><ref></ref>
One scene in the film shows Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner conducting a duet of A British Tar from the Gilbert and Sullivan comic-opera H.M.S. Pinafore.<ref name=brumnotasweknow/> This replaced the original idea of Picard and Data reciting scenes from Shakespeare's play King Lear.<ref name="piller80">#piller1998: p. 80</ref> Stewart had suggested that they sing Three Little Maids from School are we from The Mikado instead, but the producers described this as "too vulgar".<ref name=brumnotasweknow/> Stewart and Spiner had previously sung together on Spiner's 1991 album Ol' Yellow Eyes Is Back.<ref name=brumnotasweknow/>
In 2013, GNP Crescendo Records re-released the soundtrack for the film as an expanded collector's edition GNPD 8082, featuring previously unreleased tracks by Goldsmith plus four bonus tracks.<ref>Jerry Goldsmith (1998). urltoken "Star Trek: Insurrection Expanded Collector's Edition" GNP Crescendo Records.
