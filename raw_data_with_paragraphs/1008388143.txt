Spanish language in the United States

==Current status==
Although the United States has no de jure official language, English is the dominant language of business, education, government, religion, media, culture, and the public sphere. Virtually all state and federal government agencies and large corporations use English as their internal working language, especially at the management level. Some states, such as Arizona, California, Florida, New Mexico, and Texas provide bilingual legislated notices and official documents in Spanish and English and in other commonly-used languages. English is the home language of most Americans, including a growing proportion of Hispanics. Between 2000 and 2015, the proportion of Hispanics who spoke Spanish at home decreased from 78 to 73 percent.<ref name="ajspanish"></ref> As noted above, the only major exception is the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in which Spanish is the official and the most commonly-used language.
Throughout the history of the Southwest United States, the controversial issue of language as part of cultural rights and bilingual state government representation has caused sociocultural friction between Anglophones and Hispanophones. Spanish is now the most widely-taught second language in the United States.<ref></ref>
===California===
California's first constitution recognized Spanish-language rights:
By 1870, English-speakers were a majority in California; in 1879, the state promulgated a new constitution with a clause under which all official proceedings were to be conducted exclusively in English, which remained in effect until 1966. In 1986, California voters added a new constitutional clause by referendum:
Spanish remains widely spoken throughout the state, and many government forms, documents, and services are bilingual in English and Spanish. Although all official proceedings are to be conducted in English:
===Arizona===
The state, like its neighbors in the Southwest, has had close linguistic and cultural ties with Mexico. The state, except for the 1853 Gadsden Purchase, was part of the New Mexico Territory until 1863, when the western half was made into Arizona Territory. The area of the former Gadsden Purchase spoke mostly Spanish until the 1940s although the Tucson area had a higher ratio of anglophones (including Mexican Americans who were fluent in English). The continuous arrival of Mexican settlers increases the number of Spanish-speakers.
===Florida===
Most of the residents of the Miami metropolitan area speak Spanish at home, and the influence of Spanish can even be seen in many features of the local dialect of English. Miami is considered the "capital of Latin US" for its many bilingual corporations, banks, and media outlets that cater to international business. In addition, there are several other major cities in Florida with a sizable percentage of the population able to speak Spanish, most notably Tampa (18%) and Orlando (16.6%). Ybor City, a historical neighborhood close to Downtown Tampa, was founded and is populated chiefly by Spanish and Cuban immigrants. Most Latinos in Florida are of Cuban (especially in Miami and Tampa) or Puerto Rican (Miami and Orlando) ancestry, followed by Mexican (Tampa and Fort Myers/Naples) and Colombian ancestry.
===New Mexico===
New Mexico is commonly thought to have Spanish as an official language alongside English because of its wide usage and legal promotion of Spanish in the state; however, the state has no official language. New Mexico's laws are promulgated in both Spanish and English. English is the state government's paper working language, but government business is often conducted in Spanish, particularly at the local level. Spanish has been spoken in the New Mexico-Colorado border and the contemporary US–Mexico border since the 16th century.
Because of its relative isolation from other Spanish-speaking areas over most of its 400-year existence, New Mexico Spanish, particularly the Spanish of northern New Mexico and Colorado has retained many elements of 16th- and 17th-century Spanish and has developed its own vocabulary.<ref name="Cobos-1">Cobos, Rubén (2003) "Introduction" A Dictionary of New Mexico & Southern Colorado Spanish (2nd ed.) Museum of New Mexico Press, Santa Fe, N.M., p. ix, </ref> In addition, it contains many words from Nahuatl, the language that is still spoken by the Nahua people in Mexico. New Mexican Spanish also contains loanwords from the Pueblo languages of the upper Rio Grande, Mexican-Spanish words (mexicanismos), and borrowings from English.<ref name="Cobos-1"/> Grammatical changes include the loss of the second-person plural verb form, changes in verb endings, particularly in the preterite, and the partial merger of the second and third conjugations.<ref name="Cobos-2">Cobos, Rubén, op. cit., pp. x-xi.</ref>
===Texas===
In Texas, English is the state's de facto official language although it lacks de jure status and is used in government. However, the continual influx of Spanish-speaking immigrants has increased the import of Spanish in Texas. Although it is a part of the Southern United States, Texas's counties bordering Mexico are mostly Hispanic and so Spanish is commonly spoken in the region. The Texas government, in Section 2054.116 of the Government Code, mandates providing by state agency of information on their websites in Spanish to assist residents who have limited English proficiency.<ref>" urltoken Sec. 2054.001."

=== Kansas ===
Spanish has been spoken in the state of Kansas since at least the early 1900s, primarily because of several waves of immigration from Mexico. That began with refugees fleeing the Mexican Revolution (c. 1910–1920).<ref></ref> There are now several towns in Kansas with significant Spanish-speaking populations: Liberal, Garden City, and Dodge City all have Latino populations over 40%.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> Recently, linguists working with the urltoken Kansas Speaks Project have shown how high numbers of Spanish-speaking residents have influenced the dialect of English spoken in areas like Liberal and in other parts of southwest Kansas.<ref></ref> There are many Spanish-language radio stations throughout Kansas, like KYYS in the Kansas City area as well as various Spanish-language newspapers and television stations throughout the state.<ref></ref> Several towns in Kansas boast Spanish-English dual language immersion schools in which students are instructed in both languages for varying amounts of time. Examples include urltoken Horace Mann Elementary in Wichita, named after the Horace Mann, and urltoken Buffalo Jones Elementary in Garden City, named after Charles "Buffalo" Jones, a frontiersman, bison preservationist, and cofounder of Garden City.
===Puerto Rico===
The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico recognizes Spanish and English as official languages, but Spanish is the dominant first language. This is largely due to the fact that the territory was under Spanish control for 400 years, and was inhabited by mainly Spanish-speaking settlers prior to being ceded to the United States in 1898.

==Learning trends==
Spanish is currently the most widely taught language after English in American secondary schools and higher education.<ref>Richard I. Brod . AFL Bulletin. Vol. 19, no. 2 (January 1988): 39–44</ref> More than 790,000 university students were enrolled in Spanish courses in the autumn of 2013, with Spanish the most widely taught foreign language in American colleges and universities. Some 78.6 percent of the total number of U.S. students enrolled in foreign-language courses take Spanish, followed by French (12.7%), American Sign Language (7%), German (5.5%), Italian (4.6%), Japanese (4.3%), and Chinese (3.9%) although the totals remain relatively small in relation to the total US population.<ref name=":1"></ref>
==Radio==
Spanish language radio is the largest non-English broadcasting media.<ref>Todd Chambers, "The state of Spanish-language radio." Journal of Radio Studies 13.1 (2006): 34–50.</ref> While foreign language broadcasting declined steadily, Spanish broadcasting grew steadily from the 1920s to the 1970s.
The 1930s were boom years.<ref>Jorge Reina Schement, “The Origins of Spanish-Language Radio: The Case of San Antonio, Texas,” Journalism History 4:2 (1977): 56–61.</ref> The early success depended on the concentrated geographical audience in Texas and the Southwest.<ref>Félix F. Gutiérrez and Jorge Reina Schement, Spanish-Language Radio in the Southwestern United States (Austin: UT Center for Mexican American Studies, 1979).</ref> American stations were close to Mexico, which enabled a steady circular flow of entertainers, executives and technicians and stimulated the creative initiatives of Hispanic radio executives, brokers, and advertisers. Ownership was increasingly concentrated in the 1960s and 1970s. The industry sponsored the now-defunct trade publication Sponsor from the late 1940s to 1968.<ref>Andrew Paxman, "The Rise of US Spanish-Language Radio From 'Dead Airtime' to Consolidated Ownership (1920s–1970s)." Journalism History 44.3 (2018).</ref> Spanish-language radio has influenced American and Latino discourse on key current affairs issues such as citizenship and immigration.<ref>Dolores Inés Casillas, Sounds of belonging: US Spanish-language radio and public advocacy (NYU Press, 2014).</ref>
==Variation==
There is a great diversity of accents of Spanish in the United States.<ref name="bbc"></ref> The influence of English on American Spanish is very important. In many Latino<ref></ref> (also called Hispanic) youth subcultures, it is common to mix Spanish and English to produce Spanglish, the name for the mixture of English words and phrases to Spanish for effective communication.
The Academia Norteamericana de la Lengua Española (North American Academy of the Spanish Language) tracks the developments of the Spanish spoken in the United States and the influences of English.
===Varieties===
Linguists distinguish the following varieties of the Spanish spoken in the United States:
*Mexican Spanish: the US–Mexico border, throughout the Southwest from California to Texas, as well as in Chicago, but becoming ubiquitous throughout the Continental United States since Mexican Spanish is used as the standard dialect of Spanish in the Continental United States.
*Caribbean Spanish: Spanish as spoken by Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Dominicans. It is largely heard throughout the Northeast and Florida, especially New York City and Miami, and in other cities in the East.
*Central American Spanish: Spanish as spoken by Hispanics with origins in Central American countries such as El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. It is largely heard in major cities throughout California and Texas, as well as Washington, DC; New York; and Miami.
*South American Spanish: Spanish as spoken by Hispanics with origins in South American countries such as Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and Bolivia. It is largely heard in major cities throughout New York State, California, Texas, and Florida.
*Colonial Spanish: Spanish as spoken by descendants of Spanish colonists and early Mexicans before the United States expanded and annexed the Southwest and other areas.
**Californian (1769–present): California, especially the Central Coast
**Isleño Spanish (1783–present): St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana
**New Mexican Spanish: Central and north-central New Mexico and south-central Colorado and the border regions of Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico, and southeastern Colorado
Most Spanish-speakers, other than those of the first generation, tend to speak the language with the accents of American English of the region in which they grow up.

==Phonology==
*Like in most of Hispanic America, and (before and are pronounced as , just like . However, seseo (not distinguishing from is also typical of the speech of Hispanic Americans of Andalusian and Canary Islands. Also, the English pronunciation of soft c helps to entrench seseo even though occurs in English.
*Spanish in Spain, particularly the regions with a distinctive phoneme, pronounces with the tip of tongue against the alveolar ridge. Phonetically, that is an "apico-alveolar" "grave" sibilant , with a weak "hushing" sound that is reminiscent of fricatives. In the Americas and in Andalusia and the Canary Islands, both in Spain, Standard European Spanish may sound similar to like English sh as in she. However, thwt apico-alveolar realization of is common in some Latin American Spanish dialects which lack . Some inland Colombian Spanish, particularly Antioquia, and Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia also have an apico-alveolar .
*American Spanish usually features yeísmo, with no distinction between and , and both are pronounced . However, yeísmo is an expanding and now a dominant feature of European Spanish, particularly in urban speech (Madrid, Toledo) and especially in Andalusia and the Canary Islands, but has been preserved in some rural areas of northern Spain. Speakers of Rioplatense Spanish pronounce both and as or . The traditional pronunciation of the digraph , , is preserved in some dialects along the Andes range, especially in inland Peru and the highlands of Colombia highlands, northern Argentina, and all of Bolivia and Paraguay.
*Most speakers with ancestors born in the coastal regions may debuccalize or aspirate syllable-final to or entirely drop; this, está ("s/he is") sounds like or , as in southern Spain (Murcia, Castile–La Mancha (except the northeastern part), Canary Islands, Ceuta, and Melilla).
* (before or and are usually aspirated to in Caribbean and other coastal dialects as well as in Colombia, southern Mexico, and most of southern Spain. While it may be in other dialects of the Americas and often in Peru, that is a common feature of Castilian Spanish. It is usually aspirated to , like in most of southwestern Spain. Very often, especially in Argentina and Chile, becomes more fronted before high vowels and then approaches the realization of ich-Laut. In other phonological environments, it is realized as either or .
*In many Caribbean dialects, the phonemes and can be exchanged or sound alike at the end of a syllable: caldo > cardo, cardo > caldo. At the end of words, becomes silent, which gives Caribbean Spanish a partial non-rhoticity. That occurs left often happens as well in Ecuador and Chile and is a feature brought from Extremadura and westernmost Andalusia, in Spain.
*In many Andean regions, the alveolar trill of rata and carro is realized as an alveolar approximant or even a voiced apico-alveolar . The alveolar approximant is particularly associated with an indigenous substrate and is quite common in Andean regions, especially in inland Ecuador, Peru, most of Bolivia, and parts of northern Argentina and Paraguay.
*In Puerto Rico, besides , , and , syllable-final can be realized as , an influence of American English: "verso" (verse) can become , besides , , or ; "invierno" (winter) can become , aside from , , or ; and "escarlata" (scarlet) can become , aside from , , or . Word-finally, is usually one of the following:
** a trill, a tap, approximant, , or silent before a consonant or a pause, as in amo paterno 'paternal love', and amor ,
** a tap, approximant, or before a vowel-initial word, as in amo and eterno 'eternal love').
*voiced consonants , , and are pronounced as plosives after and sometimes before any consonant in most Colombian Spanish dialects (rather than the fricative or approximant characteristic of most other dialects), as in pardo , barba , algo , peligro , desde , rather than , , , , . A notable exception is the Nariño Department and most Costeño speech (Atlantic coastal dialects), which feature the soft, fricatives that are common to all other Hispanic American and European dialects.
*Word-finally, is frequently velar in Latin American Spanish and pan (bread) is often pronounced . To an English-speaker, the makes pan sound like pang. Velarization of word-final is so widespread in the Americas that only a few regions maintain the alveolar, , as in Europe: most of Mexico, Colombia (except for coastal dialects), and Argentina (except for some northern regions). Elsewhere, velarization is common although alveolar word-final appears among some educated speakers, especially in the media or in singing. Velar word-final is also frequent in Spain, especially in the South (Andalusia and the Canary Islands) and in the Northwest: Galicia, Asturias, and León.
==Vocabulary==
The usage of Spanish words by American bilinguals shows a convergence of semantics between English and Spanish cognates. For example, the Spanish words atender ("to pay attention to") and éxito ("success") have acquired a similar semantic range in American Spanish to the English words "attend" and "exit." In some cases, loanwords from English turn existing Spanish words into homonyms: coche has come to acquire the additional meaning of "coach" in the United States, it retains its older meaning of "car."<ref></ref>
*Disappearance of de (of) in certain expressions, as is the case with Canarian Spanish: esposo Rosa for esposo de Rosa, gofio millo for gofio de millo, etc.
*Doublets of Arabic-Latin synonyms, with the Arabic form are more common in American Spanish, which derives from Latin American Spanish and so is influenced by Andalusian Spanish, like Andalusian and Latin American alcoba for standard habitación or dormitorio ('bedroom') or alhaja for standard joya ('jewel').
*See Spanish dialects and varieties#Vocabulary.
==Future==
Spanish-speakers are the fastest growing linguistic group in the United States. Continued immigration and the prevalent Spanish-language mass media (such as Univisión, Telemundo, and Azteca América) support Spanish-speakers. Moreover, the North American Free Trade Agreement makes many American manufacturers use multilingual product labeling in English, French, and Spanish, three of the four official languages of the Organization of American States (the other is Portuguese).
Besides the businesses that always have catered to Hispanophone immigrants, a small but increasing number of mainstream American retailers now advertise bilingually in Spanish-speaking areas and offer bilingual customer services. One common indicator of such businesses is Se Habla Español, which means "Spanish Is Spoken".
The annual State of the Union Address and other presidential speeches are translated into Spanish, following the precedent set by Bill Clinton's administration. Moreover, non-Hispanic American origin politicians fluent in Spanish speak in Spanish to Hispanic-majority constituency. There are 500 Spanish newspapers, 152 magazines, and 205 publishers in the United States. Magazine and local television advertising expenditures for the Hispanic market have increased substantially from 1999 to 2003, with growth of 58 percent and 43 percent, respectively.
Historically, immigrants' languages tend to disappear or to be reduced by generational assimilation. Spanish disappeared in several countries and US territories during the 20th century, notably in the Philippines and in the Pacific Island countries of Guam, Micronesia, Palau, the Northern Marianas islands, and the Marshall Islands.
The English-only movement seeks to establish English as the sole official language of the United States. Generally, they exert political public pressure upon Hispanophone immigrants to learn English and speak it publicly. As universities, business, and the professions use English, there is much social pressure to learn English for upward socio-economic mobility.
Generally, Hispanics (13.4% of the 2002 US population) are bilingual to a degree. A Simmons Market Research survey recorded that 19 percent of Hispanics speak only Spanish, 9 percent speak only English, 55 percent have limited English proficiency, and 17 percent are fully English-Spanish bilingual.<ref></ref>
Intergenerational transmission of Spanish is a more accurate indicator of Spanish's future in the United States than raw statistical numbers of Hispanophone immigrants. Although Hispanics hold varying English proficiency levels, almost all second-generation Hispanics speak English, but about 50 percent speak Spanish at home. Two thirds of third-generation Mexican Americans speak only English at home. Calvin Veltman undertook in 1988, for the National Center for Education Statistics and for the Hispanic Policy Development Project, the most complete study of Anglicization by Hispanophone immigrants. Veltman's language shift studies document abandonment of Spanish at rates of 40 percent for immigrants who arrived in the US before the age of 14, and 70 percent for immigrants who arrived before the age of 10.<ref></ref> The complete set of the studies' demographic projections postulates the near-complete assimilation of a given Hispanophone immigrant cohort within two generations. Although his study based itself upon a large 1976 sample from the Bureau of the Census, which has not been repeated, data from the 1990 census tend to confirm the great Anglicization of the Hispanic population.
==Literature==
American literature in Spanish dates back to 1610 when a Spanish explorer Gaspar Pérez de Villagrá first published his epic poem History of New Mexico.<ref></ref> However, it was not until the late 20th century that Spanish, Spanglish, and bilingual poetry, plays, novels, and essays were readily available on the market through independent, trade, and commercial publishing houses and theaters. Cultural theorist Christopher González identifies Latina/o authors—such as Oscar Zeta Acosta, Gloria Anzaldúa, Piri Thomas, Gilbert Hernandez, Sandra Cisneros, and Junot Díaz—as having written innovative works that created new audiences for Hispanic Literature in the United States.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
