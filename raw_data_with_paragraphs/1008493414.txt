Kent Hovind

=== Anti-evolution claims ===
Hovind contends that Darwinism produced "Communism, Socialism, Nazism, abortion, liberalism and the New Age Movement".<ref name="radicalreligion"/><ref name="JarrettKentState"/> He blamed the forced Cherokee resettlement on a belief in evolution, although the Trail of Tears preceded Origin of Species by roughly two decades.<ref name="Forrest"/><ref name="KauffmanYD"/> Hovind maintains that biology textbooks are lying in order to brainwash youth.<ref name="Brainwashed"></ref><ref name="Rauser2012"></ref> He said, "Satan is using evolution theory to make kids go to hell."<ref name="CreationEvolutionMeyer"></ref> Hovind claims he is not trying to eliminate evolution from schools,<ref name="Brainwashed"/> but says "schools should teach both viewpoints."<ref name="CreationEvolutionMeyer"/> Hovind said that in order to forge "missing link" transitional fossils to support human evolution, the Smithsonian Institution has 33,000 sets of human remains in its basement, some taken alive (murder).<ref name="Forrest"/><ref name="MooreDecker2008"/> In an interview prior to speaking at Kent State University, Hovind said "You should have another rebellion here at Kent State and do it for the right reason," the reason being protesting evolution and referred to the Kent State shootings when he added, "This time, don't get shot."<ref name="JarrettKentState"></ref>
In the pseudoscience of cryptozoology, Hovind published and co-authored Claws, Jaws, and Dinosaurs with William Gibbons, another Creationist who has searched for Mokele-mbembe under the belief that discovering a cryptid would somehow undermine evolutionary theory and that dinosaurs were dragons.<ref name="LoxtonProthero2013"></ref> Dinosaur Adventure Land had displays about the existence of the Loch Ness Monster<ref name="Grant2011"></ref> and Beowulf as history rather than legend.<ref name="CSICOP"/>
=== Debates ===
Prior to his convictions, Hovind was a prolific debater. While Hovind campaigns against evolution, the level of support for evolution is essentially universal within the scientific community and academia;<ref> available at Wikisource: Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover page 83<br>Sample organizational statements:
* AAAS: 
* InterAcademy Partnership: 
* NSTA: 
NCSE maintains an extensive urltoken list of statements</ref> support for creationism is minimal among scientists in general, and virtually nonexistent among those in the relevant fields: biology, paleontology, geology, etc.<ref></ref><ref></ref> C. A. Chinn and L. A. Buckland classify his debate style, common among Young Earth Creationists, as eristic: focused on winning by rhetoric rather than illuminating by careful examination of evidence.<ref name="TaylorFerrari2012"></ref>
In 1993, Hovind announced that he would be debating the renowned evolutionary biologist, Stephen Jay Gould, who had a longstanding opposition to debating Creationists and had turned down numerous challenges. When contacted about the announcement, Gould said he had never heard of Hovind, much less agreed to debate.<ref></ref>
In May 2004, Michael Shermer debated Hovind in front of a predominantly creationist audience. Shermer claimed the exchange was "not an intellectual exercise", but rather "an emotional drama," and concluded, "Unless there is a subject that is truly debatable with a format that is fair, in a forum that is balanced, it only serves to belittle both the magisterium of science and the magisterium of religion."<ref name="ShermerHovind"></ref> Massimo Pigliucci also debated Hovind, and expressed surprise at Hovind's ignorance of evolutionary theory. Pigliucci recalled Hovind tried "to convince the audience that evolutionists believe humans came from rocks" and subsequently "evolved from bananas."<ref name="Pigliucci2002"></ref> William Reville, Director of Microscopy at University College Cork, wrote that Hovind's ideas are not rational or scientific because they are not testable.<ref></ref> Hovind has repeatedly declined offers for written debates where his claims would be scrutinized by scientists, including his decline of a debate offer from Dave Thomas.<ref></ref>
During a debate with Farrell Till, Hovind said that Donald Johanson had uncovered the leg bones of Lucy at a different site over a mile away from the reported site, in a deeper stratum, quipping, "I would like to know how fast the train was going that hit that chimpanzee."<ref> reprinted in urltoken The REALL News 2(2) (March 1994).</ref> This was clearly contrary to the published statements by Johanson. After Hovind had been informed in 1993 that his statement was false, he agreed to stop using the claim. When he repeated the claim in 1995, he once more agreed he was in error.<ref> A version appears as urltoken Lucy's Knee Joint: How creationists deal with their errors in the Skeptic 15(4):34–6 (Summer 1995). Retrieved 2015-12-03.</ref>
=== $250,000 offer ===
In 1990, Hovind made a $10,000 offer to anyone who could meet a set of requirements he said would prove evolution, and he later raised the amount to $250,000.<ref name="offer"></ref> In 2007, Creation Science Evangelism removed the offer from its website.<ref></ref>
The premises of Hovind's offer have been rejected both by scientists and fellow creationists as fundamentally flawed.<ref name="CMIIntegrity"/><ref name="talkorigins"/> Hovind's conditions would require a claimant to not only prove the theory of evolution, but also abiogenesis, astrophysics and cosmology, and additionally prove that no gods could possibly exist.<ref name=talkorigins></ref> The judges would be hand-picked without assurances that they would be unbiased or qualified to assess the merit of claims, and it is possible that no panel was convened when a claim was submitted. Some forms of evidence would be excluded prior to judging.<ref name="Isaak2007"></ref>
Answers in Genesis dismissed the challenge as a gimmick.<ref name="MooreDecker2008"/> A 2005 challenge on Boing Boing offered $250,000 to anyone who could prove that the Flying Spaghetti Monster (the deity of a parody religion constructed to make a point about giving time to alternative views on evolution) was not the father of Jesus.<ref></ref>
=== Political activity ===
In 1999, a Bradenton, Florida pastor asked the school board to consider adding Creationism to the curriculum. The school board chairman's actions raised issues when, in his capacity as a citizen, he helped fund a series of seminars by Hovind, but he was within ethical guidelines. More controversy was raised when a school employee was sent to videotape the lectures, although without intention for rebroadcast.<ref></ref> Ultimately, there was no curriculum change.<ref></ref>
Hovind was criticized for his involvement with Arkansas state Representative Jim Holt's Anti-Evolution Bill in 2001 (House Bill 2548).<ref name="Hovindconnection">Don Michael, "The Hovind connection: Check your facts, legislators." Northwest Arkansas Times. April 05, 2001</ref><ref></ref> This bill "would have required that when public schools refer to evolution that it be identified as an unproven theory." Opponents of the bill worried that it would subject Arkansas to the same type of derision that occurred when the state's balanced-treatment law was struck down in McLean v. Arkansas.<ref></ref> Holt called upon Hovind as an expert who "testified for Holt before the State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee, alleging much of the information pertaining to evolution in our science textbooks is false."<ref name="Hovindconnection"/>
In 2007, David Vitter added a $100,000 earmark in a U.S. Senate appropriations bill, directed towards the Louisiana Family Forum "to develop a plan to promote better science education". Their website included a document, A Battle Plan—Practical Steps to Combat Evolution' by Kent Hovind". After a reporter's inquiries, the document, which called evolution "not a harmless theory but a dangerous religious belief" and blamed it for atrocities by Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Pol Pot, was removed from their website. The earmark was withdrawn from the bill.<ref name="Blumenthal2010"/><ref></ref>
=== Chick tracts ===
The most widely distributed antievolution work, Big Daddy?,<ref name="MooreDecker2008Chick"></ref> was first published in 1972<ref group="notes">There may also be a 1970 version.</ref><ref name="WorldOfChick"></ref> and revised several times; it is one of the controversial Chick tracts, comic strips intended to convert people to fundamentalist Christianity.<ref name="Burack2008"></ref> Material from Hovind was incorporated into the 2000 revision.<ref name="WorldOfChick"/><ref> urltoken Big Daddy?, tract from Chick Publications.</ref><ref>Article from Chick Publications Battle Cry July/August 2000 Newsletter, urltoken Author Claims Some Dinosaurs Live Today!</ref>
== Politics and conspiracies ==
Hovind has made controversial remarks regarding conspiracies, science, creation, equal rights, religion, and government. His presentations on creationism and evolution are a mix of Christian Fundamentalism and conspiracy theory.<ref name="ShermerHovind"/> His creationist presentations have asserted that creationism is not taught in public schools due to a New World Order conspiracy, established by Satan and involving Ted Turner and Jane Fonda, the British Royal Family, the State of Israel, the American Civil Liberties Union (which he calls "the American Communist Lawyers Union"), U.S. government officials, business leaders, and social activists. In May 1999, he claimed "the implementation of the NWO's world-domination plan was May 5, 2000."<ref name="Holley2015"/><ref name="Delphia"></ref>
Hovind has several conspiracy theories about the U.S. government. He has 9/11 conspiracy theories the 9/11 attacks<ref name="Blumenthal2010"></ref> and the Oklahoma City bombing.<ref name="MooreDecker2008"/> Regarding UFOs, Hovind recommends books by conspiracy theorists who believe "some UFO's are U.S. Government experiments with electrogravitic propulsion as opposed to jet propulsion, while others are Satanic apparitions."<ref></ref><ref name="DinosaursExistGuardian">"Alberta: Evangelist says dinosaurs existed in God's world," The Guardian (Charlottetown), December 2, 2000</ref> The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) criticized Hovind for referring followers to books by Irwin Schiff,<ref name="SPLC2004"/> a tax protester who has been convicted of tax evasion multiple times.<ref></ref> The SPLC has criticized Hovind for "pointing his followers to Citizens Rule Book, popular among antigovernment 'Patriots', and to Media Bypass, an antigovernment magazine with strong antisemitic leanings",<ref name="SPLC2004"/> and for selling of books such as Des Griffin's Fourth Reich of the Rich and Peter Kershaw's In Caesar's Grip, and recommending The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a well-known antisemitic hoax.<ref name="radicalreligion"/>
Hovind claims that the cyanide-releasing compound laetrile is a "cancer cure" which the U.S. government is conspiring to suppress<ref name="CSICOP"/><ref></ref> and that diseases including HIV, Gulf war syndrome, Crohn's colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's were engineered by "the money masters and governments of the world" for the purpose of global economic domination.<ref name="Blumenthal2010"/><ref></ref> He has denounced democracy as "evil and contrary to God's law",<ref name="radicalreligion"></ref> and called global warming a communist conspiracy.<ref name="DinosaursExistGuardian"/>
In his lectures, he claimed that the United States government was implanting pet-tracking microchips into people allowing them to be tracked by satellite,<ref></ref> even though the transponder range made that impossible.<ref name="MarkoftheBeastBS"></ref> On his website, Hovind associated the UPC bar code with the Mark of the beast, and wrote that there were reports of people paying for groceries by having their hands scanned in 1999.<ref name="Forrest"/><ref name="radicalreligion"/><ref></ref>
== YouTube copyright controversy ==
On September 16, 2007, the Rational Response Squad complained that Creation Science Evangelism was filing spurious DMCA requests that had caused RRS YouTube videos to be taken down and the RRS YouTube account to be banned.<ref name="WiredHovind"></ref> In response to the copyright claims, the RRS threatened a lawsuit.<ref name="RRS"></ref><ref name="Christian Post"></ref>
At the time of the complaints, the CSE's website indicated the videos were not copyrighted, and the CSE encouraged copying and distributing them.<ref name="WiredHovind"/> Five days later, the CSE copyright page was changed to say that copied material must be left unedited.<ref name="Ars Technica"></ref> According to a spokesperson for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, CSE's claim was "clearly bogus",<ref name="WiredHovind September 25"></ref> and as of September 25, 2007, the Rational Response Squad account had been reinstated, and some of the videos had been put back online.<ref name="WiredHovind September 25"/>
== Legal problems ==
=== Escambia County (2002–2006) ===

=== Federal civil tax matters, bankruptcy, and renouncing citizenship (1996–2006) ===
Hovind was originally reported to the Internal Revenue Service by Pensacola Christian College senior vice President Rebekah Horton in the mid-1990s, after she learned of Hovind's anti-tax stand.<ref></ref> Hovind's organization had neither business licenses nor tax-exempt status,<ref name="ParkFinance"></ref> nor was it considered a church by people who worked there.<ref name="begins"> The story can be found in the collection: urltoken "The evolution of 'Dr. Dino.</ref><ref name="employees"></ref> The ministry's organizational structure was described by the United States Tax Court as appearing to be "based on various questionable trust documents purchased from Glen Stoll, a known promoter of tax avoidance schemes", leading the Court to conclude that Hovind used these trust documents as well as other fraudulent means to conceal the ownership and control of his activities and properties.<ref name="TCM2006-143"/>
According to the IRS, Hovind earned $50,000 a year through speaking engagements,<ref group="notes">In 2004, Hovind told The New York Times that he had 700 speaking engagements per year.</ref><ref name="DarwinfreeNYT"/> and in 2002 alone, CSE sold more than $1.8 million in merchandise.<ref></ref> On average, Hovind made bank deposits in excess of $1 million each year,<ref name="investigated"></ref> and eventually that grew to about $2 million a year.<ref name="hardtobelive"></ref><ref></ref> About half that income went to employees who were salaried or were paid hourly wages. However, Hovind derived "substantial revenue" from these activities that appeared to be "income to him personally".<ref name="TCM2006-143">Hovind v. Commissioner, urltoken T.C. Memo 2006-143 , CCH December 56,562(M) (2006).</ref>
On March 1, 1996, Hovind filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition to avoid paying federal income taxes, claiming he was not a citizen of the United States and that he did not earn income.<ref name="Bankruptcy">In re Hovind, case no. 96-04256, U.S. Bankr.

The court upheld the IRS's determination that his claim "was filed in bad faith for the sole purpose of avoiding payment of federal income taxes" and called Hovind's arguments "patently absurd". It also said that "the IRS has no record of the debtor ever having filed a federal income tax return."<ref name="Bankruptcy"/>
In 1998, the IRS requested account information about Hovind from an internet provider after Hovind made claims on an internet broadcast about his own Tax noncompliance, going back to the 1970s. When the provider initially balked, the courts granted a subpoena on the basis that the IRS could demonstrate that Hovind had received income but had filed no income tax returns going back to 1991.<ref name="Baruh2007"></ref> In 2003, Hovind would tell The New York Times, "I haven't filed a tax return in 30 years."<ref></ref>
On May 13, 1998, Hovind and his wife filed a "Power of Attorney and Revocation of Signature" document in Escambia County which would nullify any of their promises, debts, or legal agreements made prior to April 15, 1998. The Hovinds claimed they had signed government documents "due to the use of various elements of fraud and misrepresentations, duress, coercion, under perjury, mistake, 'bankruptcy'," and argued that Social Security is a "Ponzi scheme". The document referred to the United States Government as "the 'bankrupt' corporate government", renounced the Hovinds' United States citizenship and Social Security numbers to become "a natural citizen of 'America' and a natural sojourner", and referred to their home state of Florida as "the State of Florida Body-Politic Corporation."<ref name="PowerofAttorney"> urltoken "Power of attorney and revocation of signature" , May 5, 1998.

=== Federal criminal tax-related trial and convictions in 2006 ===
On July 11, 2006, Hovind was indicted on 58 counts in the District Court in Northern Florida in Pensacola. The first 12 counts were charges for willful failure to collect, account for, and pay over federal income taxes and FICA taxes in connection with the CSE operation, totaling $473,818 for the 12 fiscal quarters of 2001–2003. The next 45 counts were charges for knowingly structuring transactions by making multiple cash withdrawals totaling $430,500 in amounts just under the $10,000 which requires reporting (a technique known as "structuring"), for which his wife was also charged. The last count was a charge of corruptly endeavoring to Obstructing government administration by falsely listing the IRS as his only creditor when filing for bankruptcy, filing a false and frivolous lawsuit against the IRS in which he demanded damages for criminal trespass, making threats of harm to those investigating him and to those who might consider cooperating with the investigation, filing a false complaint against IRS agents investigating him, filing a false criminal complaint against IRS special agents (criminal investigators), and destroying records.<ref> urltoken Indictment, United States of America v.

At arraignment, Hovind claimed incomprehension to the charges, telling the court: "I still don't understand what I'm being charged for and who is charging me."<ref name="arrested"/> The presiding magistrate judge asked Hovind if he wrote and spoke English, to which Hovind responded, "To some degree." The judge replied that the government adequately explained the allegations and the defendant understands the charges "whether you want to admit it or not."<ref></ref> Hovind stated that he did not recognize the government's right to try him on tax-fraud charges. At first he attempted to enter a plea of "subornation of false muster," but then entered a not guilty plea "under duress" when the judge offered to enter a plea for him. When asked about his home, Hovind called it a "church parish", and denied any residence except the "church of Jesus Christ", worldwide.<ref name="pleads"/> Hovind's passport and guns were seized. Hovind protested, arguing that he needed his passport to continue his evangelism work, and that "thousands and thousands" were waiting to hear him preach in South Africa the following month. The court refused to reconsider, accepting the argument that "like-minded people" might secret Hovind away if he left the country.<ref name="arrested"/>
The trial began on October 21, 2006. Hovind hoped to convince a jury that his amusement park admission and merchandise sales, over $5 million from 1999 through March 2004, belonged to God and could not be taxed.<ref name="begins"/> Evidence produced at the trial revealed that Jo Hovind had requested financial assistance from Baptist Healthcare by claiming that the Hovinds had no income.<ref name="PNJdenyincome"/> IRS agents told the court how Hovind had attempted "bullying tactics" and had sued the government three times to pressure them to stop investigating. The lawsuits had been thrown out.<ref name="begins"/> The prosecution countered attempts to describe workers as missionaries, ministers, and volunteers, introducing memos in which they had been called employees. Workers testified that they had to punch time cards, had vacation and sick days, and did not receive Form W-2. After the IRS executed the search warrant, employees were required to sign non-disclosure agreements to remain employed.<ref name="employees"/> A lawyer who did work for a non-profit Christian organization testified that Hovind claimed that Hovind had "beat" the tax system and that he favored cash transactions because they were untraceable and, consequently, untaxable.<ref name="detailedactions"></ref>
Hovind's lawyer engaged in a lengthy cross-examination of the lead IRS investigator,<ref></ref> and the case ended on November 1 with the defense calling no witnesses.<ref></ref> After closing arguments were presented on November 2, the jury deliberated three hours before finding the Hovinds guilty on all counts, 58 for Hovind and 45 for his wife.<ref name="WifeSentenced"></ref> The Pensacola News Journal said, "The saddest thing: Had they cooperated with the agents, they probably wouldn't be worrying about prison sentences now."<ref name="hardtobelive"/>
=== Sentencing, appeals, and imprisonment (2007–2019) ===
After the convictions, Hovind was incarcerated in the Escambia County Jail as a "danger to the community" and a flight risk.<ref name="Guilty"> The story can be found in the collection: urltoken "The evolution of 'Dr. Dino.</ref> His wife would remain free until after the appeal.<ref name="sentencesupheld"> The story can be found in the collection: urltoken "The evolution of 'Dr. Dino.</ref>

In May 2013, facing the sale of lots that were once part of Dinosaur Adventure land, Hovind acted. Using legal advice from another inmate, he filed a civil right suit against corrections personnel (a "Bivens action") alleging that they intentionally delayed court documents which hindered another appeal.

On March 2, 2015, the trial began in U.S. District Court for Northern Florida. On the first day of testimony, the prosecution discussed Hovind and Hansen's "dozens of filings", including several lis pendens, used to resist a court-ordered forfeiture due in part to legal advice Hovind took from his "cellmate in a New Hampshire prison camp".<ref name=TrialFirstDay></ref> The prosecution case included numerous emails, recorded phone calls, and court filings related to the forfeited properties.<ref name=TrialFirstWeek/> The prosecution presented audio of Hovind characterizing a lis pendens by asking his daughter, "Have you ever taken a step into dog crap and it gets stuck on your feet and it's really hard to get off?"<ref name=TrialFirstDay/> Hansen and Hovind took the stand in their own defense. According to journalist Kevin Robinson, during Hovind's testimony, he "refused to give short answers" and said that he believed his actions were lawful.<ref name=TakesWitnessStand></ref> On March 12, 2015, Hovind was found guilty on one count of criminal contempt,<ref name=Verdict></ref> Hansen on two counts of criminal contempt,<ref name="codefendant"></ref> and hung jury on the remaining charges.<ref name=Verdict/>
