Ephedra

==Biochemistry and effects==
A wide variety of alkaloid and non-alkaloid compounds have been identified in various species of ephedra. Of the six ephedrine-type ingredients found in ephedra (at concentrations of 0.02-3.4%), the most common are ephedrine and pseudoephedrine,<ref></ref> which are the sources of its stimulant and thermogenic effects.<ref name="Abourashed_2003" /> These compounds stimulate the brain, increase heart rate, constrict blood vessels (increasing blood pressure), and expand bronchial tubes (making breathing easier). Their thermogenic properties cause an increase in metabolism, as evidenced by an increase in body heat.
Ephedra is widely used by athletes as a performance-enhancing drug,<ref name="Bents2006"></ref> despite a lack of evidence that it improves athletic performance.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Ephedra may also be used as a precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine.<ref></ref>
Ephedra has been used as a weight-loss aid, sometimes in combination with aspirin and caffeine. Some studies in regulated and supervised environments have shown that ephedra is effective for marginal short-term weight loss (0.9&nbsp;kg/month more than the placebo), although it was untested whether such weight loss is maintained.<ref></ref> However, several reports have documented a number of adverse events attributable to unregulated ephedra supplements.<ref></ref>
Adverse effects of ephedra consumption may include severe skin reactions, irritability, nervousness, dizziness, trembling, headache, insomnia, profuse perspiration, dehydration, itchy scalp and skin, vomiting, and hyperthermia. More serious potential side effects include Heart arrhythmia, seizures, heart attack, stroke, and death.<ref></ref>
==Purity and dosage==
There are no formal requirements for standardization or quality control of dietary supplements in the United States, and the dosage of effective ingredients in supplements may vary widely from brand to brand or batch to batch.<ref name="salon"> urltoken "Swallowing Ephedra" , by Sharon Brownlee.

==Regulation in the United States==
Escalating concerns regarding the safety of ephedra supplements led the FDA to ban the sale of supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids (specifically ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norephedrine, and methylephedrine) in the United States in 2004. This ban was challenged by supplement manufacturers and initially overturned, but ultimately upheld.
===Initial concerns and industry response===
In 1997, in response to mounting concern over serious side effects of ephedra, the FDA proposed a ban on products containing 8&nbsp;mg or more of ephedrine alkaloids and stricter labeling of low-dose ephedra supplements. The FDA also proposed that ephedra labels be required to disclose the health risks of ephedra, such as heart attack, stroke, and death.<ref> urltoken "Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids; Proposed Rule" , from the Federal Register, June 4, 1997. Accessed 7 February 2007.</ref>
In response, the supplement industry created a public relations group, the Ephedra Education Council, to oppose the changes, and commissioned a scientific review by a private consulting firm, which reported that ephedra was safe.<ref name="consumerreports"> urltoken "Dangerous supplements: Still at large", from Consumer Reports magazine. Published May 2004, accessed 7 February 2007.</ref> The Ephedra Education Council also attempted to block publication of a study confirming wide discrepancies between the labeled potency of supplements and the actual amount of ephedra in the product.<ref name="salon"/>
Metabolife, makers of the best-selling brand of ephedra supplement, had received over 14,000 complaints of adverse events associated with its product. These reports were not initially provided to the FDA.<ref name="consumerreports"/><ref> urltoken Criminal investigation sought for diet supplement seller, published in USA Today on August 15, 2002.

In addition to the activities of the Ephedra Education Council, Metabolife spent more than $4 million between 1998 and 2000 lobbying against state regulation of ephedra in Texas.<ref name="sciencewolfe"></ref> Business Week reported that efforts to regulate ephedra and other potentially harmful supplements had been "beaten down by deep-pocketed industry lobbying."<ref name="bw"> urltoken "Diet Pills and Pols: A Dangerous Mix" , by Arlene Weintraub and John Carey. Published in Business Week on September 2, 2002. Accessed March 31, 2007.</ref>
In 2000, the FDA withdrew the proposed labeling changes and restrictions.<ref> urltoken "Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids; Withdrawal in Part" , from the Federal Register, April 3, 2000. Accessed 7 February 2007.</ref>
===Additional evidence and deaths===
A review of ephedra-related adverse reactions, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2000, found a number of cases of sudden cardiac death or severe disability resulting from ephedra use, many of which occurred in young adults using ephedra in the labeled dosages.<ref name=Haller_2000 /> Subsequently, in response to pressure from the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen,<ref name="bw"/> Metabolife was compelled by the Department of Justice in 2002 to turn over reports of over 15,000 ephedra-related adverse events, ranging from insomnia to death, which the company had previously withheld from the FDA.<ref name="consumerreports"/><ref name="npr2002"> urltoken "The Secret of Ephedra's Questionable Success".

Steve Bechler, a pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles, died of complications from heatstroke following a spring training workout on February 17, 2003. The medical examiner found that ephedra toxicity played a "significant role" in Bechler's sudden death.<ref> urltoken "Medical examiner: Ephedra a factor in Bechler death", from USA Today, published March 13, 2003. Accessed 7 February 2007.</ref> Following Bechler's death, the FDA re-opened its efforts to regulate ephedra use. According to Bruce Silverglade, legal director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, "All of a sudden after Bechler's death Congress dropped objections to an ephedra ban and started demanding that the FDA act."<ref name="consumerreports"/>
Senator Orrin Hatch (R. Utah), who in 1999 had helped block the FDA's attempts to regulate ephedra, said in March 2003 that ".it has been obvious to even the most casual observer that problems exist", and called FDA action to regulate ephedra "long overdue."<ref name="latimes"/>
===Ephedrine supplement ban===
In response to renewed calls for the regulation of ephedra, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services commissioned a large meta-analysis of ephedra's safety and efficacy by the RAND Corporation. This study found that ephedra promoted modest short-term weight loss, but there was insufficient data to determine whether it was effective for long-term weight loss or performance enhancement. The use of ephedrine alkaloids in this study was associated with significant gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and autonomic side effects.<ref name="rand"></ref> Almost simultaneously, a study in Annals of Internal Medicine found that ephedrine alkaloids were 100 to 700 times more likely to cause a significant adverse reaction than other commonly used supplements such as kava or Ginkgo biloba.<ref name=Bent_2003/>
On December 30, 2003, the FDA issued a press release recommending that consumers stop buying and using products containing ephedrine alkaloids, and indicating its intention to ban the sale of ephedrine alkaloid-containing supplements.<ref> urltoken "FDA Announces Plans to Prohibit Sales of Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedra": Press release from the FDA website, issued December 30, 2003, accessed 7 February 2007.</ref> Subsequently, on April 12, 2004, the FDA issued a final rule banning the sale of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. Tommy Thompson, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, stated that ".These products pose unacceptable health risks, and any consumers who are still using them should stop immediately."<ref name="fdaban"/> Products containing ephedra extract remain legal to this day.<ref name=":0" />
===Legal challenges===
Nutraceutical Corporation, a supplement manufacturer based in Park City, Utah, challenged the legality of the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids as exceeding the authority given the agency by the Dietary Health Supplements and Education Act. Nutraceutical Corporation stated that while they did not intend to restart marketing ephedra, they were concerned about the scope of the FDA's regulatory action. Judge Tena Campbell of the Utah Federal District Court ruled that the FDA had not proven that low doses of ephedra alkaloids were unsafe, although she also noted that studies to address the safety of low-dose ephedra would be unethical. Nevertheless, her ruling overturned the ban on the sale of ephedra alkaloids in the state of Utah, and called into question whether the ban could be enforced anywhere in the United States.<ref name="nytimes"> urltoken "Judge's Decision Lifts Ban On Sale of Ephedra in Utah", from The New York Times, published April 15, 2005. Accessed 7 February 2007.</ref>
The ruling was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver, Colorado. On August 17, 2006, the Appeals Court upheld the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids, finding that the 133,000 page administrative record compiled by the FDA supported the agency's finding that ephedra alkaloids posed an unreasonable risk to consumers.<ref name="fdaappeal"/> Nutraceutical Corp. filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking a rehearing on the ban of ephedra alkaloids; however, on May 14, 2007 the United States Supreme Court declined to hear this petition. The sale of ephedra alkaloid-containing dietary supplements remains illegal in the United States.<ref name="fdamain"/> Sales of products containing ephedra extract not containing ephedrine remain legal.<ref name=":0" />

== Connections to Soma Rituals ==
=== History of Soma ===
It was only two hundred and fifty years ago when western scholars first encountered the Vedas, but these ancient religious texts had been written down around 1500 B.C. and likely existed orally long before that.<ref name=":1">Mahdihassan, S. “Ephedra, the oldest medicinal plant with the history of an uninterrupted use.” Ancient science of life vol. 7,2 (1987): 105-9.</ref> Throughout the many hymns, prayers, and philosophy found in its pages, a mysterious plant is mentioned often and with great reverence. This plant alternates from a holy substance to an actual personified god and is considered a teacher, doctor, medicine, a bringer of insight and a vector of inspiration.<ref name=":2">Houben, Jan. “The Soma-Haoma problem : Introductory overview and observations on the discussion.” Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies, 2003. </ref>  The deity version of Soma was associated with medicinal herbs and the moon and was considered a  bringer of health and prosperity.<ref>Cartwright, Mark. "Soma." Ancient History Encyclopedia. Ancient History Encyclopedia, 30 Jan 2016. Web. 17 Apr 2020.</ref>  The plant was an essential aspect of Vedic religion to alter one’s mind, enabling communion with the divine. The ritual drinking of Soma was also found in the ancient Zoroastrian text, the Avesta.<ref name=":2" />  The rituals and importance of the plant were very similar to those in Vedic culture but were instead called by the name haoma.<ref name=":2" />  It is unknown why, but eventually in both the Vedic and Zoroastrian cultures a substitute substance was used in these religious ceremonies and over time the definitive identity of Soma-Haoma has been lost.  There is much debate over which species is the sacred plant but the most evidence and support from experts in the field show that the identity of Soma was a species of Ephedra.
=== Ritual Use of Ephedra ===
In Hinduism, the Vedic texts show Soma as being not only a plant but also a drink and a deity. The Rigveda is one of the four oldest and most sacred collections of stories in Hinduism. In the Rigveda soma is a drink consumed by two of the main gods; Agni and Indra. In the texts the drink helped the gods in battle by strengthening them physically.<ref>Shah, N.C. “Soma, an Enigmatic, Mysterious Plant of the Vedic Aryas: An Appraisal” Indian Journal of History of Science, vol. 50.1, (2015): 26-4</ref> Because of this, soma was given and consumed by warriors before wartime or a battle. The drink was supposed to give the warriors strength and luck in the upcoming conflict.<ref name=":1" /> Immortality is also a quality associated with soma due to it being a drink of the divine. At religious ceremonies the drink was consumed to give consumers longevity in life. At birth the drink was also given to the babies for these same reasons.<ref name=":1" /> 
In Zoroastrianism the drink is called haoma and has similar uses. Just like in Hinduism, the drink was related to immortality and long life. Haoma was the first thing newborns drank. This assured the child would be healthy and live a long life.<ref name=":1" /> The drink was also administered to people close to death to resurrect them back into good health.<ref name=":1" />
=== Evidence of Ephedra as the identity of Soma ===
Out of the possible identities of Soma one of the main theories is that it is a plant from the Ephedra genus, more specifically Ephedra sinica. Soma and haoma are considered by most to be very similar if not the same drink just with different names due to their differences in religious backgrounds. Both in modern Zoroastrianism and past scriptures the main ingredient of haoma has been plants of the Ephedra genus.<ref name=":1" /> This suggests that its close counterpart soma is also made from the Ephedra plants.
Another reason Ephedra sinica is believed to be the main ingredient in the original soma drink is because of its effects on the body. The genus of plants contains the phytochemical ephedrine. The stimulant increases heart rate as well as blood pressure. It dilates the user's pupils and also relaxes non-essential muscles.<ref name=":3">Brough, John. “Soma and Amanita muscaria.” Cambridge University Press, <nowiki> urltoken     </ref> The drink was given to men before battle and was said to increase their strength and effectiveness on the battlefield. All of these effects of ephedrine would suggest why warriors would feel stronger or more effective on the battlefield. Ephedra would make sense as the ingredient in soma due to its stimulant qualities.<ref name=":3" /> Just like someone today who uses the ephedrine for blood pressure or asthma medication, someone back then who consumed the plant would feel strengthened by it. The effects of soma in the texts are described as that of a stimulant. An example of this is causing people to stay awake throughout the nighttime.<ref name=":2" />  In no way are the effects described as a depressant or hallucinogen. This points to ephedra as being a strong candidate for soma.
The physical appearance of Ephedra is also a reason it is believed to be the soma plant. According to the Vedic text Rigveda, the plant composing soma is shaped like an arrow. Ephedra sinica is a gymnosperm that forms stalks with buds on the end. It is easy to see how this shape could be described like an arrow.<ref name=":1" /> Another text refers to soma as a twig, which is much like Ephedra sinica when it is dried out.<ref name=":2" />
