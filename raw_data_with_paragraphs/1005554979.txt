Brahmin

==Vedic sources==
===Purusha Sukta===
The earliest inferred reference to "Brahmin" as a possible social class is in the Rigveda, occurs once, and the hymn is called Purusha Sukta.<ref>Max Müller, urltoken A History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, Oxford University Press, pages 570–571</ref> According to this hymn in Mandala 10, Brahmins are described as having emerged from the mouth of Purusha, being that part of the body from which words emerge.<ref></ref><ref></ref> This Purusha Sukta varna verse is now generally considered to have been inserted at a later date into the Vedic text, possibly as a Origin myth.<ref name="Jamison 2014 57–58"/> Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton, a professor of Sanskrit and Religious studies, state, "there is no evidence in the Rigveda for an elaborate, much-subdivided and overarching caste system", and "the varna system seems to be embryonic in the Rigveda and, both then and later, a social ideal rather than a social reality".<ref name="Jamison 2014 57–58"></ref>
===Shrauta Sutras===
Ancient texts describing community-oriented Vedic yajna rituals mention four to five priests: the hotar, the adhvaryu, the udgatar, the Brahmin and sometimes the ritvij.<ref>Mahendra Kulasrestha (2007), The Golden Book of Upanishads, Lotus, , page 21</ref><ref name=mohrfear81/> The functions associated with the priests were:
* The Hotri recites invocations and litanies drawn from the Rigveda.<ref name=hume109/>
* The Adhvaryu is the priest's assistant and is in charge of the physical details of the ritual like measuring the ground, building the altar explained in the Yajurveda. The adhvaryu offers oblations.<ref name=hume109>Robert Hume, urltoken Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3.1, Oxford University Press, pages 107–109</ref>
* The Udgatri is the chanter of hymns set to melodies and music (sāman) drawn from the Samaveda. The udgatar, like the hotar, chants the introductory, accompanying and benediction hymns.<ref name=hume109/>
* The Brahmin recites from the Atharvaveda.<ref name=mohrfear81/>
* The Ritvij is the chief operating priest.<ref name=mohrfear81>Mohr and Fear (2015), World Religions: The History, Issues, and Truth, , page 81</ref>
According to Kulkarni, the Grhya-sutras state that Yajna, Adhyayana (studying the vedas and teaching), dana pratigraha (accepting and giving gifts) are the "peculiar duties and privileges of brahmins".<ref></ref>
===Brahmin and renunciation tradition in Hinduism===
The term Brahmin in Indian texts has signified someone who is good and virtuous, not just someone of priestly class.<ref name=olivelleaab60/> Both Buddhist and Brahmanical literature, states Patrick Olivelle, repeatedly define "Brahmin" not in terms of family of birth, but in terms of personal qualities.<ref name=olivelleaab60/> These virtues and characteristics mirror the values cherished in Hinduism during the Sannyasa stage of life, or the life of renunciation for spiritual pursuits. Brahmins, states Olivelle, were the social class from which most ascetics came.<ref name=olivelleaab60>Patrick Olivelle (2011), Ascetics and Brahmins: Studies in Ideologies and Institutions, Anthem, , page 60</ref>
==Dharmasutras and Dharmashastras==
The Dharmasutras and Dharmasatras text of Hinduism describe the expectations, duties and role of Brahmins. The rules and duties in these Dharma texts of Hinduism, are primarily directed at Brahmins. The Gautama's Dharmasutra, the oldest of surviving Hindu Dharmasutras, for example, states in verse 9.54–9.55 that a Brahmin should not participate or perform a ritual unless he is invited to do so, but he may attend. Gautama outlines the following rules of conduct for a Brahmin, in Chapters 8 and 9:<ref>RC Prasad (2014), The Upanayana: The Hindu Ceremonies of the Sacred Thread</ref>
Modern scholars state that such usage of the term Brahmin in ancient texts does not imply a caste, but simply "masters" (experts), guardian, recluse, preacher or guide of any tradition.<ref name="Jaini2001p123"/><ref name="Jayatilleke2013"></ref><ref></ref> An alternate synonym for Brahmin in the Buddhist and other non-Hindu tradition is Mahano.<ref name="Jaini2001p123"></ref>
==Outside India: Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia==
Some Brahmins formed an influential group in Burmese Buddhist kingdoms in 18th- and 19th-century. The court Brahmins were locally called Punna.<ref name="leider"/> During the Konbaung dynasty, Buddhist kings relied on their court Brahmins to consecrate them to kingship in elaborate ceremonies, and to help resolve political questions.<ref name="leider"></ref> This role of Hindu Brahmins in a Buddhist kingdom, states Leider, may have been because Hindu texts provide guidelines for such social rituals and political ceremonies, while Buddhist texts do not.<ref name="leider"/>
The Brahmins were also consulted in the transmission, development and maintenance of law and justice system outside India.<ref name="leider"/> Hindu Dharmasastras, particularly Manusmriti written by the Brahmin Manu, states Anthony Reid,<ref name=reidseasia/> were "greatly honored in Burma (Myanmar), Siam (Thailand), Cambodia and Java-Bali (Indonesia) as the defining documents of law and order, which kings were obliged to uphold. They were copied, translated and incorporated into local law code, with strict adherence to the original text in Burma and Siam, and a stronger tendency to adapt to local needs in Java (Indonesia)".<ref name=reidseasia>Anthony Reid (1988), Southeast Asia in the Age of Commerce, 1450–1680: The lands below the winds, Yale University Press, , pages 137–138</ref><ref>Victor Lieberman (2014), Burmese Administrative Cycles, Princeton University Press, , pages 66–68; Also see discussion of 13th century Wagaru Dhamma-sattha / 11th century Manu Dhammathat manuscripts discussion</ref><ref>On Laws of Manu in 14th century Thailand's Ayuthia kingdom named after Ayodhya, see David Wyatt (2003), Thailand: A Short History, Yale University Press, , page 61;<br>Robert Lingat (1973), The Classical Law of India, University of California Press, , pages 269–272</ref>
The mythical origins of Cambodia are credited to a Brahmin prince named Kaundinya, who arrived by sea, married a Naga princess living in the flooded lands.<ref name=trevorranges48/><ref>Jonathan Lee and Kathleen Nadeau (2010), Encyclopedia of Asian American Folklore and Folklife, Volume 1, ABC, , page 1223</ref> Kaudinya founded Kambuja-desa, or Kambuja (transliterated to Kampuchea or Cambodia). Kaundinya introduced Hinduism, particularly Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and Harihara (half Vishnu, half Shiva), and these ideas grew in southeast Asia in the 1st millennium CE.<ref name=trevorranges48>Trevor Ranges (2010), Cambodia, National Geographic, , page 48</ref>

Brahmins have been part of the Royal tradition of Thailand, particularly for the consecration and to mark annual land fertility rituals of Buddhist kings. A small Brahmanical temple Devasathan, established in 1784 by King Rama I of Thailand, has been managed by ethnically Thai Brahmins ever since.<ref name=wales54/> The temple hosts Phra Phikhanesuan (Ganesha), Phra Narai (Narayana, Vishnu), Phra Itsuan (Shiva), Uma, Brahma, Indra (Sakka) and other Hindu deities.<ref name=wales54>HG Quadritch Wales (1992), urltoken Siamese State Ceremonies, Curzon Press, , pages 54–63</ref> The tradition asserts that the Thai Brahmins have roots in Hindu holy city of Varanasi and southern state of Tamil Nadu, go by the title Pandita, and the various annual rites and state ceremonies they conduct has been a blend of Buddhist and Hindu rituals. The coronation ceremony of the Thai king is almost entirely conducted by the royal Brahmins.<ref name=wales54/><ref>Boreth Ly (2011), Early Interactions Between South and Southeast Asia (Editors: Pierre-Yves Manguin, A.

==Modern demographics and economic condition==
According to 2007 reports, Brahmins in India are about five percent of its total population.<ref name="bellmanwsj">Eric Bellman, urltoken Reversal of Fortune Isolates India's Brahmins, The Wall Street Journal (29 December 2007)</ref><ref name="outlookbgraph"></ref> The Himalayan states of Uttarakhand (20%) and Himachal Pradesh (14%) have the highest percentage of Brahmin population relative to respective state's total Hindus.<ref name="outlookbgraph" /> 
According to the Center for the Study of Developing Societies, in 2007 about 50% of Brahmin households in India earned less than $100 a month; in 2004, this figure was 65%.<ref>Eric Bellman, urltoken Reversal of Fortune Isolates India's Brahmins, Wall street Journal (December 29, 2007).</ref>
