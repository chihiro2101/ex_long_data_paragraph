HMS Ocean (L12)

==Role==
Ocean was designed to provide the amphibious assault capabilities last offered by and . She can deploy an Embarked Military Force (EMF) of a Royal Marines battalion from 3 Commando Brigade supported by aircraft and landing craft. The ship's company included 9 Assault Squadron (9 ASRM) from 1 Assault Group Royal Marines whose primary role is as an Amphibious Assault Squadron. Secondary tasks include boarding parties, beach reconnaissance and providing amphibious knowledge to the ships Command. Besides these roles they have responsibilities within the ship which include firefighting, watchkeeping and security. 9 ASRM is divided into a HQ unit, Landing Craft Troop, Signals detachment, Vehicle Deck Party and Assault Supply Team.<ref>RN Publication 15/370</ref>
HMS Ocean was also capable of limited anti-submarine warfare activities, supporting afloat training and acting as a base facility for other embarked forces including counter-terrorism units.
The ship was capable of carrying four to six Apache AH1 helicopters operated by the Army Air Corps, as well as helicopters of the Royal Air Force, including the larger twin-rotor Chinook. Prior to their retirement, Ocean could transport up to fifteen fixed-wing Harrier<ref></ref> aircraft of Joint Force Harrier in the ferry role, but was unable to operate as a fixed-wing aircraft carrier because she lacked the ski jump that is needed to launch a fully loaded Harrier.
For the 2012 London Olympics, she carried four Army Air Corps and four Fleet Air Arm Super Lynx helicopters, to deploy special forces and conduct other missions in a security role.<ref></ref>
Four LCVP_(United_Kingdom) (LCVPs) were permanently embarked and manned by 9 Assault Squadron Royal Marines.<ref></ref>
==Operational history==
===1998–2000===
Weeks after being commissioned, Ocean was undertaking the warm water element of her first-of-class trials, when she was deployed on short notice to the coasts of Honduras and Nicaragua to provide Humanitarian aid in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch.<ref></ref> In early 1999, Ocean was scheduled to take part in an exercise in the Atlantic, but was diverted to the Mediterranean in readiness for possible deployment to Kosovo.<ref></ref>
During 2000, Ocean supported Operation Palliser in Sierra Leone, joining in aiding the suppression of rebel activity with her own embarked force, and providing support facilities for the Spearhead battalion ashore.<ref></ref>
===2001–2010===
On 17 February 2002, whilst under command of Captain Adrian Johns, a unit of Royal Marines from Ocean accidentally landed on the San Felipe beach in the Spanish town of La Linea instead of Gibraltar, causing a minor diplomatic incident as various media outlets labelled the mistake as an "invasion".<ref></ref>
Ocean was part of a large Royal Navy task force deployed for Operation Telic, the UK contribution to the 2003 Iraq War, for which she was awarded a new battle honour "Al Faw 2003".<ref></ref> In the helicopter assault role she was accompanied by .
She was awarded the Freedom of the City of Sunderland on 26 July 2004.<ref> urltoken 
In the summer of 2006, under the command of Captain Christopher Clayton, the ship was deployed as part of the task force involved in the Aurora exercises on the eastern seaboard of the United States. Clayton was later succeeded by Captain Tony Johnstone-Burt.
In 2007, Ocean began her first long refit period. This was carried out by Devonport Management Limited at their Devonport Royal Dockyard facility and lasted around 12 months. Following this major period of maintenance and upgrading work, Ocean sailed from Plymouth on Wednesday 24 September 2008 to start sea trials.<ref></ref> As part of that upgrade, a PyTEC pyrolysising waste recycling unit was fitted.<ref></ref>
On 18 February 2009, Ocean sailed from Devonport as part of the Taurus 09 deployment. She was joined on this deployment by the landing platform dock , as the flagship of the group, which included Type 23 Frigates and and four ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.<ref></ref> This exercise was filmed for the second series of the Channel 5 documentary Warship.
In June 2009, Ocean took part in exercise Bersama Shield with and off the Malay Peninsula.<ref></ref>
During the air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption, Prime Minister Gordon Brown assigned Ocean and other units to rescue stranded travellers and army personnel across the English Channel in Operation Cunningham.<ref></ref>
In 2010, the ship was sent on a multi-purpose deployment. This started with exercise Auriga on the eastern coast of the USA.<ref></ref> She then moved to Brazil to conduct an exercise with the Brazilian marines; whilst there a defence co-operation agreement was signed on board.<ref></ref> She then crossed the Atlantic to Nigeria to participate in the "Nigeria at 50" presidential fleet review and provide training to the Nigerian navy as part of the African partnership programme.<ref></ref><ref></ref> She returned to Devonport in November.<ref></ref>
===2011–2018===
In April 2011, while under command of Captain Keith Blount, the ship took part in the COUGAR 11 deployment under the ultimate command of Commander Amphibious Task Group. During this deployment, she took part in Exercise Cypriot Lion.<ref></ref>
In May 2011, she was detached from CATG's COUGAR 11 deployment and sent with embarked Apaches to aid operations in Libya along with the attack helicopters aboard the French amphibious assault ship Tonnerre.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> This was the first time that Apache helicopters were sent directly into action from a Royal Navy ship.<ref></ref> Her initial complement of three Apaches was bolstered by a fourth soon after,<ref></ref> and later a fifth.<ref></ref> The deployment included a large medical team, a sign of the ship's flexibility.<ref></ref>
On 4 May 2012, she moored at Greenwich to prepare for her role of providing logistics support, accommodation and a helicopter landing site during the London 2012 Olympic Games.<ref></ref> From 24 to 28 May 2012, she visited Sunderland, her affiliated port, and made other port calls<ref></ref> before returning to London on 13 July.<ref></ref> After Olympic duty, Ocean returned to her home port of HMNB Devonport for a scheduled period of maintenance.<ref></ref> The LPH role was provided by until 2014.

As part of the Response Force Task Group COUGAR 14 deployment, Ocean participated in exercises off Albania and France.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
In April 2015 Ocean took part in Exercise Joint Warrior 15-1 around the coast of Scotland,<ref></ref> with Wildcat helicopters landing on her for the first time.<ref></ref> She then stopped again in Sunderland where the ship's company exercised their right to the freedom of the city, with more than 300 officers and ratings parading through the city centre.<ref></ref>
Ocean became the Royal Navy Fleet Flagship in June 2015.<ref name=flagship/><ref></ref> In December 2015, she returned to port after Exercise COUGAR 15, an amphibious warfare exercise in the Mediterranean with the French Navy.<ref></ref>
In September 2016, Ocean left Devonport for the inaugural Joint Expeditionary Force (Maritime) (JEF(M)) Task Group deployment which is the successor to the annual Cougar deployments. The bulk of this deployment took place East of Suez and demonstrated the Uk's ongoing ability to deploy highly effective and combat capable maritime forces anywhere in the world.<ref name=RN1></ref>
The core task group included the LSD RFA Mount's Bay, MOD strategic Ro-Ro vessel MV Eddystone and HMS Bulwark. Elements of the Royal Marines lead Commando Unit, based around 42 Commando, were spread across the force. Frigates and Destroyers from the Royal Navy and French Navy joined throughout the deployment.<ref name=RN1 />
On the 60th anniversary of Op Musketeer, Ocean became the flagship of COMATG. This marked the end of the JEF(M) deployment. 
On 25 November, the ship rendezvoused with . COMATG assumed command of the U.S. Task Force 50,<ref> urltoken becoming Commander, Task Force 50 (CTF 50). Due to the U.S. Navy gap in carrier coverage in the Middle East, this was the first time a Royal Navy vessel had commanded the US formation responsible for maritime war fighting in the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Gulfs of Aden and Oman and the Indian Ocean. On 24 March Ocean returned to Devonport. During the deployment she steamed 23,000 miles, visited 11 countries, provided a platform for six British ambassadors and High Commissioners and was home to up to 1150 service personnel.

in ,, comparable to that of a Type 23 frigate. VSEL, a warship manufacturer, sub-contracted the build phase to the commercial Kværner yard in Govan, Glasgow.
That VSEL's bid was £71&nbsp;million lower than Swan Hunter's was the source of political controversy and led to a National Audit Office investigation to determine whether the competition was fair. The report, published on 29 July 1993, stated that, although VSEL did subsidise its bid, the MoD was right to award the contract to VSEL because the subsidy was much smaller than the difference between the two bids; VSEL's bid was £139.5&nbsp;million compared to Swan Hunter's £210.6&nbsp;million. The Times also suggested that the subsidy was as little as £10&nbsp;million.<ref></ref> In anticipation of the report, the Financial Times described the different philosophies adopted by the two bidders; while Swan Hunter viewed the ship as entirely military, "VSEL thought the design was basically a merchant ship with military hardware bolted on." VSEL's decision to sub-contract the build phase took advantage of lower overheads at a civilian yard as well as efficiency drives by its parent, Kværner.<ref></ref>
