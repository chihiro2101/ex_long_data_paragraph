Baphomet

==History==
The name Baphomet appeared in July 1098 in a letter by the Crusades Anselm of Ribemont:
For Crowley, Baphomet is further a representative of the spiritual nature of the spermatozoa, while also being symbolic of the "magical child" produced as a result of sex magic.<ref></ref> As such, Baphomet represents the Union of Opposites, especially as mystically personified in Chaos and Babalon combined and biologically manifested with the sperm and egg united in the zygote.
Crowley proposed that Baphomet was derived from "Father Mithras". In his Confessions he describes the circumstances that led to this etymology:<ref></ref>
==Modern interpretations and usage==
Lévi's Baphomet is the source of the later tarot image of the Devil in the Rider-Waite design.<ref name=Waite>Waite, urltoken Class I, §2: "Since 1856 the influence of Eliphas Lévi and his doctrine of occultism has changed the face of this card, and it now appears as a pseudo-Baphometic figure with the head of a goat and a great torch between the horns; it is seated instead of erect, and in place of the generative organs there is the Hermetic caduceus."</ref> The concept of a downward-pointing pentagram on its forehead was enlarged upon by Lévi in his discussion (without illustration) of the Goat of Mendes arranged within such a pentagram, which he contrasted with the microcosmic man arranged within a similar but upright pentagram.<ref>Lévi, urltoken pp. 93–98: ""</ref> The actual image of a goat in a downward-pointing pentagram first appeared in the 1897 book , written by the French occultist Stanislas de Guaita.<ref name=Strube/><ref name=Guaita/> It was this image that was later adopted as the official symbol—called the Sigil of Baphomet—of the Church of Satan, and continues to be used among Satanists.<ref name="churchofsatan.com"></ref>

Baphomet, as Lévi's illustration suggests, has occasionally been portrayed as a synonym of Satan or a demon, a member of the hierarchy of Hell. Baphomet appears in that guise as a character in James Blish's The Day After Judgment.<ref>Ketterer, David (1987). Imprisoned in a tesseract: The Life and Work of James Blish. Kent State University Press. .</ref> Christian evangelist Jack T. Chick claimed that Baphomet is a demon worshipped by Freemasons,<ref></ref> a claim that apparently originated with the Taxil hoax. Léo Taxil's elaborate hoax employed a version of Lévi's Baphomet on the cover of , his lurid paperback "exposé" of Freemasonry, which in 1897 he revealed as a hoax intended to ridicule the Catholic Church and its anti-Masonic propaganda.<ref> urltoken "Leo Taxil's confession".</ref><ref></ref>
In 2014, The Satanic Temple commissioned an statue of Baphomet to stand alongside a Oklahoma State Capitol#Monument controversy,<ref></ref> citing "respect for diversity and religious minorities" as reasons for erecting the monument.<ref></ref> After the Ten Commandments monument was vandalized, plans to erect the Baphomet statue were put on hold, as the Satanic Temple did not want their statue to stand alone by the Oklahoma capitol.<ref></ref> The Oklahoma Supreme Court declared all religious displays illegal,<ref></ref> and on 25 July 2015 the statue was erected near a warehouse in Detroit, as a symbol of the modern Satanist movement.<ref></ref><ref name=statue2></ref> On August 16, 2018 the Satanic Temple unveiled a Baphomet statue in Little Rock, Arkansas, where another 10 Commandments monument had been installed in 2017, citing the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.<ref></ref>
Baphomet appears in Dungeons & Dragons as a powerful demon lord and is also known as the "Horned King", or the "Prince of Beasts". Baphomet is followed by minotaurs and other savage creatures. He desires the end of civilizations so all creatures may embrace their most basic, brutal instincts. He is described as a massive, black minotaur, with blood around his mouth and red eyes. He wears an iron crown topped with the heads of his enemies, along with spiked armor. He wields a huge glaive, named "Heartcleaver", but commonly fights with his hooves, claws, and horns. He rules of the 600th layer of The Abyss, known as the "Endless Maze", and is the sworn enemy of Yeenoghu, another demon lord.
Baphomet also serves as the main antagonist in the PC game Tristania 3D and is the worshipped deity of the evil Courbée Dominate society. The game's storyline describes in depth that in fact Philip&nbsp;IV of France was the one who had worshipped Baphomet, not the Knights Templar, and he deliberately eradicated the entire order to make sure that this secret would remain undiscovered. In the last level, the protagonist must enter the afterlife to seek out and defeat Baphomet, however, he is protected by the shadows of his fallen worshippers in the previous levels, along with the ghost of Evil Empress and the protagonist's former accomplice, Evil Twirl. The game depicts Baphomet very close to the original, except that it has a male torso and dragon-like wings, as opposed to feathered ones. Baphomet's main attack is a lethal wall of fire, which causes severe damage and can be manifested in rapid successions. Baphomet also can turn himself invisible during his attack periods. Successfully defeating him will win the game, albeit it is noted that defeating him does not mean that he is killed.
An interpretation of Baphomet, referred to as The Sword of Baphomet, forms part of the main plot in the 1996 point-and-click adventure game Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars developed by Revolution Software. It is the first game in the Broken Sword series. The player assumes the role of George Stobbart, an American tourist in Paris, as he attempts to unravel a conspiracy, much of which is influenced by and includes factual and fictional references and narrative devices relating to the history of the Knights Templar.
In the 2005 puzzle-Metroidvania La-Mulana and its 2012 remake, Baphomet appears as the boss of the Twin Labyrinths.
In the popular PC video game Doom II: Hell on Earth, in the final mission "Icon of Sin", the titular antagonist has a look similar to that of early depictions of Baphomet.
In July 2015, YouTube star and singer Poppy depicted the deity in the music video for her single "Lowlife". Poppy can be seen imitating the famous pose of Baphomet.
The 2018 Netflix series Chilling Adventures of Sabrina has a large statue of Baphomet displayed at the Academy of Unseen Arts. The Satanic Temple has accused the show of plagiarizing their depiction of Baphomet, though later settled out of court.<ref></ref>
In the video game Doom Eternal, in the final mission "Final Sin", the Icon of Sin has a resemblance to early depictions of Baphomet.
Iannis Stamatakos has pointed out that the name Baphomet, when interpreted through the universal transliteration of the letters with the Greek, is a basic atbash crypt, which splits the word in the middle and places the last part to the beginning of the word, spelling the word "Metapho(R)", with the letter B inserted to add complexity.
In the 2019 film Godzilla: King of the Monsters, "Titanus Baphomet" is the name of one of the Titans/Kaiju listed by MONARCH.
In Doom Patrol, "Baphomet" is the name of a supernatural oracle who can be summoned by Niles Caulder. Having no fixed form, she can assume what-ever form she fancies, currently using the form of "Falada", a magical horse from the fairytale, "The Goose Girl".
