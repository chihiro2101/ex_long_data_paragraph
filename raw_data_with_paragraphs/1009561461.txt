The Jerusalem Post

==History==
==="The Jerusalem News"===
The first attempt to establish an English-language newspaper in Jerusalem was "The Jerusalem News", established in 1919 under the auspices of the Christian Science movement . William Denison McCrackan, the associated editor of both the Christian Science Journal and Christian Science Sentinel , was critical of the Zionist slogan "a land without a people for a people without a land". He said, "We used to read in our papers the slogan of Zionism, 'to give back a people to a Land without a People,' while the truth was that Palestine was already well-peopled with a population which was rapidly increasing from natural causes."<ref>Muir, Diana. urltoken "A Land without a People for a People without a Land" Middle East Forum, republished from the Middle East Quarterly (Spring 2008). Retrieved June 15, 2013</ref>. Following the conquest of Palestine by the British Army in 1917, Christian Science interested itself in the affairs of Palestine, first organizing relief work and then with starting a new newspaper. The Jerusalem News paper was originally established in 1919 by Elizabeth Lippincott McQueen, a British-American woman who would later become a women's aeronautics pioneer, and who had in the aftermath of WWI served in war relief work in Palestine under Field Marshal Allenby<ref name=Claremont></ref>. The first issue, on Dec. 9, 1919, bore a congratulatory message from Allenby, then High Commissioner for Egypt <ref>Summary of first issue provided in reference to a copy being auctioned in 2014 by House of Zion urltoken In February 1920 the British-American writer and journalist Talbot Mundy - McCrackan's co-worker and personal friend - arrived in Jerusalem <ref></ref>.There he became The Jerusalem News' editorial assistant, being involved in writing articles, reporting on current events, proof reading, and editing. Talbot witnessed the increasing conflict between Arab and Jewish populations within the city, and was present during the Nebi Musa riots. McCrackan was a contributor, though not physically present in Palestine.

There was no continuity between this short-lived paper and what would later become "The Jerusalem Post".
===1925–1950===
The direct journalistic ancestry of The Jerusalem Post can be traced to The Palestine Bulletin, which was founded in January 1925 by Jacob Landau of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.<ref name=Birnhack></ref> It was owned by the Palestine Telegraphic Agency, which was in practice part of the JTA even though it was legally separate.<ref name=Birnhack/> On 1 November 1931, editorship of the Bulletin was taken over by Gershon Agronsky (later Agron), a Jewish journalist who had immigrated to Palestine from the United States.<ref>Palestine Bulletin, 31 October 1931.</ref> In March 1932, a dispute arose between Landau and Agronsky, which Agronsky resolved to settle by establishing an independent newspaper.<ref name=Birnhack/> However, Landau and Agronsky instead came to an agreement to transform the Bulletin into a new jointly owned newspaper.<ref name=Birnhack/> Accordingly, the Palestine Bulletin published its last issue on 30 November 1932 and The Palestine Post Incorporating The Palestine Bulletin appeared the following day, 1 December 1932.<ref name=Birnhack/> On 25 April 1933, the masthead was reduced to just The Palestine Post, though the newspaper continued to state its founding year as 1925 for at least a year afterwards.<ref>Palestine Post, 25 April 1993 and 25 August 1934.</ref>
During its time as The Palestine Post, the publication supported the struggle for a Jewish homeland in Palestine and openly opposed British policy restricting aliyah during the Mandate period. According to one commentator, "Zionist institutions considered the newspaper one of the most effective means of exerting influence on the British authorities."<ref>Wilson, Cynthia: urltoken Attributed to Penslar D. at footnote, p. 34, Always Something New to Discover: Menahem Pressler and the Beaux Arts Trio, Paragon Publishing 2011, accessed at Google Books, 5 August 2014</ref>
====1948 bombing====
On the evening of 1 February 1948, a stolen British police car loaded with half a ton of TNT pulled up in front of the Jerusalem office of the Palestine Post; the driver of a second car arrived a few minutes later, lit the fuse and drove off.<ref name="google1948"></ref> The building also contained other newspaper offices, the British press censor, the Jewish settlement police, and a Haganah post with a cache of weapons. Arab leader Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni claimed responsibility for the bombing, but historian Uri Milstein reported that the bomb had been prepared by the Nazi-trained Fawzi el-Kutub, known as "the engineer", with the involvement of two British army desertion, Cpl. Peter Mersden and Capt. Eddie Brown.<ref>Uri Milstein, History of Israel's War of Independence, Vol III (English edition: University Press of America, 1997, , pages 105–107.</ref><ref></ref> Three persons died in the bombing, a newspaper typesetter and two people who lived in a nearby block of flats.<ref>The Palestine Post, 5 February 1948, p3.</ref> Dozens of others were injured and the printing press was destroyed.

==Ownership changes==
Until 1989, the paper supported the forerunners of the Labor Party. In 1989, the paper was purchased by Hollinger Inc., owned by Conrad Black. A number of journalists resigned from the Post after Black's takeover and founded The Jerusalem Report, a weekly magazine eventually sold to the Post.
Under editor-in-chief David Makovsky, from 1999 to 2000, the paper took a centrist position on defense, but began to reject socialism.<ref name="Judaica"/> In 2002, Hollinger hired the politically conservative Bret Stephens of The Wall Street Journal as editor-in-chief. David Horovitz took over as editor-in-chief on 1 October 2004,<ref name=Balint>Anat Balint, urltoken Jlem Post change of editors , Haaretz, 5 Sep. 2004</ref> returning the paper to a centrist position.<ref></ref> On 16 November 2004, Hollinger sold the paper to Mirkaei Tikshoret Limited, a Tel Aviv-based publisher of Israeli newspapers. CanWest Global Communications, Canada's biggest media concern, had announced an agreement to take a 50 percent stake in The Jerusalem Post after Mirkaei bought the property, but the deal soured. The two sides went to arbitration, and CanWest lost.<ref></ref>
In 2011, Horovitz was succeeded by the paper's managing editor, Steve Linde, who professed to maintain political moderation and balance.<ref></ref> Yaakov Katz, the paper's former military analyst and a fellow at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism, succeeded Linde in April 2016.
