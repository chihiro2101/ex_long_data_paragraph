Garamond

==Characteristics==
Some distinctive characteristics in Garamond's letterforms are an 'e' with a small eye and the bowl of the 'a' which has a sharp turn at top left.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science: Claude Garamond"></ref> Other general features are limited but clear stroke contrast and capital letters on the model of Roman square capitals. The 'M' is slightly splayed with outward-facing serifs at the top (sometimes only on the left) and the leg of the 'R' extends outwards from the letter. The x-height (height of lower-case letters) is low, especially at larger sizes, making the capitals large relative to the lower case, while the top serifs on the ascenders of letters like 'd' have a downward slope and ride above the cap height.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science: Claude Garamond" /> The axis of letters like the ‘o’ is diagonal and the bottom right of the italic 'h' bends inwards. 
Besides general characteristics, writers on type have generally praised the even quality of Garamond's type: John A. Lane describes his work as "elegant and executed with consummate skill.to a higher standard than commercial interest demanded"; H. D. L. Vervliet wrote that in his later Gros-Canon and Parangonne types (meaning Traditional point-size names respectively) he had achieved "a culmination of Renaissance design. The elegant line and subdued emphasis show the classic search for silent and transparent form".<ref name="Vervliet Garamond Types"></ref>
Modern Garamond revivals also often add a matching bold and 'lining' numbers at the height of capital letters, neither of which were used during the Renaissance;<ref name="Bold type in text"></ref> Arabic numerals in Garamond's time were engraved as what are now called text figures, styled with variable height like lower-case letters.<ref name="Lawson NYTimes"></ref>
==History==
===Garamond’s life and his roman type===
Garamond worked as an engraver of punches, the masters used to stamp matrices, the moulds used to cast metal type. Garamond cut types in the Roman type, in italic, and Greek.
While ATF's handset foundry type release was initially popular, the design became particularly known to later users under the name of "Garamond No. 3”, as a hot metal adaptation that was licensed to Linotype's American branch and sold from around 1936. More practical to use than ATF's handset foundry type, the number distinguished it from two versions of Stempel Garamond which Linotype also sold.<ref name="The Mystery of Garamond No. 3"></ref><ref></ref> It was the preferred Garalde font of prominent designer Massimo Vignelli.<ref></ref>
Several digitisations have been made of both ATF's original Garamond and the Linotype adaptation, most notably a 2015 digitisation by van Bronkhorst with optical sizes and the original swash characters.<ref name="ATF Collection: Garamond"></ref><ref name="Review: ATF Garamond"></ref> A loose adaptation with sans-serif companion by Christian Schwartz is the corporate font of Deutsche Bahn.<ref></ref>

====Monotype Garamond====
Monotype's 1922-3 design, based on Jannon's work in the Imprimerie Nationale, is bundled with many Microsoft products.<ref name="Save $400M printing cost from font change? Not so fast…" /><ref></ref> Its italic, faithful to Jannon's, is extremely calligraphic, with a variable angle of slant and flourishes on several lower-case letters.<ref></ref> Its commercial release is more extensive than the basic Microsoft release, including additional features such as swash capitals and small capitals, although like many pre-digital fonts these are only included in the regular weight. Popular in the metal type era, its digitisation has been criticised for having too light a colour on the page for body text if printed with many common printing systems, a problem with several Monotype digitisations of the period.<ref></ref><ref name="Rafaeli"></ref><ref></ref><ref name="On book design"></ref><ref name="Williamson Adobe Garamond" /> Monotype's 1933 guide to identifying their typefaces noted the asymmetrical T, the sharp triangular serif at top left of m, n, p and r, and a q unlike the p, with a point at top right rather than a full serif.<ref name="Recognising Garamond MT"></ref>
Monotype's artistic advisor Stanley Morison wrote in his memoir that the italic was based on Granjon's work, but as Carter's commentary on it notes, this seems generally to be a mistake.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science: Claude Garamond" /> The swash capitals, however, at least, probably are based on the work of Granjon.<ref name="Review: A Tally of Types"></ref> A 1959 publicity design promoting it was created by a young Rodney Peppé.<ref name="Peppé"></ref>
====Garamont====
A revival by Frederic Goudy for the American branch of Monotype, the name chosen to differ from other revivals.<ref name="Goudy autobiog"></ref><ref name="Shaw on Goudy"></ref> An elegant sample created by Bruce Rogers was shown in a spring 1923 issue of Monotype's magazine.<ref></ref> It, like Monotype Garamond, features a large range of swash characters, based on Imprimerie Nationale specimen sheets.
Mosley has described it as "a lively type, underappreciated I think."<ref name="Mosley on Typophile"></ref> LTC's digitisation deliberately maintained its eccentricity and irregularity true to period printing, avoiding perfect verticals.<ref name="LTC Garamont"></ref> In 1923, Morison at the British branch of Monotype thought it somewhat florid in comparison to the version of his branch which he considered a personal project, noting in a 1923 letter to American printer Daniel Berkeley Updike that "I entertain very decided opinions about this latest of Mr. Goudy's achievements&nbsp;. a comparison leaves me with a preference for our version." He added that he "could not bring myself to believe" that Garamond himself had cut the swash capitals that "Mr. Goudy has done his best to reproduce".<ref name="Stanley Morison & D.B. Updike: Selected Correspondence on Monotype Garamonds"></ref>
====Simoncini Garamond====
A 1950s version following Jannon by the Simoncini of Italy, owned by Francesco Simoncini, which sold matrices for Linotype machines.<ref name="Behind Simoncini’s Glasses"></ref> It is particularly popular in Italian printing.
====Jannon====
František Štorm's 2010 revival with optical sizes is one of the few modern revivals of Jannon's work.<ref name="Jannon Pro"></ref><ref name="Storm Jannon specimen"></ref> Štorm also created a matching sans-serif companion design, Jannon Sans.<ref name="Jannon Sans"></ref>
===Related fonts===
As one of the most popular typefaces in history, a number of designs have been created that are influenced by Garamond's design but follow different design paths.
====ITC Garamond====
ITC Garamond was created by Tony Stan in 1975, and follows ITC's house style of unusually high x-height. It was initially intended to serve as a display version but has been used for text, in which its tight spacing and high x-height gives it a somewhat hectoring appearance.<ref name="Just what makes a Garamond a Garamond?" /> As a result, it has proven somewhat controversial among designers; it is generally considered poorly proportioned for body text.<ref name="Fonts & Encodings" /><ref></ref><ref name="Seventy-nine short essays on design"></ref> It remains the corporate font of the California State University system in printed text.<ref name="Serif Type Family: ITC Garamond"></ref> As seen below, it was also modified into Apple Garamond which served as Apple's corporate font from 1984 until replacement starting in 2002 with Myriad. Publishers using it included O'Reilly Media and French publisher Actes Sud.<ref name="Fonts & Encodings"></ref><ref name="Le Garamond dans l’édition contemporaine"></ref><ref></ref>
====Cormorant====
An open-source adaptation of Garamond intended for display sizes, designed by Christian Thalmann and co-released with Google Fonts.<ref name="This Month in Typography: September 2015"></ref><ref name="best free typefaces of 2015"></ref> It features a delicate style suitable for printing at larger sizes, and considerable contrast in stroke weight in its larger sizes. Thalmann added several unusual alternate designs such as an upright italic and unicase styles, as well as exaggerated, highly slanting accents.<ref name="Cormorant Behance"></ref><ref name="Christian Thalmann fonts page"></ref>
====Sans-serif designs====
Several sans-serif typefaces have been published that are based on the proportions of Garamond-style fonts, both as standalone designs or as part of a font superfamily with matching serif and sans-serif fonts.<ref name="Human Side of Sans Serif" /> One example is Claude Sans, a humanist sans-serif based on the letterforms of Jannon's type, created by Alan Meeks and published by Letraset and later ITC.<ref name="Human Side of Sans Serif"></ref><ref name="Claude Sans"></ref>

===Printer ink claim===
It has been claimed that Garamond uses much less ink than Times New Roman at a similar point size, so changing to Garamond could be a cost-saver for large organizations that print large numbers of documents, especially if using inkjet printers.<ref>Stix, Madeleine (28 March 2014). urltoken Teen to gov't: change your typeface, save millions. CNN via KOCO-TV. Retrieved 28 March 2014.</ref><ref></ref> Garamond, along with Times New Roman and Century Gothic, has been identified by the GSA as a "toner-efficient" font.<ref></ref>
This claim has been criticised as a misinterpretation of how typefaces are actually measured and what printing methods are desirable. Monotype Garamond, the version bundled with Microsoft Windows, has a generally smaller design at the same nominal point size compared to Times New Roman and quite spindly strokes, giving it a more elegant but less readable appearance. To make letters, especially the lower-case, as high as in an equivalent setting of Times New Roman, the text size must be increased, counterbalancing any cost savings. Thomas Phinney, an expert on digital fonts, noted that the effect of simply swapping Garamond in would be compromised legibility: "any of those changes, swapping to a font that sets smaller at the same nominal point size, or actually reducing the point size, or picking a thinner typeface, will reduce the legibility of the text. That seems like a bad idea, as the percentage of Americans with poor eyesight is skyrocketing."<ref name="Save $400M printing cost from font change? Not so fast…"></ref> Professional type designer Jackson Cavanaugh commented "If we're actually interested in reducing waste, just printing less – using less paper – is obviously more efficient."<ref name="Ask a designer: why switching fonts won’t save the US government millions"></ref>

Garamond is a group of many serif typefaces, named for sixteenth-century Parisian engraver Claude Garamond, generally spelled as Garamont in his lifetime. Garamond-style typefaces are popular and particularly often used for book printing and body text.
Garamond's types followed the model of an influential typeface cut for Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by his punchcutter Francesco Griffo in 1495, and are in what is now called the old-style of serif letter design, letters with a relatively organic structure resembling handwriting with a pen, but with a slightly more structured, upright design.
Following an eclipse in popularity in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, many modern revival faces in the Garamond style have been developed. It is common to pair these with italics based on those created by his contemporary Robert Granjon, who was well known for his proficiency in this genre.<ref name="Just what makes a Garamond a Garamond?"></ref> However, although Garamond himself remains considered a major figure in French printing of the sixteenth century, historical research has increasingly placed him in context as one artisan punchcutter among many active at a time of rapid production of new typefaces in sixteenth-century France, and research has only slowly developed into which fonts were cut by him and which by contemporaries; Robert Bringhurst commented that "it was a widespread custom for many years to attribute almost any good sixteenth-century French font" to Garamond.<ref name="Sources Of Roman And Italic Types Used By English Printers In The Sixteenth Century"></ref><ref name="Galliard: A Revival of Types of Robert Granjon"></ref> As a result, while "Garamond" is a common term in the printing industry, the terms "French Renaissance antiqua" and "Garalde" have been used in academic writing to refer generally to fonts on the Aldus-French Renaissance model by Garamond and others.<ref name="BainesHaslam2005"></ref><ref name="Mosley New Approaches to the Classification of Typefaces"></ref> 
In particular, many 'Garamond' revivals of the early twentieth century are actually based on the work of a later punchcutter, Jean Jannon, whose noticeably different work was for some years misattributed to Garamond. The most common digital font named Garamond is Monotype Garamond. Developed in the early 1920s and bundled with many Microsoft products, it is a revival of Jannon's work.
