Jay Silverheels

===Television===
Jay Silverheels achieved his greatest fame as Tonto on The Lone Ranger (1949-1957). The fictional story line maintains that a small group of Texas Rangers were massacred, with only a "lone" survivor. The Lone Ranger and Tonto then ride throughout the West to assist those challenged by the lawless element. Their expenses and bullets are provided through a silver mine owned by The Lone Ranger, who also names his horse "Silver". Being irreplaceable in his role, Silverheels appeared in the film sequels: The Lone Ranger (1956) and The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold (1958).<ref></ref>
When The Lone Ranger television series ended, Silverheels continued to be typecast as a Native American. On January 6, 1960, he portrayed a Native American fireman trying to extinguish a forest fire in the episode "Leap of Life" in the syndicated series, Rescue 8, starring Jim Davis and Lang Jeffries.
Silverheels appeared in an episode of the TV series, Love, American Style, in which two tribe members try to talk a young white man, who wishes to marry a girl from their tribe, into enduring the tribe’s “test of manhood” a barbaric ritual of surviving in the wilderness. No matter how she pleads and begs, using all her womanly wiles, he refuses, thus passing the tribe’s true “test of manhood.” Love and the Bachelor Party/Love and the Latin Lover/Love and the Old-Fashioned Father/Love and the Test of Manhood (Release Date: 11 February 1972).
Eventually, he went to work as a salesman to supplement his acting income.<ref></ref> He also began to publish poetry inspired by his youth on the Six Nations Indian Reserve and recited his work on television. In 1966, he guest-starred as John Tallgrass in the short-lived ABC comedy/western series The Rounders, with Ron Hayes, Patrick Wayne, and Chill Wills.
Despite the typecasting, Silverheels in later years often poked fun at his character. In 1969, he appeared as Tonto without The Lone Ranger in a comedy sketch on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.<ref></ref> The sketch was featured on the 1974 record album Here's Johnny: Magic Moments from the Tonight Show. "My name is Tonto. I hail from Toronto and I speak Esperanto." In 1970, he appeared in a commercial for Chevrolet as a Native American chief who rescues two lost hunters, who had ignored his advice, in that year's Chevy Blazer. The William Tell Overture is heard in the background.
Silverheels spoofed his Tonto character in a Stan Freberg Jeno's Pizza Rolls TV commercial opposite Clayton Moore, and in The Phynx, opposite John Hart, both having played The Lone Ranger in the original television series.
He appeared in three 1964/5 episodes of NBC's Daniel Boone, starring Fess Parker in the title role.
His later appearances included an episode of ABC's The Brady Bunch, as a Native American who befriends the Bradys in the Grand Canyon, and in an episode of the short-lived Dusty's Trail, starring Bob Denver of Gilligan's Island.
In the early 1960s, Silverheels supported the Indian Actors Workshop,<ref></ref> where Native American actors refined their skills<ref></ref> in Echo Park, Los Angeles.<ref></ref> Today the workshop is firmly established.<ref></ref>
==Personal life==
Silverheels raised, bred and raced Standardbred horses in his spare time. Once, when asked about possibly running Tonto's paint horse Scout in a race, Silverheels laughed off the idea: "Heck, I can outrun Scout!"<ref></ref>
Married in 1945, Silverheels was the father of first son, Steve, four daughters named Marilyn, Gail, Pamela, and Karen, and a second son, Jay Anthony Silverheels Junior, who also was briefly an actor.<ref></ref>
==Death==
Silverheels suffered a stroke in 1976,<ref name="Cheryl Petten"/> and the following year, Clayton Moorehis co-star on The Lone Rangerrode a paint horse in Silverheels' honor in the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parade.<ref></ref> Silverheels died on March 5, 1980, from complications of a stroke,<ref name=aldwjsh/> at age sixty-seven, in Calabasas, Los Angeles County, California.<ref></ref> He was cremated at Chapel of the Pines Crematory, and his ashes were returned to the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario.<ref name="Cheryl Petten"/>
==Legacy==
In 1993, Silverheels was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He was named to the Western New York Entertainment Hall of Fame, and his portrait hangs in Buffalo, New York's Shea's Buffalo Theatre. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6538 Hollywood Boulevard. First Americans in the Arts honored Silverheels with their Life Achievement Award.
In 1997, Silverheels was inducted, under the name Harry "Tonto" Smith, into the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame in the Veteran Player category in recognition of his lacrosse career during the 1930s.
A fictionalized version of Silverheels appears in the Thrilling Adventure Hour serialized segment "Tales from the Black Lagoon".
