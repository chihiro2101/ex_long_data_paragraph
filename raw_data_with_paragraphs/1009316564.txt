== Current versions ==
A common modern version is:<ref name="Donna Wood"></ref>
:Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,
:Catch a tiger by the toe.
:If he hollers, let him go, 
:Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
The scholars Iona and Peter Opie noted that many variants have been recorded, some with additional words such as ". O. U. T. spells out, And out goes she, In the middle of the deep blue sea"<ref name=opie1997 /> or "My mother told me/says to pick the very best one, and that is Y-O-U/you are not it";<ref name=opie1997 /> while another source cites "Out goes Y-O-U."<ref name=bauer2002>L. and W. Bauer, </ref>
== Origins ==
The first record of a similar rhyme, called the "Hana, man," is from about 1815, when children in New York City are said to have repeated the rhyme:
:Hana, man, mona, mike;
:Barcelona, bona, strike;
:Hare, ware, frown, vanac;
:Harrico, warico, we wo, wac.<ref name=opie1997 />
Henry Carrington Bolton discovered this version to be in the US, Ireland and Scotland in the 1880s but was unknown in England until later in the century.<ref name=opie1997 /> Bolton also found a similar rhyme in German:
:Ene, tene, mone, mei,
:Pastor, lone, bone, strei,
:Ene, fune, herke, berke,
:Wer? Wie? Wo? Was?<ref name=opie1997 />
Variations of this rhyme, with the nonsense/counting first line have been collected since the 1820s, such as this one, which includes the 'toe' and 'olla' from Kipling's version:
:Eenie, Meenie, Tipsy, toe;
:Olla bolla Domino,
:Okka, Pokka dominocha,
:Hy! Pon! Tush!
This was one of many variants of "counting out rhymes" collected by Bolton in 1888.<ref>H. Bolton, H., The Counting-Out Rhymes of Children: Their Antiquity, Origin and Wide Distribution (1888)</ref>
A Cornish version collected in 1882 runs:
:Ena, mena, mona, mite,
:Bascalora, bora, bite,
:Hugga, bucca, bau,
:Eggs, butter, cheese, bread.
:Stick, stock, stone dead – OUT.<ref>Fred Jago The Glossary of the Cornish Dialect (1882)</ref>
One theory about the origins of the rhyme is that it is descended from Old English or Welsh counting, similar to the old Shepherd's count "Yan Tan Tethera" or the Cornish "Eena, mena, mona, mite".<ref name="opie1997" />
Another possibility is that British colonials returning from India introduced a doggerel version of an Indian children's rhyme used in the game of carom billiards:
:baji neki baji thou,
:elim tilim latim gou.<ref name="Mishra">Nihar Ranjan Mishra, From Kamakhya, a socio-cultural study (New Delhi: D.K. Printworld, 2004), p. 157.</ref>
Another possible origin is from a Swahili poem brought to the Americas by enslaved Africans: Iino ya mmiini maiini mo.<ref>Bennett, P.R. (1974). Remarks on a little-known Africanism. Ba Shiru, 6(1), 69-71.</ref>
A possible origin is a centuries-old, possibly Old Saxon, divination rhyme. This was shown in 1957 by the Dutch philologists Jan Naarding and Klaas Heeroma of the (Low Saxon Institute) at the University of Groningen.<ref>J. Naarding en K.H. Heeroma, Een oud wichellied en zijn verwanten, in: Driemaandelijkse Bladen, 1957, p. 37-43. Online at the urltoken Twentse Taalbank.</ref> The rhyme was recorded in 1904 by Nynke van Hichtum in Goor in the eastern Netherlands.
:Anne manne miene mukke,
:Ikke tikke takke tukke,
:Eere vrouwe grieze knech,
:Ikke wikke wakke weg.
== American and British versions ==
Some versions of this rhyme use the racial slur "nigger" instead of "tiger". Iona and Peter Opie quote the following version:
:Eena, meena, mina, mo,
:Catch a nigger by his toe;
:If he squeals let him go,
:Eena, meena, mina, mo.<ref name=opie1997>I. Opie and P. Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 156-8.</ref>
This version was similar to that reported by Henry Carrington Bolton as the most common version among American schoolchildren in 1888.<ref>H. Bolton, H., The Counting-Out Rhymes of Children: Their Antiquity, Origin and Wide Distribution (1888, Kessinger Publishing, 2006), pp. 46 and 105.</ref> It was used in the chorus of Bert Fitzgibbon's 1906 song "Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Mo":
:Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Mo,
:Catch a nigger by the toe,
:If he won't work then let him go;
:Skidum, skidee, skidoo.
:But when you get money, your little bride
:Will surely find out where you hide,
:So there's the door and when I count four,
:Then out goes you.<ref>B. Fitzgibbon, Words and music, "Eeny, meeny, miny, mo"
F. B. Haviland Publishing Co (1906).</ref>
It was also used by Rudyard Kipling in his "A Counting-Out Song", from Land and Sea Tales for Scouts and Guides, published in 1935.<ref>R. Kipling, R. T. Jones, G. Orwell, eds The Works of Rudyard Kipling (Wordsworth Editions, 1994), p. 771.</ref> This may have helped popularise this version in the United Kingdom where it seems to have replaced all earlier versions until the late twentieth century.<ref name=opie1997 />
Iona and Peter Opie pointed out in The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (1951) that the word "nigger" was common in American folklore, but unknown in any English traditional rhyme or proverb.<ref name=opie1997 /> This, combined with evidence of various other versions of the rhyme in the British Isles pre-dating this post-slavery version, would seem to suggest that it originated in North America, although the apparently American word "holler" was first recorded in written form in England in the 14th century, whereas according to the Oxford English Dictionary the words "Niger" or "'nigger" were first recorded in England in the 16th century with their current disparaging meaning. The 'olla' and 'toe' are found as nonsense words in some 19th century versions of the rhyme.
== Variations ==
There are considerable variations in the lyrics of the rhyme, including from early twentieth century in the United States of America:
:Eeny, meeny, miny moe,
:Catch a tiger by the toe.
:If he hollers make him pay,
:Fifty dollars every day.<ref name=opie1997 />
During the Second World War, an AP dispatch from Atlanta, Georgia reported: "Atlanta children were heard reciting this wartime rhyme: 
:Eenie, meenie, minie, moe,
:Catch the emperor by his toe.
:If he hollers make him say:
:'I surrender to the USA.'"<ref></ref>
A distinct version of the rhyme in the United Kingdom, collected in the 1950s & 1960s, is:
:Eeeny, meeny, miney, mo.
:Put the baby on the po.
:When he's done,
:Wipe his bum.
:And tell his mother what he's done.<ref>I. Opie and P. Opie, Children's Games in Street and Playground (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1969), p. 36.</ref> (Alternatively: Shove the paper up the lum)<ref></ref>
The most common version in New Zealand is:
:Eeny, meeny, miny moe,
:Catch a tiger by the toe.
:If he squeals, let him go,
:Eeny, meeny, miny moe.
:Pig snout you're out.<ref name=bauer2002 />
== Controversies ==
* In 1993, a high school teacher in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, provoked a student walkout when she said, in reference to poor test performance, "What did you do? Just go eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch a nigger by the toe?" The school's district superintendent recommended the teacher "lose three days of pay, undergo racial sensitivity training, and have a memorandum detailing the incident placed in her personnel file".<ref></ref>
* A jocular use of a form of the rhyme by a Southwest Airlines flight attendant, encouraging passengers to sit down so the plane could take off, led to a 2003 lawsuit charging the airline with intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Two versions of the rhyme were attested in court; both "Eeny meeny miny mo, Please sit down it's time to go" and "Pick a seat, it's time to go". The passengers in question were African American and stated that they were humiliated due to what they called the "racist history" of the rhyme. A jury returned a verdict in favor of Southwest and the plaintiffs' appeal was denied.<ref></ref>
* In May 2014, an unbroadcast outtake of BBC motoring show Top Gear showed presenter Jeremy Clarkson reciting the rhyme and deliberately mumbling a line which some took to be "catch a nigger by his toe".<ref></ref> In response to accusations of racism, Clarkson apologised to viewers that his attempts to obscure the line "weren't quite good enough".<ref></ref>
* In 2017, the retailer Primark pulled a T-shirt from its stores that featured the first line of the rhyme as spoken by The Walking Dead character Negan, overlaid with an image of his baseball bat. A customer, minister Ian Lucraft, complained the T-shirt was "fantastically offensive" and claimed the imagery "relates directly to the practice of assaulting black people in America."<ref></ref>

"Eeny, meeny, miny, moe"—which can be spelled a number of ways—is a children's counting rhyme, used to select a person in games such as tag, or for selecting various other things. It is one of a large group of similar rhymes in which the child who is pointed to by the chanter on the last syllable is either "chosen" or "counted out". The rhyme has existed in various forms since well before 1820<ref>I. & P. Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery rhymes (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1951, 1952), p. 12.</ref> and is common in many languages with similar-sounding nonsense syllables.
Since many similar counting rhymes existed earlier, it is difficult to know its exact origin.
