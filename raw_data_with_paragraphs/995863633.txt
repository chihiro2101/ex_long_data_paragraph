American Psychiatric Association

==History==
At a meeting in 1844 in Philadelphia, thirteen superintendents and organizers of insane asylums and hospitals formed the Association of Medical Superintendents of American Institutions for the Insane (AMSAII). The group included Thomas Kirkbride, creator of the asylum model which was used throughout the United States. The group was chartered to focus "primarily on the administration of hospitals and how that affected the care of patients", as opposed to conducting research or promoting the profession.<ref></ref>
In 1893, the organization changed its name to The American Medico-Psychological Association.<ref> urltoken Barton, p. 89</ref> In 1921, the Association changed that name to the present American Psychiatric Association.<ref name=Barton168> urltoken Barton, p. 168</ref> The Association was incorporated in 1927.<ref name=Barton168/>
The cover of the publication Semi-Centennial Proceedings of the American Medical Psychological Association, which the Association distributed in 1894 at its 50th annual meeting in Philadelphia, contained the first depiction of the Association's official seal.<ref name=Ozarin> </ref> The seal has undergone several changes since that time.<ref name=Ozarin/> 
The present seal is a round medallion with a purported likeness of Benjamin Rush's profile and 13 stars over his head to represent the 13 founders of the organization. The outer ring contains the words "American Psychiatric Association 1844." Rush's name and an M.D. are below the picture.<ref name=Ozarin/><ref> 
</ref> 
An Association history of the seal states:<blockquote>The choice of Rush (1746–1813) for the seal reflects his place in history. . Rush's practice of psychiatry was based on bleeding, purging, and the use of the tranquilizer chair and gyrator. By 1844 these practices were considered erroneous and abandoned. Rush, however, was the first American to study mental disorder in a systematic manner, and he is considered the father of American Psychiatry.<ref name=Ozarin/></blockquote>
In 2015, the Association adopted a new logo that depicts the serpent-entwined Rod of Asclepius superimposed over the image of two Cerebral hemisphere. The logo appears next to the words "American Psychiatric Association", with the word "Psychiatric" in bold type; the tagline "Medical leadership for mind, brain and body" appears below the logo. The Association will continue to use the seal bearing Rush's profile for ceremonial purposes and for some internal documents.<ref></ref>

==Publications and campaigns==
APA position statements,<ref> urltoken APA Policy Finder </ref> clinical practice guidelines,<ref name= connect-with></ref> and descriptions of its core diagnostic manual (the DSM) are published.
APA publishes several journals<ref name= connect-with /> focused on different areas of psychiatry, for example, academic, clinical practice, or news.
===Top five Choosing Wisely recommendations===
In coordination with the American Board of Internal Medicine, the APA proposes five recommendations for physicians and patients. The list was compiled by members of the Council on Research and Quality Care.<ref name=recommendations></ref> The APA places a primary focus on antipsychotic medications due to a rapid increase in sales, from $9.6 billion in 2004 to $18.5 billion in 2011.<ref></ref>
# Don't prescribe antipsychotic medications to patients for any indication without appropriate initial evaluation and appropriate ongoing monitoring.
# Don't routinely prescribe 2 or more antipsychotic medications concurrently.
# Don't prescribe antipsychotic medications as a first-line intervention to treat behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.
# Don't routinely prescribe antipsychotic medications as a first-line intervention for insomnia in adults.
# Don't routinely prescribe antipsychotic medications as a first-line intervention for children or adolescents for any diagnosis other than psychotic disorders.<ref name=recommendations />

==Drug company ties==
In his book Anatomy of an Epidemic (2010), Robert Whitaker described the partnership that has developed between the APA and pharmaceutical companies since the 1980s.<ref name=Anatomy></ref> APA has come to depend on pharmaceutical money.<ref name=Anatomy /> The drug companies endowed continuing education and psychiatric "grand rounds" at hospitals. They funded a Political Action Committee (PAC) in 1982 to lobby Congress.<ref name=Anatomy /> The industry helped to pay for the APA's media training workshops.<ref name=Anatomy /> It was able to turn psychiatrists at top schools into speakers, and although the doctors felt they were independents, they rehearsed their speeches and likely would not be invited back if they discussed drug side effects.<ref name=Anatomy /> "Thought leaders" became the experts quoted in the media.<ref name=Anatomy /> As Marcia Angell wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine (2000), "thought leaders" could agree to be listed as an author of ghostwriter articles,<ref></ref> and she cites Thomas Bodenheimer and David Rothman who describe the extent of the drug industry's involvement with doctors.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The New York Times published a summary about antipsychotic medications in October 2010.<ref></ref>
In 2008, for the first time, Senator Charles Grassley asked the APA to disclose how much of its annual budget came from drug industry funds. The APA said that industry contributed 28% of its budget ($14 million at that time), mainly through paid advertising in APA journals and funds for continuing medical education.<ref name=stuarta></ref>
==Controversies==
In the 1964 election, Fact magazine polled American Psychiatric Association members on whether Barry Goldwater was fit to be president and published "The Unconscious of a Conservative: A Special Issue on the Mind of Barry Goldwater". This led to a ban on the diagnosis of a public figure by psychiatrists who have not performed an examination or been authorized to release information by the patient. This became the Goldwater rule.<ref name=tele></ref><ref></ref>
Supported by various funding sources, the APA and its members have played major roles in examining points of contention in the field and addressing uncertainties about psychiatric illness and its treatment, as well as the relationship of individual mental health concerns to those of the community. Controversies have related to anti-psychiatry and disability rights campaigners, who regularly protest at American Psychiatric Association offices or meetings. In 1971, members of the Gay Liberation Front organization sabotaged an APA conference in San Francisco. In 2003 activists from MindFreedom International staged a 21-day hunger strike, protesting at a perceived unjustified biomedical focus and challenging APA to provide evidence of the widespread claim that mental disorders are due to chemical imbalances in the brain. APA published a position statement in response<ref>
</ref> and the two organizations exchanged views on the evidence.
The APA's DSM came under criticism from autism specialists Tony Attwood and Simon Baron-Cohen for proposing the elimination of Asperger's syndrome as a disorder and replacing it with an autism spectrum severity scale. Roy Richard Grinker wrote a controversial editorial for The New York Times expressing support for the proposal.
The APA president in 2005, Steven Sharfstein, praised the pharmaceutical industry but argued that American psychiatry had "allowed the biopsychosocial model to become the bio-bio-bio model" and accepted "kickbacks and bribes" from pharmaceutical companies leading to the over-use of medication and neglect of other approaches.<ref></ref> 
In 2008 APA was the focus of congressional investigations on how pharmaceutical industry money shapes the practices of nonprofit organizations that purport to be independent. The drug industry accounted in 2006 for about 30 percent of the association's $62.5 million in financing, half through drug advertisements in its journals and meeting exhibits, and the other half sponsoring fellowships, conferences and industry symposiums at its annual meeting. The APA came under increasing scrutiny and questions about conflicts of interest.<ref></ref> 
The APA president in 2009–10, Alan Schatzberg, was identified as the principal investigator on a federal study into the drug Mifepristone for use as an antidepressant being developed by Corcept Therapeutics, a company Schatzberg had created and in which he had several million dollars' equity.<ref></ref>
