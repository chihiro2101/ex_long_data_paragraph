=== Charlestown ===
Charlestown in south east Baildon is the area of Baildon with the highest concentration of industry.
The area is in the valley bottom between Otley Road and the River Aire, and includes the Acorn Park Industrial Estate and the Butterfield Industrial Estate. Notable companies established in Charlestown include Manor Coating Systems<ref name="TL:MCS"></ref> and Denso Marston Radiators.<ref name=TM></ref>
Further north east in Charlestown there are plans for a 'Baildon Business Park' and hotel on a green field site near Buck Lane, at a cost of £25&nbsp;million but there is opposition to the move.<ref name="TA:BGIB">; </ref>
Another industrial area is the Tong Park Industrial Estate off Otley Road in eastern Baildon.
== Landmarks ==
One&nbsp;of&nbsp;the main monuments in Baildon is the Frances Ferrand memorial fountain, known locally as the 'potted meat stick'.
This was built by Baron Amphlett of Somerset as a memorial to his mother-in-law, Frances Ferrand.<ref></ref>
It still stands today to the eastern side of Browgate.
In 1925 the monument was put at threat when plans were produced to replace in with a bus terminus.
In the 1960s the monument was removed and dismantled; however, in 1986 the Mechanics Institute raised funds to take it out of storage and restore it.<ref name=PMS></ref>
To the north of Towngate roundabout in front of Glendale House is a concrete paved open area created in the 1960s containing what remains of the stocks and a sandstone pillar thought to be the remains of a mediaeval cross, both Grade II listed.<ref name="BMDC:BSRCA"></ref>
On Glen Road on the edge of Baildon Moor, close to Shipley Glen, is Bracken Hall Countryside Centre and Museum, a free-to-visit children's museum, natural history education centre and nature centre.<ref name="BMAG"></ref>
Baildon's War Memorials are situated on Browgate<ref name="BDP:BWM"></ref>
and in Tong Park.<ref name="WW2M:TPWM"></ref>

=== Churches ===
The Church of St.&nbsp;James in Charlestown is a painted tongue and groove timber building, now a grade&nbsp;II listed building.<ref name="BLB-CoSJ"></ref>
It was moved to Baildon from Great Warley, Essex in 1905.
The Reverend N.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Bailey, rector of Great Warley, had property in Baildon and hoped to retire there.
However his obituary was published in November 1900 before he retired.
In 2007/2008 the church was moved again, but only by a few yards.
This allowed the surrounding land to be sold by the Diocese for development.
Rotten timbers were replaced and underground heat pump system installed to make the building more eco-friendly.
The Church of St. John the Evangelist designed by Mallinson & Healey, was built in 1848 though the south tower was not added until 1928.
The east window designed by Powell & Sons was added in 1870.<ref name=SJEB>; </ref>
== Transport ==
The village is served by Baildon railway station on the electrified Wharfedale Line with connections to Bradford Forster Square and Ilkley.
There is however, no service to Leeds owing to its position on the curve between the two lines.
Passengers must instead change at Shipley or the nearby Guiseley (Shipley having more services).
Baildon is served by the West Yorkshire Metro 626, 649, and 656–659 First and Yorkshire Tiger bus services.<ref name=WYM></ref>
The main road through Baildon is the A6038 road while the B6151 Baildon Road / Brow Gate goes the short distance from Otley Road up to Browgate roundabout.
== Education ==
There were a large number of First and Middle schools in the area, including Fernihurst First School, Tong Park First School, Belmont Middle School & Ladderbanks Middle School, before the 1998 Bradford Education reform which returned the area to a two-tier school system.
Currently, there are four local primary schools: Sandal Primary School to the North on West Lane, Baildon Church of England School to the east off Langley Lane, Hoyle Court Primary school in Charlestown and Glenaire Primary School to the south on Thompson Lane.
The nearest secondary school for the area is Titus Salt School on Higher Coach Road, overlooking Roberts Park, Saltaire. There is dispute as to which town the school actually is in, some classing it as Baildon and some as Saltaire<ref name=TSS></ref>
== Sport ==
Within Baildon there are sports clubs for cricket, football, golf, rugby and running.<ref name=SPORT>; ; ; ; </ref>
== Culture and events ==
For nearly a quarter of a century the Bank holiday weekend saw over 500 Harley-Davidson riders arrive in Baildon as part of the annual UK rally of the Harley-Davidson Riders Club of Great Britain fundraising rally.
The HDRCGB ran the rally up to 2001 when it moved to Berkshire.
In 2003, Harley-Davidson's Centenary Year, the HDRCGB hosted the event for the last time in Baildon.
The rally is now organised by the Shipley Harley-Davidson Club.
In 2008 430 riders were given a police escort down Browgate towards Hollins Hill, from where most riders travelled to Harewood House.
