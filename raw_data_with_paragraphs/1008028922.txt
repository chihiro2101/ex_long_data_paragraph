United World Colleges

==History==
UWC was originally founded in 1962 to bridge social, national and cultural divides caused by the Cold War. The first UWC college, Atlantic College in Wales, United Kingdom, was founded in 1962 by Kurt Hahn, a German educationalist who had previously founded Schule Schloss Salem in Germany, Gordonstoun in Scotland, and the Outward Bound movement.
Hahn envisaged a college educating boys and girls aged 16 to 20. The selection would be based on personal motivation and potential, regardless of any social, economic or cultural factors. A scholarship programme would facilitate the recruitment of young people from different socio-economic backgrounds.<ref> S. 88</ref>
There are currently 18 UWC schools and colleges in operation.<ref></ref> UWC Simón Bolivar was a member of the movement until its closing in 2012 by the Venezuelan government. The location and opening date for each UWC school and college is given below:

== Academics ==
UWC values experiential learning alongside providing its 16-19-year-old students with the IB Diploma Programme, an internationally recognised pre-university educational programme developed in close collaboration with UWC in the late 1960s.<ref name=":1"></ref> The IB Diploma Programme was co-developed by UWC Atlantic College, the Geneva International School and the United Nations School in New York in 1968<ref></ref> and aims "to develop students who have excellent breadth and depth of knowledge – students who flourish physically, intellectually, emotionally and ethically".<ref></ref> Until today, UWC and the IB Organisation continue to work closely together to develop new curricula and shaping international education.
Five UWC schools (UWC Thailand, UWC South East Asia in Singapore, UWC Maastricht in the Netherlands, UWC East Africa in Tanzania and Waterford Kamhlaba in Swaziland) also offer non-residential educational programmes for younger students.

UWC (or United World Colleges) is a global network of schools and educational programmes with the shared mission of "making education a force to unite people, nations and cultures for peace and a sustainable future".<ref></ref> The organisation was founded on the principles of German educationalist Kurt Hahn in 1962 to promote intercultural understanding.<ref></ref> Today, UWC consists of 18 schools on four continents, some of which are also open to younger years (from Kindergarten). Young people are selected for the IB Diploma Programme from over 150 countries through a system of volunteer-run national committees, "no matter their personal or financial circumstances".<ref></ref>
