Polydactyly

==Signs and symptoms==
In humans/animals this condition can present itself on one or both hands. The extra digit is usually a small piece of soft tissue that can be removed. Occasionally it contains bone without joints; rarely it may be a complete functioning digit. The extra digit is most common on the ulnar (little finger) side of the hand, less common on the radial (thumb) side, and very rarely within the middle three digits. These are respectively known as postaxial (little finger), preaxial (thumb), and central (ring, middle, index fingers) polydactyly. The extra digit is most commonly an abnormal fork in an existing digit, or it may rarely originate at the wrist as a normal digit does.<ref></ref>
The incidence of congenital deformities in newborns is approximately 2%, and 10% of these deformities involve the upper extremity.<ref name="Flatt"></ref><ref name="McCarroll"></ref> Congenital anomalies of the limb can be classified in seven categories, proposed by Frantz and Oâ€™Rahilly and modified by Swanson, based on the embryonic failure causing the clinical presentation. These categories are failure of formation of parts, failure of differentiation, duplication, overgrowth, undergrowth, congenital constriction band syndrome, and generalized skeletal abnormalities.<ref name="Frantz"></ref><ref name="Swanson"></ref> Polydactyly belongs to the category of duplication.<ref name="Watt"></ref>
Because there is an association between polydactyly and several syndromes, children with a congenital upper extremity deformity should be examined by a geneticist for other congenital anomalies. This should also be done if a syndrome is suspected, or if more than two or three generations of the family are affected.<ref name="Nieuwenhovenned"></ref>
Research has shown that the majority of congenital anomalies occur during the 4-week embryologic period of rapid limb development.<ref name="Watt"/> Polydactyly has been associated with 39 genetic mutations.<ref name="Biesecker"></ref> More specific loci and genetic mechanisms responsible for disorders of duplications will be defined with time, as molecular research continues.<ref name="Watt"/>
Polydactyly can be divided into three major types, which are discussed below.
===Ulnar or postaxial polydactyly===
This is the most common situation, in which the extra digit is on the ulnar side of the hand, thus the side of the little finger. This can also be called postaxial polydactyly. It can manifest itself very subtly, for instance only as a nubbin on the ulnar side of the little finger, or very distinctly, as a fully developed finger. Most commonly, the extra finger is rudimentary, consisting of an end phalanx with a nail, and connected to the hand with a small skin pedicle. Mostly one neurovascular bundle can be identified, with no tendons present in the extra digit. In case of a fully developed extra finger, the duplication usually presents itself at the level of the metacarpophalangeal joint. A triplication of the little finger is very rare. Ulnar polydactyly occurs ten times more often in African populations.<ref name="Buck"></ref> The incidence in Caucasians is reported as 1 in 1,339 live births, compared with 1 in 143 live births in Africans and African Americans. Ulnar polydactyly is also often part of a syndrome.<ref name="Buck"/> In patients with African ancestry ulnar polydactyly mostly occurs isolated, whereas the presentation in Caucasians is often associated with a syndrome,<ref name="Watt"/> though in a retrospective review, only 4 of 37 cases of ulnar polydactyly in Caucasians were syndromic.<ref name="Reyen"></ref> In almost 14% of all patients, this type of polydactyly is hereditary. It usually passes on in an autosomal dominant manner with variable expression and incomplete penetrance. It is genetically heterogenic, meaning that mutations in different genes can be the cause. When the extra digit is pedicled it can be very movable; however, injuries are rare and have never been reported so far.
===Radial or preaxial polydactyly===
This is a less common situation, in which the affectation is on the side of the hand towards the thumb. Radial polydactyly refers to the presence of an extra digit (or extra digits) on the radial side of the hand. It is most frequent in Indian populations and it is the second most common congenital hand disorder. The incidence of radial polydactyly is reported as 1 in every 3,000 live births.<ref name="Jobe"></ref> The clinical features of radial polydactyly will depend upon the extent of duplication.<ref name="Buck"/>
Radial polydactyly varies from a barely visible radial skin tag to complete duplication. Thumb polydactyly varies from barely visible broadening of the distal phalanx to full duplication of the thumb including the first metacarpal.<ref name="wikibooks"></ref>
Radial polydactyly is frequently associated with several syndromes.<ref name="orthobullets"></ref>
===Central polydactyly===
This is a very rare situation, in which the extra digit is on the ring, middle or index finger. Of these fingers, the index finger is most often affected, whereas the ring finger is rarely affected.<ref name="erasmusmc"></ref>
This type of polydactyly can be associated with syndactyly, cleft hand and several syndromes.<ref name="Graham"></ref><ref name="Tada"></ref>
Polysyndactyly presents various degrees of syndactyly affecting fingers three and four.<ref name="wikibooks"/>
==Causes==
Polydactyly is associated with different mutations, either mutations in a gene itself or in a cis-regulatory element responsible for the expression of a specific gene. Mutations in Hoxa- or Hoxd clusters are reported leading to polydactyly. Interactions of Hoxd13 and GLI3 induce synpolydactyly, a combination of extra and consolidated digits. Other signal transduction pathways in this context are the Wnt signaling pathway or Notch.<ref name="Lange"></ref>
In the specific case of preaxial polydactyly (Hemingway mutant), a cis-acting mutation approximately 1Mb upstream of SHH gene has been implicated.<ref name="Lettice-2003"></ref> Normally SHH is expressed in an organiser region, called the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) on the posterior limb side. From there it diffuses anteriorly, laterally to the growth direction of the limb. In the mutant, smaller ectopic expression in a new organiser region is seen on the anterior side of the limb. This ectopic expression causes cell proliferation delivering the raw material for one or more new digits.<ref name="Lettice-2003"/><ref name="Lettice-2008"></ref><ref name="Lettice 2012"></ref>
In addition to the study of genetic causes of polydactyly limb patterning models are used to simulate the congenital disorder at the limb, being able to explain the development paths of polydactyly.
Polydactyly can occur by itself, or more commonly, as one feature of a syndrome of congenital anomalies. When it occurs by itself, it is associated with autosomal dominant mutations in single genes, i.e. it is not a multifactorial trait.<ref></ref> But mutation in a variety of genes can give rise to polydactyly. Typically the mutated gene is involved in developmental patterning, and a syndrome of congenital anomalies results, of which polydactyly is one feature or two.
Polydactyly has been linked to the prenatal environment, however, with a recent study showing a relationship to maternal pollution exposure in China.<ref></ref>

Polydactyly or polydactylism ,<ref></ref> also known as hyperdactyly, is an anomaly in humans and animals resulting in supernumerary fingers and/or toes.<ref name=Kaneshiro></ref> Polydactyly is the opposite of oligodactyly (fewer fingers or toes).
