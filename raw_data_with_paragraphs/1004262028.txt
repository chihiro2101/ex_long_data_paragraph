=== Early career ===

One of VanderMeer's early successes was his 2001 short-story collection City of Saints and Madmen, set in the imaginary city of Ambergris. Several of VanderMeer's novels were subsequently set in the same place, including Shriek: An Afterword (2006) and Finch (2009), the latter of which was a finalist for the Nebula Award for Best Novel.<ref></ref> In 2000, his novella The Transformation of Martin Lake won the World Fantasy Award.
VanderMeer has also worked in other media, including on a movie based on his novel Shriek that featured an original soundtrack by rock band The Church.

=== The Southern Reach Trilogy ===
In 2014, Farrar, Straus and Giroux published VanderMeer's Southern Reach Trilogy, consisting of the novels Annihilation, Authority, and Acceptance. The story focuses on a secret agency that manages expeditions into a location known as Area X. The area is an uninhabited and abandoned part of the United States that nature has begun to reclaim after a mysterious world-changing event.<ref name="IS inspired"></ref>
VanderMeer has said that the main inspiration for Area X and the series was his hike through St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge.<ref></ref> The Other Side of the Mountain by Michel Bernanos is among the books VanderMeer has cited as also having had an influence.<ref name="IS inspired" />
The trilogy was released in quick succession over an 8-month period, in what has been called an innovative "Netflix-inspired strategy."<ref name=LATimes>" urltoken The boundary-pushing fiction of Sean McDonald and his new FSG imprint, MCD," by Margaret Wappler, The Los Angeles Times, July 28, 2017.</ref> The strategy helped the second and third books reach the New York Times Bestseller list, and established VanderMeer as "one of the most forward-thinking authors of the decade."<ref name=LATimes/><ref></ref><ref></ref>
