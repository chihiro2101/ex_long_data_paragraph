James Herriot

==Career as an author==
Although Wight claimed in the preface of James Herriot's Yorkshire that he had begun to write only after his wife encouraged him at age 50, he in fact kept copious diaries as a child, as a teenager wrote for his school's magazine, and wrote at least one short story during his college years.<ref name="lord-bio"></ref> In the early 1960s he began analysing the books of successful authors that he enjoyed reading, such as P. G. Wodehouse and Conan Doyle, to understand different writing styles. During this time he also began writing more seriously, composing numerous short stories and, in his own words, 'bombarding' publishers with them.
Wight's early efforts at having his writing published were unsuccessful, which he later explained by telling Paul Vallely in a 1981 interview for the Sunday Telegraph Magazine that "my style was improving but . my subjects were wrong." Choosing a subject where he was more experienced, in 1969 he wrote If Only They Could Talk, a collection of stories centred around his experiences as a young veterinarian in the Yorkshire Dales. The book was published in the United Kingdom in 1970 by Michael Joseph Ltd. Wight followed it up with It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet in 1972. Sales were slow until Thomas McCormack of St. Martin's Press in New York City received a copy and arranged to have both books published as a single volume in the United States that same year. Wight named this volume All Creatures Great and Small from the second line of the hymn "All Things Bright and Beautiful". The resulting book was a huge success.
Wight wrote seven more books in the series started by If Only They Could Talk. In the United States, the first six books of the original series were thought too short to publish independently. Most of the stories were collected into three omnibus volumes; the final two books were published separately. The last book of the series, Every Living Thing, sold 650,000 copies in six weeks in the United States and stayed on The New York Times Best Seller list for eight months.
Contrary to widespread belief, Wight's books are only partially autobiographical, with many of the stories only loosely based on real events or people. Most of the stories are set in the fictional town of Darrowby, which Wight described as a composite of Thirsk, its nearby market towns Richmond, Leyburn, and Middleham, and 'a fair chunk of my own imagination'.<ref></ref> Wight anonymised the majority of his characters by renaming them: notably, he called Donald Sinclair and his brother Brian Siegfried and Tristan Farnon respectively, and used the name Helen Alderson for his wife Joan. At the time of the series's publication, veterinary surgeons were heavily discouraged from writing books under their own names (as doing so could be seen as advertisement), so Wight took 'James Herriot' as his pen name after seeing Scottish goalkeeper Jim Herriot play for Birmingham City F.C. in a televised game against Manchester United F.C. Many of the stories which are set in the 1930s–1950s were actually inspired by cases that Wight attended in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name="memoir" />
==Film and television adaptations==
Wight's books have been adapted for film and television, including the 1975 film All Creatures Great and Small followed by It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet in 1976.
The BBC produced a television series based on Wight's books titled All Creatures Great and Small, which ran from 1978 to 1980 and 1988–1990; ninety episodes were broadcast altogether.<ref></ref> 
In September 2010, the Gala Theatre in Durham presented the world premier professional stage adaptation of All Creatures Great & Small.<ref></ref>
In 2010, the BBC commissioned the three-part drama Young James Herriot inspired by Wight's early life and studies in Scotland. The series drew on archives and the diaries and case notes which Wight kept during his student days in Glasgow, as well as the biography written by his son.<ref> urltoken "BBC One and drama announce two exciting new commissions for Scotland", BBC Press Office, 26 July 2010. Retrieved 7 January 2012</ref> The first episode was shown on BBC One on 18 December 2011, and drew six million viewers. The BBC announced in April 2012 that the series would not return.<ref></ref> A book titled Young James Herriot was written to accompany the series by historian and author John Lewis-Stempel.<ref></ref>
A new production of All Creatures Great and Small was produced by Playground Entertainment for Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, and PBS in the United States.<ref></ref> The production received some funding from Screen Yorkshire.<ref></ref> Most of the filming was completed in the Yorkshire Dales, including many exteriors in Grassington as the setting for the fictional town of Darrowby.<ref></ref> 
The first series, of six episodes and a special Christmas episode premiered in the UK on Channel 5 on 1 September 2020 and in the US on PBS as part of Masterpiece on 10 January 2021. All Creatures Great and Small was renewed for a second series, also of six episodes plus a Christmas special.<ref></ref>
==Recognition and tourist industry==
Thirsk has become a magnet for fans of Wight's books.<ref></ref> Following his death, the practice at 23 Kirkgate was restored and converted into a museum, The World of James Herriot, which focuses on his life and writings. A local pub renamed itself the "Darrowby Inn," after the village name that Wight created to represent the locale in which he practiced.
Portions of the surgery sets used in the All Creatures Great and Small BBC series are on display at the museum, including the living room and dispensary. Some of the original contents of the surgery can be found at the Yorkshire Museum of Farming in Murton, York.<ref></ref> 
Grand Central train company operates train services from Sunderland to London King's Cross, stopping at Thirsk. British Rail Class 180 was named 'James Herriot' in Wight's honour, and was dedicated on 29 July 2009 by his daughter Rosemary and son James.<ref></ref> Actor Christopher Timothy, who played Herriot in the BBC television series, unveiled a statue of Wight in October 2014 at Thirsk Racecourse.<ref> urltoken "Actor Christopher Timothy unveils statue to James Herriot vet Alf Wight" – The Northern Echo, 5 October 2014</ref>
Wight received an honorary doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1979, and was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1979 New Year Honours.<ref name="heriot-watt"></ref><ref></ref> In 1994, the library at Glasgow Veterinary College was named the 'James Herriot Library' in honour of Wight's achievements. Wight was deeply gratified by this recognition, replying in his acceptance letter, 'I regard this as the greatest honour that has ever been bestowed upon me.' He was a lifelong supporter of Sunderland A.F.C., and was made an honorary president of the club in 1991.
A blue plaque was placed at Wight's childhood home in Glasgow in October 2018.<ref></ref> There is also a blue plaque at 23 Kirkgate, Wight's former surgery.<ref name="ttc"></ref>
Minor planet 4124 Herriot is named in his honour.<ref></ref>
