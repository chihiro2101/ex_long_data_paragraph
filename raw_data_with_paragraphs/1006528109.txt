At the age of 12, Johns and school friends Ben Gillies and Chris Joannou formed a band, originally named "The Innocent Criminals", and practised daily after school for periods of four hours or more.<ref name="Long"></ref><ref></ref>
The band's career began when the three members were 15 years old when a demo recording of their song "Tomorrow" won a competition that was run by the SBS TV programme Nomad.<ref name="Long" /> The group, now named Silverchair, subsequently accepted a three-album deal from Sony Music in 1994, and the label hurriedly released their first album Frogstomp in 1995 after "Tomorrow" remained in the No. 1 position on the Australian singles chart for six weeks.<ref name="Jann"></ref>
The band released Freak Show in 1997,<ref></ref> followed by Neon Ballroom in 1999,<ref></ref> and then Diorama in 2002.<ref></ref> Following Diorama, Silverchair embarked on a lengthy hiatus before the release of the next album.<ref name="Jann" />

<blockquote>When Qantas first approached me, I agreed to the project as I was really into the idea of creating a piece of music that represented Australia. I wanted it to sound big, something special. It was a conscious effort to create a good piece of music and not just a jingle. I've also wanted to work with the Australian Chamber Orchestra for a long time now, so it was great to finally be able to do that.<ref name="Kwek" /></blockquote>
