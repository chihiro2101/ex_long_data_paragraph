St Ives, Cornwall

==History==
===Early history===
The origin of St Ives is attributed in legend to the arrival of the Irish saint Ia of Cornwall, in the 5th century. The parish church bears her name, and the name St Ives derives from it.<ref name=tde></ref><ref></ref>
The Sloop Inn, which lies on the wharf was a fisherman's pub for many centuries and is dated to "circa 1312", making it one of the oldest inns in Cornwall.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The town was the site of a particularly notable atrocity during the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549. The English provost marshal, Anthony Kingston, came to St Ives and invited the portreeve, John Payne, to lunch at an inn. He asked the portreeve to have the gallows erected during the course of the lunch. Afterwards the portreeve and the Provost Marshal walked down to the gallows; the Provost Marshal then ordered the portreeve to mount the gallows. The portreeve was then hanged for being a "busy rebel".<ref></ref><ref></ref>
The seal of St Ives is Argent, an ivy branch overspreading the whole field Vert, with the legend Sigillum Burgi St. Ives in Com. Cornub. 1690.<ref></ref>
During the 3rd Spanish Armada, two Spanish ships, a bark and a pinnace, had made their way to St Ives to seek shelter from the storm which had dispersed the Spanish fleet. They were captured by the English warship Warspite of Sir Walter Raleigh leaking from the same storm.<ref></ref> The information given by the prisoners was vital on learning the Armada's objectives.<ref></ref>
===Fishing===
From medieval times fishing was important at St Ives; it was one of the most important fishing ports on the north Cornish coast. The original pier's construction date is unknown but the first reference to St Ives having a pier was in 1478 in William Worcester 'Itinerary'.<ref name="BSI59"></ref> The pier was re-built by John Smeaton between 1766 and 1770 after falling into disrepair.<ref name="BSI59" /> It was lengthened at a later date.<ref name="Into"></ref> The octagonal lookout with a cupola belongs to Smeaton's design.<ref>Pevsner, N.(1970) Cornwall; 2nd ed. Penguin; p. 181</ref>
A. K. Hamilton Jenkin describes how the St Ives fisherman strictly observed Sunday as a day of rest.<ref>A. K. Hamilton Jenkin (1932) Cornish Seafarers; chapter on fishing</ref> St Ives was a very busy fishing port and seining was the usual method of fishing. Seining was carried out by a set of three boats of different sizes, the largest two carrying seine nets of different sizes. The total number of crew was seventeen or eighteen. However this came to an end in 1924. In the decade 1747–1756 the total number of pilchards dispatched from the four principal Cornish ports of Falmouth, Fowey, Penzance, and St Ives averaged 30,000 hogsheads annually (making a total of 900 million fish). Much greater catches were achieved in 1790 and 1796. In 1847 the exports of pilchards from Cornwall amounted to 40,883 hogsheads or 122 million fish while the greatest number ever taken in one seine was 5,600 hogsheads at St Ives in 1868.<ref>Victoria History of Cornwall, vol. I, p. 584</ref> The bulk of the catch was exported to Italy: for example, in 1830, 6400 hogsheads were sent to Mediterranean ports. From 1829 to 1838, the yearly average for this trade was 9,000 hogsheads.<ref>Jenkin (1932) Cornish Seafarers; chapter on fishing</ref>
While commercial fishing is much reduced, the harbour is still in use, often for recreational boating, tourist fishing and day trips to the nearby seal colonies on the Carrack Rocks and other locations along the coast. Recently, a class of Victorian fishing boat unique to St Ives, known as a "jumbo," has been replicated by boatbuilder Jonny Nance to celebrate the town's maritime heritage. Today's jumbos are operated by the St Ives Jumbo Association.<ref></ref>
====Lifeboat====
The first lifeboat was stationed in the town in 1840.<ref name="RNLI" /> In 1867 the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) built a boathouse at Porthgwidden beach. It proved to be a difficult site to launch from, and in 1867 it was replaced by a building in Fore Street. In 1911 a new boathouse was built on the Quay, and then in 1993 a larger station was built at the landward end of the West Pier.<ref></ref> Since its inception in 1839, thirty eight RNLI medals have been awarded to rescuers from St Ives, 18 silver medals and 20 bronze.<ref name="RNLI" />
Seven crewmen died in the St Ives lifeboat tragedy of 1939.<ref name="RNLI"></ref> In the early hours of 23 January 1939 there was a Force 10 storm blowing with gusts up to . The lifeboat John and Sara Eliza Stych was launched at 3 o'clock to search for a ship reported in trouble off Cape Cornwall. It rounded the Island where it met the full force of the storm as it headed westwards. It capsized three times and drifted across St Ives Bay when its propeller was fouled. The first time it turned over four men were lost; the second time one more; the third time left only one man alive.<ref name="RNLI" /> He scrambled ashore when the boat was wrecked on rocks near Godrevy Point.<ref name=Bray></ref>
===Later history===
The modern seaside resort developed as a result of the arrival of the St Ives Bay Line from St Erth, part of the Great Western Railway in 1877.<ref></ref><ref></ref> With it came a new generation of Victorian seaside holidaymakers. Much of the town was built during the latter part of the 19th century. The railway, which winds along the cliffs and bays, survived the Beeching cuts and has become a tourist attraction itself.<ref></ref>
In 1952, the Royal Navy warship<ref></ref> HMS Wave ran aground near the town.<ref></ref> The ship was later salvaged, repaired and returned to service.<ref></ref> A propeller believed to be from HMS Wave was washed ashore in 2008.<ref></ref>
In 1999, the town was the first landfall of the solar eclipse of 11 August 1999. The Tate St Ives displayed an exhibition called As Dark as Light, with art by Yuko Shiraishi, Garry Fabian Miller and local schoolchildren, to celebrate the event.<ref></ref> A live BBC programme with the astronomer Patrick Moore was clouded out and the eclipse was missed.<ref></ref>
====Sharks====
On 28 July 2007 there was a suspected sighting of a great white shark. The chairman of the Shark Trust said that "it was impossible to make a conclusive identification and that it could have also been either a Mako or a Porbeagle shark". Coastguards dismissed the claims as "scaremongering".<ref></ref> On 14 June 2011 there was a suspected sighting of an oceanic whitetip shark; the Shark Trust said that the chances of the species being in British waters were "very small".<ref></ref> On 18 July 2017 a suspected blue shark was spotted close to the harbour.<ref></ref> On 16 July 2018, another blue shark was spotted in the harbour, prompting the Shark Trust to ask people to "give it plenty of space".<ref></ref><ref></ref>
==Geography==
St Ives is on the western shore of St Ives Bay, its harbour sheltered by St Ives Island (a headland) and Smeaton's pier. Close to the harbour, in the old part of the town, the streets are narrow and uneven while its wider streets are in the newer parts of the town on rising ground.<ref name=tde/> The town has four beaches: Porthmeor a surfing beach, Porthgwidden a small sandy cove, Harbour by the working port and Porthminster which has almost half a mile of sand.<ref></ref> St Ives has an oceanic climate and has some of the mildest winters and warmest summers in Britain and Northern Europe. It is therefore a popular tourist resort in the summer, and also benefits from an amount of sunshine per year that is above the national average.<ref></ref> The South West Coast Path passes through the town.<ref></ref>
==Politics and administration==
St Ives' local government administration has a two-tier structure, consisting of St Ives Town Council and Cornwall Council, both elected statutory bodies.<ref name="SIC"></ref><ref></ref>
The first tier of local government in St Ives is the Town Council, with a membership of 16 elected town councillors from three wards.<ref name="SIC" /><ref></ref> The council is responsible for providing grant funding to local organisations, public footpaths, bus shelters, beach patrols, traffic control and allotments. It is a statutory body which is consulted regarding planning decisions in the town's area and makes recommendations to the planning authority, Cornwall Council.
Before 1974, St Ives Borough Council was the principal local authority for what now forms the civil parish of St Ives. Since the Local Government Act 1972, St Ives has an elected town council.<ref name="SIC" /> The area overseen by the Town council of St Ives includes Lelant, Carbis Bay, Halsetown and St Ives. The elected town council members also become charter trustees of the original borough charter (for the duration of their term in office) which dates back to 1639 entitling them to carry out various ceremonial functions such as appointing a Mayor, awarding Freedom of the Borough to individuals, representing the Borough at formal occasions such as Remembrance Sunday wearing Robes and using the Coat of arms. Typically, the Mayor of the Town of St Ives is also the Mayor of the Borough of St Ives. However, most of the other principal local authority functions for St Ives were undertaken by Penwith District Council and the Cornwall County Council. From 1 April 2009 Penwith and the other five Cornish district councils were replaced by a unified council, Cornwall Council.
Like St Ives Town Council, Cornwall Council is a statutory body incorporated by Act of Parliament. Cornwall Council is the second tier of local government in the area and is a unitary authority with a far wider range of powers. The Council deals with roads, street lighting, highways, social services, children and family care, schools and public libraries.<ref></ref> St Ives itself elects three of the 123 councillors (for the St Ives East, St Ives West and St Just in Penwith wards).<ref></ref>
==Religion==
, the patron saint of fishermen.<ref></ref> In 1408 the townsmen attempted to get a papal bull to authorise the consecration of their church and cemetery, but they did not achieve this, so they continued without the rights of baptism or burial. However, they undertook the building of the present church between 1410 and 1434 as a chapel of ease, St Ives being within the parish of Lelant. They were able to obtain the right to a font in 1428 but consecration of the cemetery only in 1542. For over a century the vicars of Lelant had resisted demands from the inhabitants of St Ives and Towednack for the right of sepulture but in 1542 the right was granted so the vicars transferred their residence to St Ives and abandoned the vicarage of Lelant.<ref>Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; pp. 112, 141</ref> There was damage to the church in 1697 when a storm broke through the sea-wall and damaged the roof and a large window over the altar.<ref></ref>
There are chapels dedicated to St Nicholas on the headland of St Ives Island and St Leonard on the quay which were used by the fishermen and have been converted for other uses.<ref>Cornish Church Guide; p. 113</ref> The former chapel of St Nicholas was partially demolished by the War Office in 1904<ref>Mee, Arthur (1937) Cornwall. (The King's England.) London: Hodder & Stoughton; p. 223</ref> but rebuilt in 1909, possibly by E. H. Sedding, from the old materials. It is plain and rectangular and has since been converted into the New Gallery.
The Roman Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart and St Ia was built in 1909 to a design by A J C Scoles. There are also two Methodist chapels, one in Fore Street of 1831, and another of 1845 higher up the valley, and a Congregational chapel of 1800.<ref>Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall; 2nd ed. Penguin; p. 181</ref>
==Culture==
===Art===
Bernard Leach and Shōji Hamada set up the Leach Pottery in 1920. Leach who, was a studio potter and art teacher<ref>Cortazzi, Hugh. urltoken "Review of Emmanuel Cooper's Bernard Leach Life & Work. Japan Society (UK).</ref> and is known as the "Father of British studio pottery",<ref></ref> learned pottery under the direction of Shigekichi Urano (Kenzan VI) in Japan where he also met Shōji Hamada. They promoted pottery from the point of view of Western and Eastern arts and philosophies. Leach produced work until 1972, and the Victoria and Albert Museum held an exhibition of his work in 1977.<ref></ref> The Leach Pottery remains operational and houses a small museum showcasing work by Leach and his students.<ref>Leach Pottery website, urltoken last examined Aug 2011</ref>
In 1928, the Cornish artist Alfred Wallis and Ben Nicholson and Christopher Wood met at St Ives and laid the foundation for the St Ives School there. In 1939, Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth and Naum Gabo settled in St Ives, attracted by its beauty. In 1993, a branch of the Tate Gallery, the Tate St Ives, opened.<ref name="tate" /> The Tate has also owned the Barbara Hepworth Museum and her sculpture garden since 1980.<ref name="tate"></ref> The town attracted artists from overseas such as Piet Mondrian, and Maurice Sumray who moved from London in 1968,<ref></ref> and continues to do so today with younger artists such as Michael Polat, who took up residence there from his native Germany in 1999.
Before the 1940s, most artists in St Ives and West Cornwall belonged to the St Ives Society of Artists; but events in the late 1940s led to a dispute between the abstract and figurative artists in the group. In 1948 the abstract faction broke away to form the Penwith Society of Artists led by Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson.
In 1962 Frederick Spratt took a sabbatical in Britain for one year, where he lived and painted representationally in St Ives.
The studio pottery Troika was set up in 1963.
A 2010, a BBC Four film, The Art of Cornwall, presented by James Fox said that the St Ives artists "went on to produce some of the most exhilarating art of the twentieth century.for a few dazzling years this place was as famous as Paris, as exciting as New York and infinitely more progressive than London."<ref></ref> The programme explored the lives and works of the key figures and their contributions in establishing St Ives as a major centre of British art from the 1920s onwards.<ref></ref>
===Museums===
The Barbara Hepworth Museum and her sculpture garden are the responsibility of Tate St Ives.<ref></ref><ref name="bhm"></ref> It was the wish of the late sculptor to leave her work on public display in perpetuity.<ref name="bhm" /> The St Ives Museum has exhibits illustrating local history and culture, including mining, fishing, agriculture and domestic life.<ref></ref>
===Festivals===
John Knill, a former mayor, constructed the Knill Steeple, a granite monument overlooking the town. In 1797, Knill laid down instructions for the celebration of the Knill Ceremony, which was to take place every five years on 25 July (St James's Day). The ceremony involves the Mayor of St Ives, a customs officer, and a vicar accompanied by two widows and ten girls who should be the "daughters of fishermen, tinners, or seamen".
A second celebration, of perhaps greater antiquity, is St Ives Feast, a celebration of the founding of St Ives by St Ia, which takes place on the Sunday and Monday nearest to 3 February each year. It includes a civic procession to Venton Ia, the well of St Ia, and other associated activities. It is one of the two surviving examples of Cornish Hurling (in a gentler format than its other manifestation at St Columb Major).
A third festival is the St Ives May Day, a modern revival of West Cornwall May Day celebrations that were once common throughout west Cornwall.
The St Ives September Festival celebrated its 30th anniversary in September 2008. It is one of the longest running and widest ranging Festivals of the Arts in the UK lasting for fifteen days and includes music (folk, jazz, rock, classical & world), poetry, film, talks and books. It was founded in 1978 as a joint venture by local entrepreneurs and the International Musicians Seminar. Many local artists open up their studios to allow visitors to see how their art is produced. There is free music in many pubs almost every night, and concerts.<ref></ref> Many events are held at the Western Hotel or St Ives Guildhall.<ref></ref> St Ives has a 500-seat theatre which hosts some of the festival events.<ref></ref>

St Ives ,<ref></ref> meaning "St Ia’s cove") is a seaside town, civil parish and port in Cornwall, England. The town lies north of Penzance and west of Camborne on the coast of the Celtic Sea. In former times it was commercially dependent on fishing. The decline in fishing, however, caused a shift in commercial emphasis, and the town is now primarily a popular seaside resort, notably achieving the title of Best UK Seaside Town from the British Travel Awards in both 2010 and 2011.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> St Ives was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1639.<ref></ref><ref></ref> St Ives has become renowned for its number of artists. It was named best seaside town of 2007 by The Guardian newspaper.<ref></ref> It should not be confused with St Ive, a village and civil parish in south-east Cornwall.
