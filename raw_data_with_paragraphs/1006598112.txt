==Film career==
===Early career===
During film school, Dash was influenced by avant-garde, Latin American, African, and Russian cinema.<ref name="Johny"/> Dash's film work began to take on a new direction after film school. Dash said in a 1991 interview with the Village Voice, "I stopped making documentaries after discovering Toni Morrison, Toni Cade Bambara, and Alice Walker. I wondered, why can't we see movies like this? I realized I needed to learn how to make narrative movies."<ref name=":1"></ref> Being inspired by the novels of these black women authors led to her decision to direct dramatic films.<ref name=":1" />
Her 1975 short film Four Women is based on the ballad “Four Women” by Nina Simone. In the song, four women are portrayed (all by the dancer Linda Martina Young): Aunt Sarah, a slave, Saffronia, a mixed race woman, Sweet Thing, a prostitute, and Peaches, as a representation of black women overcoming racial and gender-specific forms of oppression.<ref></ref> Stereotypes of black women are directly addressed, asking the audience to address their own biases and stereotypes.
From 1978 to 1980, Dash worked as member of the Classifications and Ratings Administrations for the Motion Picture Association of America.<ref></ref> She had a special assignment screening at the Cannes International Film Festival to review a screening of short films in the Marché du Cinema.
=== Illusions (1982) ===
She wrote and directed the short film Illusions (34 minutes), which explores racial and sexual discrimination in Hollywood and American society.<ref> urltoken "CODES AND CLOSETS: JULIE DASH'S ILLUSIONS", UCLA Film and Television Archive, 14 November 2011</ref> Released in 1982, it was her first to earn more widespread success and attention.<ref name="voices.cla.umn.edu" /> Set in 1942 in the fictional National Studios, it follows a black woman executive, Mignon Duprée, who has "passed" for white to achieve her position. Also featured is Ester Jeeter, a black woman who dubs the singing voice in musicals for a white Hollywood star. They work in an industry based on creating images and alternative realities. The film explores Mignon's dilemma, Ester's struggle to get roles as an actress and singer rather than dub for others, and the uses of cinema in wartime: three illusions in conflict with reality.<ref> urltoken "Julie Dash: 'Illusions'", Women Make Movies</ref>
Illusions received the 1985 Black American Cinema Society Award and the Black Filmmaker Foundation's Jury Prize in 1989 as best film of the decade. Kevin Thomas of the LA Times described it as "a gripping critique of the power of the movies to shape perception," while exploring the illusions created by Hollywood, as well as the illusion of racial identity. The success of this film and other shorts enabled Dash to move to feature films. In 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."<ref name="Thomas">Thomas, Kevin.

===Daughters of the Dust (1991)===
Dash began work on a story in 1975 that was inspired by her father's Gullah family background and immigration from the Sea Islands of Georgia.<ref>Turan, Kenneth. (March 6, 1992) urltoken "'Daughters' Recaptures Power of Gullah Past," The Los Angeles Times. Retrieved on October 13, 2017.</ref> This would become the screenplay Daughters of the Dust, which went into production after she received $800,000 in financing from PBS in 1988. The film, set in 1902, revolves around three generations of Gullah women in the Peazant family on St. Helena Island off the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina. Innovative with its use of Gullah dialogue and interwoven story-lines among the predominately female cast, the film focuses on ancestral and matriarchal story lines as well as the history of former slaves who settled on the island and formed an independent community there. The screenplay was written in the dialect of the island settlers with no subtitles, resulting in an immersive language experience.<ref>Dash, Julie; Cade Bambara, Toni; hooks, bell. (1992).

Dash's experimental approach to narrative structure was something rarely seen in U.S. feature-filmmaking. Upon the film's re-release, she explained, “I.wanted to do a film that was so deeply embedded in the culture, was so authentic to the culture that it felt like a foreign film.”<ref name="APnews">Coyle, Jake.

Daughters of the Dust premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 1991, where it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize and won a cinematography award.<ref></ref> It became the first feature film by an African-American woman to be distributed in the United States in theatrical release<ref></ref> and gained critical praise for its use of dialect and music composed by John Barnes, as well for its cinematography and visual imagery.
The New York Times called Dash a "strikingly original film maker," noting that "for all its harsh allusions to slavery and hardship, the film is an extended, wildly lyrical meditation on the power of African cultural iconography and the spiritual resilience of the generations of women who have been its custodians."<ref name=NYTHolden>Holden, Stephen (January 16, 1992) urltoken "Review/Film; 'Daughters Of the Dust': The Demise Of a Tradition," The New York Times. Retrieved October 5, 2017.</ref>
Despite the critical acclaim, Dash wasn't able to get the financing to release another feature film, going on to work in television. Daughters of the Dust would continue to gain accolades for more than two decades. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 2004 as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."<ref name="cinema.ucla.edu" /> Its visuals would influence Beyoncé acclaimed 2016 video album Lemonade, featuring young women on the beach, dressed in white gowns as in the movie, and gathering in front of an island cabin.<ref></ref> On its 25th anniversary, the Cohen Media Group restored and distributed Daughters of the Dust for theatrical release, beginning at the 2016 Toronto Film Festival.<ref name=VanityFair>Desta, Yohanna.
