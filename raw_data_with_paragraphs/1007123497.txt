Tiến Quân Ca

==History==
Its lyrics and title were based on Văn Cao's previous works, "Thăng Long".<ref name=a /> Part of the lyrics were also different during its early stages,<ref name=tp/><ref name=hcm></ref> as it went through numerous changes starting in the early 1940s.
===Lyric changes and completion===
"Tiến Quân Ca" went through many changes shortly after it was composed. For instance, the first sentence "Đoàn quân Việt Nam đi" was originally "Đoàn quân Việt Minh đi."<ref name=tp/> The sixth part of the lyrics was also originally "Thề phanh thây uống máu quân thù",<ref name=hcm/><ref name=tk2></ref> expressing the brutality of French colonial and pre-famine actions. After many suggestions, Văn Cao changed it to "Đường vinh quang xây xác quân thù".<ref name=tp/> The last sentence "Tiến lên! Cùng tiến lên! Chí trai là nơi đây ước nguyền!" it was changed to "Núi sông Việt Nam ta vững bền", but when it was published it was changed to "Nước non Việt Nam ta vững bền!", which Văn Cao commented, "With a song that requires solemn, 'nước non' seemed too weak while being sung with 'núi sông' would be more reasonable."<ref name=tp></ref>
After completion of work, Văn Cao met and let Vũ Quý try the song. Vũ Quý was very happy at his work, and "Tiến Quân Ca" was published in papers on November 1944 with lithographs by Văn Cao.<ref name="f"></ref>
On August 17, 1945, the song was sung for the first time at a rally of civil servants in Hanoi by a Ph.D under the flag of the Việt Minh, and "robbed the loudspeakers". Văn Cao quoted, "That quiet man was an attraction to thousands of people listening that day".<ref name=sh>Bài Tiến Quân Ca, hồi ký Văn Cao trên tạp chí Sông Hương số 26, tháng 7 năm 1987</ref><ref name=tk></ref>
The poet and musician Nguyễn Đình Thi was touched after hearing Văn Cao sing the song and asked each person to write another song for "The Viet Minh Frontline". He posted his own "Diệt Phát Xít", meaning "Killing Fascists". Văn Cao wrote "Chiến Sĩ Việt Nam", meaning "Vietnam Soldiers". Both songs are still popular and sung to the public today.<ref name="f" />
===As a national anthem===
On August 17, 1945, Hồ Chí Minh approved Tiến Quân Ca to be officially recognized as the anthem of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
On September 2, 1945, marching was officially performed on the day of the Proclamation of Independence at Ba Đình Square by the Liberation Army band commanded by Đinh Ngọc Liên. At the day before the performance, musicians Dinh Ngoc Lien, Nguyen Huu Hieu, and Văn Cao discussed for changing the two words in "Tiến Quân Ca" in order to shorten the song by shortening the length of the first E pitches in the word "đoàn" and the F in the middle of the word "xác" to make the song more "snappy".<ref></ref>
In 1946, the 1st National Assembly officially recognized "Tiến Quân Ca" as the national anthem. In the first Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Article 3, it states directly about the national anthem. In 1955, the 5th session of the first National Assembly decided to invite authors to participate in another editing of the song.<ref></ref><ref> urltoken Văn Cao had regrets after this because the "heroic spirit" of the song had been lost after being edited.<ref name=a></ref>
After 1975, the government of South Vietnam fell, and on July 2, 1976, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam (in most common situation, the phrase "Viet Cong" actually refers to it) and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam agreed to be reunified into the new Socialist Republic of Vietnam. "Tiến Quân Ca" was chosen as the national anthem. In 1981,<ref></ref> a contest was opened for a new national anthem but after more a year, it was and has never been mentioned again nor are there any official statement about the results. Thus, "Tiến Quân Ca" remains today as the national anthem of Vietnam.
==Copyrighted anthem==
In 2010, Nghiêm Thúy Bằng, the late wife of musician Văn Cao, addressed a letter to the Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism of Vietnam proposing to donate the work "Tien quan ca" to the public, the Party, the National Assembly and the State. This is also the wish of Văn Cao when he was still alive.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref> urltoken Hiến tặng tác phẩm "Tiến quân ca"</ref><ref> urltoken "Hiến tặng Quốc ca là tâm nguyện của ông Văn Cao"</ref>
However, in 2015, the family of Văn Cao, registered the song with the Vietnam Center for Protection of Music Copyright, demanding royalties for all public performances except in certain situations like schools and "important state ceremonies". Văn Cao's eldest son Văn Thao said that his family "never reached consensus on 'gifting' the song, so they authorized the center to collect royalties on his father's songs".<ref></ref>
The copyright announcement has angered many veteran musicians. Nguyen Quang Long says the "anthem must belong to the public, and people should be allowed to sing it without worrying about royalties". Singer Ánh Tuyết, who is best known for her performance of Cao's songs, agrees that the anthem "long ago became a song of the people, so it should be gifted to the people".
On August 25, 2015, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism sent an official letter to the music copyright agency to stop collecting royalties on "Tien quan ca".<ref></ref>
On July 8, 2016, Văn Thao confirmed that he and his family were going to donate the song to their country and people as his father's last wish. A letter, signed by all the legal inheritors in the family, stated that the family would donate the song for free use.<ref> urltoken </ref>
On July 15, 2016, The National Assembly Office held a ceremony in Hanoi to receive the national anthem, donated by family members of Văn Cao, and to bestow the composer with Order of Ho Chi Minh.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref name="hientang"></ref><ref></ref> Also at the ceremony, Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam presented a certificate of merit from the Prime Minister to Nghiêm Thúy Bằng, the composer’s widow, in recognition of her efforts in preserving the composer’s works.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

Tiến Quân Ca, known in English as the Army Marching Song, Song of Marching Army or Song of Advancing Soldiers, is the National Anthem of Vietnam (SRV), both written and composed by Văn Cao in 1944. The "Army Marching Song" was adopted as the national anthem of North Vietnam in 1954, and was adopted as the national anthem of the new unified Vietnam in 1976, following the reunification of both North Vietnam and South Vietnam at the end of the Vietnam War. Though it has two verses, the first one is mainly sung.
