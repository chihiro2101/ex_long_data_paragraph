== Company towns ==
Company towns were once common in British Columbia. Many were large, but never had municipal government and were largely located on company-owned land. A few such as Granisle, Tumbler Ridge and Wells became municipalities, while others have become ghost towns. Among the largest were Anyox, Bralorne, Ocean Falls, Cassiar, Gold Harbour (Tasu) and Kitsault.

Communities in the province of British Columbia, Canada can include incorporated municipality, Indian reserves, unincorporated area or localities. Unincorporated communities can be further classified as recreational or urban.<ref name=BCGazetteer></ref>
