Ransom Everglades School

== History ==
Paul C. Ransom, an educator and New York lawyer, opened Pine Knot Camp in 1896 as a school for boys in Coconut Grove. In 1902 he combined that with a campus in the Adirondacks of New York to create the Adirondack-Florida School, the first migratory boarding school. Ransom emphasized a curriculum based on experiential learning. Students attended classes on the Florida campus in the winter and on the New York campus in fall and spring.<ref>Klepser (2002) p.58</ref><ref name="Parks and Munroe 2004 p. 131">Parks and Munroe (2004) p. 131</ref> The school suspended operations during World War II. After the war the school reopened in 1947. In 1949 the Adirondack campus was shut down and the school continued in Coconut Grove as the Ransom School for Boys.<ref>Klepser (2002) p. 59</ref><ref>Blanc (1979) pp. 58-59 and p. 84.</ref> Ransom School changed from a boarding to a day school in 1972.<ref>Blanc (1979) p. 95.</ref> Its counterpart, the Everglades School for Girls, began in 1955 founded by Marie B. Swenson.<ref>Lovejoy (1969) p.41</ref> The schools merged and took its current name in 1974.
The school continues to be influenced and guided by the values of its founders. Ransom's letter to prospective students, stating an interest only in boys who "believe that they are in the world not so much for what they can get out of it as for what they can put into it" is read to the students at the beginning of the year by the Head of School.<ref></ref>
Meanwhile, inspired by the philosophy of Marie B. Swenson, who opened the Everglades School for Girls to all students, regardless of race, religion, or ethnicity, the school today values a diverse community of learners. According to the school profile, 50% of students hail from multicultural backgrounds and more than 20% speak a language other than English at home.<ref></ref> A financial aid program is able to meet the demonstrated need of all qualified students once they are admitted.<ref></ref>
Ransom Everglades has longstanding community partnerships with Breakthrough Miami,<ref></ref> St. Alban's Child Enrichment Center, Booker T. Washington High School,<ref></ref> ARC of South Florida,<ref></ref> MUVE and the Reclamation Project,<ref></ref> and many other community organizations. After a devastating earthquake struck Haiti in January 2010, students at Ransom Everglades raised almost $30,000 which they donated to relief efforts in that country.<ref></ref>
== Campuses ==
The school occupies two campuses. The "Upper School" (Ransom Campus) serves grades nine through twelve and is located on Main Highway on the shore of Biscayne Bay, the site of the original Pine Knot Camp. This makes it the oldest South Florida school still in its original location.<ref name="Parks and Munroe 2004 p. 131"/> The original site of the Everglades School for Girls is now the "Middle School" campus (Everglades Campus), serving grades six through eight and located on South Bayshore Drive, about one and a half miles from the Upper School. It is not on the water but is in a residential neighborhood and a mile away from the restaurants and shops of Coconut Grove.
Three early twentieth century buildings still stand on the Ransom campus. The pagoda was built in 1902.<ref></ref> It was once the whole school—the place where the original students both learned and lived. Now, the building serves as the Head of School's office, an event and study space, and faculty offices. It's often featured in historic pictures of South Miami, and in 1973 was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.<ref name="Klepser 2002 p.59"/><ref name="Parks and Munroe 2004 p. 131"/><ref> urltoken Historic Preservation Miami web site article on the Ransom School pagoda</ref> Like the Pagoda, the "Ransom Cottage" is constructed from local materials, largely Dade County pine, and is also on the National Register of Historic Places. Built in 1906, the cottage has been used as the infirmary, the Headmaster's residence, and the band room. Restored in 1998, now the cottage is a conference room and meeting space.<ref></ref> In June 2016, Ransom Everglades acquired the La Brisa property adjacent to the Ransom Campus. The 6.9 acre campus includes a restored 1920s home that sits 23 feet above sea level.<ref></ref> According to Penny Townsend, the Head of School, the acquisition of the campus will allow the school to "improve our facilities, add vital greenspace and continue our long tradition of respecting, protecting and learning from the treasures of Old Florida and Miami’s precious coastal ecosystems.”<ref></ref>
Both Campuses are featured in the 1998 movie Wild Things.
== Academics ==
The school offers more than 20 Advanced Placement courses each year, and typically 90% or more of the 900+ AP exams taken each year result in a score of 3 or better.<ref></ref> In the Fall of 2018, 16 Ransom Everglades seniors were named National Merit Semi-Finalists.<ref></ref>
== Athletics ==
The school has a comprehensive athletic program with over 70 teams among 18 interscholastic sports.<ref>Peterson's (2008) p.482</ref> Ransom Everglades has fielded state championship teams in recent years in Water Polo (2014, 2015, 2016, 2019),<ref></ref><ref></ref> Soccer (2015, 2016),<ref></ref><ref></ref> Tennis (2014, 2018),<ref></ref><ref></ref> and Volleyball (2013).<ref></ref>
