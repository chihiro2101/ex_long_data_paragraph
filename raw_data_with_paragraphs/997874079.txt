Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm

==Early years==
Grimm was born at Regensburg, the son of Johann Melchior Grimm (1682–1749), a pastor, and Sibylle Margarete Grimm, (née Koch) (1684–1774). He studied at the University of Leipzig, where he came under the influence of Johann Christian Gottsched and of Johann August Ernesti, to whom he was largely indebted for his critical appreciation of classical literature. When nineteen, he produced a tragedy, Banise, which met with some success. After two years of studying literature and philosophy, he returned to his hometown, where he was attached to the household of Count Schönborn. In 1749, he accompanied his pupil, the young Schönborn, to Paris. There, appointed him as his secretary. Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote in his Confessions that Grimm played a cembalo and acted also as reader to the eldest son of Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, the young hereditary prince of Saxe-Gotha.
His acquaintance with Rousseau Jean-Jacques: The Early Life and Work of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, 1712–1754, p. 276.</ref> This defence of Italian opera established his literary reputation. It is possible that the origin of the pamphlet is partly to be accounted for by his vehement passion for Marie Fel, the prima donna of the Paris Opéra,<ref>Spectacles de Paris, 1752, p. 87</ref> who was one of the few French singers capable of performing Italian arias.<ref>M. Grimm, Lettre sur Omphale, 1752, p. 50.</ref> When she refused him (and stayed in relation with Louis de Cahusac), Grimm fell into lethargy. Rousseau and abbé Raynal took care of him.

In 1753, following the example of the abbé Raynal, and with the latter's encouragement, Grimm began a literary newsletter with various German sovereigns. Mozart at last enjoyed one great success at the Concert Spirituel as a composer with his Symphony No. 31 in D, K. 297 (Paris Symphony), performed on June 18, 1778 "to unanimous acclaim".<ref>Mozart's letter of 3 July 1778, in .</ref>
Mozart kept finding Paris "totally at odds" with his "genius, inclinations, knowledge, and sympathies".<ref>Mozart's letter of 18 July 1778, in .</ref> He kept expressing his deep dislike of the French, their character, their rudeness, their being "frightfully arrogant", and he was "appalled by their general immorality". Like Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Mozart found the French language inherently unmusical and "so damned impossible where music is concerned",<ref>Mozart's letter of 9 July 1778, in .</ref> ironizing that "the devil himself must have invented the language of these people".<ref>Mozart's letter of 31 July 1778, quoted in .</ref> He felt that French music was worthless: "They understand nothing about music",<ref>Letter of 3 July 1778, .</ref> echoing what Leopold had declared during their first visit to Paris: "The whole of French music is not worth a sou".<ref>Leopold's letter of 1 February 1764, quoted in .</ref> He judged their singers inept. "I'm surrounded by nothing but beasts and animals. But how can it be otherwise, for they're just the same in all their actions, emotions, and passions."<ref>Mozart's letter of 1 May 1778, quoted in .</ref>
Suspicious by nature, Mozart ended up distrusting Grimm, while "Grimm himself was bound to find Mozart increasingly baffling as a person — with his curious mixture of self-confidence and dreaminess". Mozart found himself obliged to borrow "as much as fifteen louis d'or" from Grimm. Voltaire's death on 30 May 1778 made clear "the full extent of the yawning void between them". Grimm warned Leopold that the need for continual and intense networking in Paris was too demanding for Wolfgang, "for it is a very tiring thing to run to the four corners of Paris and exhaust oneself in explanations. And then this profession will not please him, because it will keep him from writing, which is what he likes above all things." <ref>Grimm, as quoted by Leopold in his letter of 13 August 1778, in .</ref> Their dealings "ended on a note of the deepest disharmony." Leopold agreed that Mozart should leave Paris: "You don't like Paris, and on the whole I don't blame you . My next letter will tell you that you are to leave Paris."<ref>Leopold's letter of 31 August 1778, in .</ref> Grimm organized for Mozart's trip to Strasbourg,<ref> urltoken Mozart letters from Paris, Nancy, Strasbourg, Mannheim, Munchen</ref> promising a diligence to cover the trip in five days, but forced Mozart to travel by stagecoach, a journey that took twelve days. Mozart "himself left the city on 26 September, as ill-tempered and disgruntled as when he had arrived there." Mozart broke the journey in Nancy on 3 October, finally arriving in Strasbourg on 14 October 1778.
In the course of his three visits, Mozart spent a total of 13 months in Paris, all of them under the guidance and assistance of Grimm.
===Catherine II of Russia===
Grimm's introduction to Catherine II of Russia took place at Saint Petersburg in 1773, when he was in the suite of Natalia Alexeievna of Russia on the occasion of her marriage to the Paul of Russia. A few weeks later Diderot arrived. On 1 November they both became members of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Because of his atheism, Diderot had little success in the imperial capital, and when he criticized Catharine's style of governing, Grimm moved away from him. According to Jonathan Israel, Grimm was a representative of the Enlightened Absolutism. Grimm introduced Ferdinando Galiani and Cesare Beccaria, and promoted Jean Huber and Johann Friedrich Reiffenstein in the Russian Empire. He became minister of Saxe-Gotha at the French court in 1776. In 1777, he again visited Saint Petersburg, where he remained for nearly a year.
Grimm loved to play chess and cards with the empress. According to Simon Dixon, he influenced Catherine with his ideas on Rousseau.<ref>Simon Dixon (2009) Catherine the Great, p. 222.</ref> He acted as Paris agent for the empress in the purchase of works of art, and executed many confidential commissions for her. With his help, the libraries of Diderot (in 1766) and Voltaire (in 1778) were bought and sent to the Russian capital. In 1779, he introduced Giacomo Quarenghi as an architect and Clodion as a sculptor, when Étienne Maurice Falconet came back to Paris. In 1787, Catherine asked Grimm to burn her letters to him, "or else put them in safekeeping, so that no one can unearth them for a century."<ref> urltoken Inna Gorbatov, Catherine the Great and the French Philosophers of the Enlightenment, Academica Press Bethesda, MD, 1955, p. 223</ref>
===Chevalier de Saint-Georges===
Like Christoph Willibald von Gluck and Ranieri de' Calzabigi, Grimm was occupied with operatic reform. Grimm loved theatre, criticized the Comédie Française and praised the private theatre of Madame de Montesson, the wife of his employer.
In 1776, the , the (Paris Opéra), was once again in dire straits. A "consortium of capitalists", to quote the critic Baron Grimm,<ref></ref> proposed Chevalier de Saint-Georges as the next director of the opera. He helped Saint-Georges, living in the adjacent mansion with Madame de Montesson. Mozart spent over two months next to Saint-Georges. The two mansions had a communal garden, a chapel and a theater.<ref> urltoken Les Lotissements de la Chaussée d'Antin</ref>
==Retirement==
From Erinnerungen einer Urgrossmutter, it becomes clear that, in 1792, he left Rue de Mont Blanc (in 1792, during the French Revolution, rue de la Chaussée d'Antin was renamed rue du Mont-Blanc, after the department of that name. It regained its original name in 1815), and settled in Gotha, living in the ducal palace Friedenstein Castle. His poverty was relieved by Catherine, who shortly before her death appointed him minister of Russia at Hamburg. Although not very thrilled, he travelled with Émilie de Belsunce, Mme d'Épinay's granddaughter, later Comtesse de Bueil. When he suddenly became blind on 17 January 1797, he gave up his new post. (Grimm had problems with his eyesight since 1762.) He and the young Émily stayed a few weeks in Altona. They travelled to Braunschweig where they stayed from the summer of 1797 until June 1800, and where Émilie was tutored by Willem Bilderdijk. Grimm was then invited again by Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. He died at Gotha on 19 December 1807.
The main-belt asteroid 6912 Grimm was named after him.
==Works==
Grimm's , was edited, with many excisions, by Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Suard and published at Paris in 1812, in 6 vols. 8vo; , in 1812 in 5 vols. 8vo; and , in 1813 in 5 vols. 8vo. A supplementary volume appeared in 1814; the whole correspondence was collected and published by , with the assistance of A. Chaudé, in a (Paris, 1829, 15 vols. 8vo); and the was published in 1829. The standard edition was that of Jean Maurice Tourneux (16 vols., 1877–1882). It is now being replaced by the new edition published by Ulla Kölving at the , Ferney-Voltaire.
Grimm's , and Catherine's correspondence with Grimm (1774–1796) were published by J. Grot in 1880, in the collection of the Russian Imperial Historical Society. She treats him very familiarly and calls him Heraclite, Georges Dandin, etc. At the time of the Revolution, she begged him to destroy her letters, but he refused, and after his death, they were returned to Saint Petersburg. Grimm's side of the correspondence, however, is only partially preserved. He signs himself "Pleureur". Some of Grimm's letters, besides the official correspondence, are included in the edition of Tourneux; others are contained in the Erinnerungen einer Urgrossmutter of Katharina von Bechtolsheim, edited (Berlin, 1902) by Count C. Oberndorff.
