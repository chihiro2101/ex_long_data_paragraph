Tetralogy of Fallot

==Treatment==
===Tet spells===
Tet spells may be treated with beta-blockers such as propranolol, but acute episodes require rapid intervention with morphine or intranasal fentanyl<ref></ref> to reduce ventilatory drive, a vasopressor such as phenylephrine, or norepinephrine to increase systemic vascular resistance, and IV fluids for volume expansion.<ref name="Munoz_2010"></ref>
Oxygen (100%) may be effective in treating spells because it is a potent pulmonary vasodilator and systemic vasoconstrictor. This allows more blood flow to the lungs by decreasing shunting of deoxygenated blood from the right to left ventricle through the VSD. There are also simple procedures such as squatting and the knee chest position which increase systemic vascular resistance and decrease right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood into the systemic circulation.<ref name="Munoz_2010" /><ref></ref>
If the spells are refractory to the above treatments, people are usually intubated and sedated. The treatment of last resort for tet spells is extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) along with consideration of Blalock Taussig shunt (BT shunt).<ref name="Munoz_2010" />
===Total surgical repair===
Total surgical repair of TOF is a curative surgery. Different techniques can be used in performing TOF repair. However, a transatrial, transpulmonary artery approach is used for most cases.<ref name = "Mavroudis_2015"></ref> The repair consists of two main steps: closure of the VSD with a patch and reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract.<ref name="Corno_2009" />
This open-heart surgery is designed to relieve the right ventricular outflow tract stenosis by careful resection of muscle and to repair the VSD.<ref name = "Mavroudis_2015" /> Additional reparative or reconstructive surgery may be done on patients as required by their particular cardiac anatomy.<ref name = "Mavroudis_2015" />
Timing of surgery in asymptomatic patients is usually between the ages of 2 months to one year.<ref name="Munoz_2010" /> However, in symptomatic patients showing worsening blood oxygen levels, severe tet-spells (cyanotic spells), or dependence on prostaglandins from early neonatal period (to keep the ductus arteriosus open) need to be planned fairly urgently<ref name="Munoz_2010" />
Potential surgical repair complications include residual ventricular septal defect, residual outflow tract obstruction, complete atrioventricular block, arrhythmias, aneurysm of right ventricular outflow patch, and pulmonary valve insufficiency.<ref name="Corno_2009" /> Long term complications most commonly include pulmonary valve regurgitation, and arrhythmias.<ref name="Chessa_2012" />
Total repair of tetralogy of Fallot initially carried a high mortality risk, but this risk has gone down steadily over the years. Surgery is now often carried out in infants one year of age or younger with less than 5% perioperative mortality.<ref name="Munoz_2010" /> Post surgery, most patients enjoy an active life free of symptoms.<ref name="Munoz_2010" /> Currently, long term survival is close to 90%.<ref name="Munoz_2010" /> Today the adult TOF population continues to grow and is one of the most common congenital heart defects seen in adult outpatient clinics.<ref name="Roos-Hesselink_2017_100" />
===Palliative surgery===
Initially surgery involved forming a side to end anastomosis between the subclavian artery and the pulmonary artery -i.e a systemic to pulmonary arterial shunt.<ref name="Corno_2009"></ref> This redirected a large portion of the partially oxygenated blood leaving the heart for the body into the lungs, increasing flow through the pulmonary circuit, and relieving symptoms. The first Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt surgery was performed on 15-month-old Eileen Saxon on November 29, 1944 with dramatic results.<ref name="JHMI"></ref>
The Potts shunt<ref name="pmid15619282"></ref> and the Waterston-Cooley shunt<ref name="pmid15854971"></ref><ref name="urlSystemic to Pulmonary Artery Shunting for Palliation: - eMedicine"></ref> are other shunt procedures which were developed for the same purpose. These are no longer used.
Currently, palliative surgery is not normally performed on infants with TOF except for extreme cases.<ref name="Abdulla_2011" /> For example, in symptomatic infants, a two-stage repair (initial systemic to arterial shunt placement followed by total surgical repair) may be done.<ref></ref> Potential complications include inadequate pulmonary blood flow, pulmonary artery distortion, inadequate growth of the pulmonary arteries, and acquired pulmonary atresia.<ref name="Corno_2009" />
==Prognosis==
Untreated, tetralogy of Fallot rapidly results in progressive right ventricular hypertrophy due to the increased resistance caused by narrowing of the pulmonary trunk.<ref name="Munoz_2010" /> This progresses to heart failure which begins in the right ventricle and often leads to left heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy. Mortality rate depends on the severity of the tetralogy of Fallot. If left untreated, TOF carries a 35% mortality rate in the first year of life, and a 50% mortality rate in the first three years of life.<ref name="Chessa_2012"/> Patients with untreated TOF rarely progress to adulthood.<ref name="Chessa_2012"></ref>
Patients who have undergone total surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot have improved hemodynamics and often have good to excellent cardiac function after the operation with some to no exercise intolerance (New York Heart Association Class I-II).<ref name="Cobanoglu_2002"></ref> Long-term outcome is usually excellent for most patients, however residual post-surgical defects -such as pulmonary regurgitation, pulmonary artery stenosis, residual VSD, right ventricular dysfunction, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction - may affect life expectancy and increase the need for reoperation.<ref name="Munoz_2010" />
Within 30 years after correction, 50% of patients will require reoperation.<ref name="Chessa_2012" /> The most common cause of reoperation is a leaky pulmonary valve (Pulmonary insufficiency).<ref name="Chessa_2012" /> This is usually corrected with a procedure called Valve replacement.<ref name="Francois_2016" />
==Epidemiology==
Tetralogy of Fallot occurs approximately 400 times per million live births.<ref name="pmid15234430"></ref> It accounts for 7 to 10% of all congenital heart abnormalities, making it the most common cyanotic heart defect.<ref name="Roos-Hesselink_2017_100"></ref> Males and females are affected equally.<ref name="NIH2011What" /> Genetically it is most commonly associated with Down's syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome.<ref name="Roos-Hesselink_2017" /><ref name="Francois_2016" />
==History==
Tetralogy of Fallot was initially described in 1671 by Niels Stensen.<ref name=Name2016/><ref name=VanP2009/> A further description was published in 1888 by the French physician Etienne Fallot, after whom it is named.<ref name=Name2016/><ref name=Fallot1888/> In 1924, Maude Abbott coined the term "tetralogy of Fallot".<ref></ref>
The first surgical repair was carried out in 1944 at Johns Hopkins.<ref></ref> The procedure was conducted by surgeon Alfred Blalock and cardiologist Helen B. Taussig, with Vivien Thomas also providing substantial contributions and listed as an assistant.<ref name=War2005/> This first surgery was depicted in the film Something the Lord Made.<ref name="JHMI" /> It was actually Helen Taussig who convinced Alfred Blalock that the shunt was going to work. 15-month-old Eileen Saxon was the first person to receive a Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt.<ref name="JHMI" /> Furthermore, the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig procedure, initially the only surgical treatment available for tetralogy of Fallot, was palliative but not curative. The first total repair of tetralogy of Fallot was done by a team led by C. Walton Lillehei at the University of Minnesota in 1954 on an 11-year-old boy.<ref name="PMC1465089"></ref> Total repair on infants has had success from 1981, with research indicating that it has a comparatively low mortality rate.<ref name="Cobanoglu_2002" /> Today the adult TOF population continues to grow and is one of the most common congenital heart defect seen in adult outpatient clinics.<ref name="Roos-Hesselink_2017_100" />

Echocardiography establishes the presence of TOF by demonstrating a VSD, RVH, and aortic override. Many patients are diagnosed prenatally. Color Doppler (type of echocardiography) measures the degree of pulmonary stenosis. Additionally, close monitoring of the ductus arteriosus is done in the neonatal period to ensure that there is adequate blood flow through the pulmonary valve.<ref name="Francois_2016" /><ref name="Abdulla_2011" />
In certain cases, coronary artery anatomy cannot be clearly viewed using echocardiogram. In this case, cardiac catheterization can be done.<ref name="Munoz_2010" />
Form a genetics perspective, it is important to screen for DiGeorge in all babies with TOF.<ref name="Munoz_2010" />
Before more sophisticated techniques became available, chest x-ray was the definitive method of diagnosis. The abnormal "coeur-en-sabot" (boot-like) appearance of a heart with tetralogy of Fallot is classically visible via chest x-ray, although most infants with tetralogy may not show this finding.<ref></ref> The boot like shape is due to the right ventricular hypertrophy present in TOF. Lung fields are often dark (absence of interstitial lung markings) due to decreased pulmonary blood flow.<ref name="Abdulla_2011" />
Electrocardiography shows right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), along with right axis deviation.<ref name="Francois_2016" /> RVH is noted on EKG as tall R-waves in lead V1 and deep S-waves in lead V5-V6.<ref></ref>
