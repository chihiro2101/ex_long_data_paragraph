== History ==
Château du Rosey, a Feudal chateau located on Le Rosey's main campus at Rolle, dates to the Middle Ages and houses Le Rosey's central reception area.<ref></ref> 
In 1880, the site of the Le Rosey campus was chosen by the school's founder, Paul-Emile Carnal, "a lover of nature, history and the countryside". The Le Rosey campus at Rolle is situated adjacent to the famous Lake Geneva. In 1911, the founder passed the ownership of Le Rosey to his son, Henri-Paul Carnal. In 1917, the school began to go to Gstaad in the German-speaking canton of Berne for the winter months to escape the dense fog that settles in on Lake Geneva.<ref></ref> In 1947, the third generation of directors, Louis Johannot and Helen Schaub, assumed ownership of Le Rosey. Under the same ownership, in 1967, Le Rosey admitted girls for the first time and opened a separate girls' campus. In 1980, the current owners, Philippe and Anne Gudin de la Sablonnière, became the fourth generation of Directors at Le Rosey. Louis Johannot, in an interview with Life Magazine in 1965, made a comment that received considerable attention: "The only reason I always try to meet and know the parents better is because it helps me to forgive their children."<ref></ref>
Prior to the introduction of the 10% quota, wherein no more than 10% of the student body may come from one country, different nationalities made up the majority of students at Le Rosey.<ref name="members.forbes.com"></ref> In the 1950s and 1960s, the majority of students were Americans, Italians, and Greeks, in the 1970s came the Arabs and Iranians, in the 1980s came the Japanese and Koreans, and in the 1990s came the Russians.<ref name="members.forbes.com"/> During the 1990s, the children of Russian oligarchs, who made up a third of the student body,<ref></ref> gained notoriety for "terrorizing" other students, something that is disputed, resulting in the withdrawal of at least one non-Russian student.<ref name="members.forbes.com"/><ref></ref>

== Plans to leave Gstaad ==
In January 2008, Swiss economics magazine Bilanz, a subsidiary of Edipresse, published an interview with Le Rosey Director-General Philippe Gudin that revealed the school is seeking to sell its Gstaad winter campus and build a new campus in another location.<ref name="Le Rosey songe à quitter Gstaad" /> Gudin is in negotiations with the local authorities in Schönried, a suburb of Gstaad located a few minutes away, to construct a new main campus on an undeveloped piece of land, but has run into difficulties due to zoning restrictions.<ref name="Le Rosey songe à quitter Gstaad" /> Reasons for moving to a new campus, according to the Director-General, include the fact that the school's personnel, who typically live on campus, are at maximum capacity, and that the student body can no longer increase in size due to the lack of space.<ref name="Le Rosey songe à quitter Gstaad" /> Gudin stated that for the moment the new winter campus location will be in Switzerland, but he has not ruled out the French Alps.<ref name="Le Rosey songe à quitter Gstaad" /> The of prime real estate that the school occupies on Ried Hill in the centre of Gstaad is estimated to be worth several hundreds of millions of USD, considering the International Herald Tribune reports that the price per square meter in Gstaad starts at 20,000 CHF (19,000 US$) and can rise to 45,000 CHF (43,000 US$). Gudin asserts that the high value of the Gstaad winter campus has nothing to do with its planned sale.<ref name="Le Rosey songe à quitter Gstaad" />
