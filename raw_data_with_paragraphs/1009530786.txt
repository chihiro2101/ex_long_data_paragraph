Toronto, New South Wales

==History==
The Aboriginal people, in this area, the Awabakal, were the first people of this land.<ref></ref>
The area was originally the site of an Aboriginal mission called Ebenezer, established in 1829 by Reverend Threlkeld. Threlkeld is reported to have begun construction of his chimney with a local black stone which he later realised was coal. Coal Point, just to the south, is named after this discovery. The development of several coal mines in the region, proximity to the nearby city of Newcastle, and its position by the lake led to gradual development and population increases. The mission closed in 1841.
In 1885, the Excelsior Land, Investment and Building Co. and Bank Ltd acquired a portion of Threlkelds' original 1,280 acre grant from McMahon and Whiting plus the 100&nbsp;ft waterfront reserve from the Crown for £13,722 and subdivided it in 1887. 
Ebenezer was then renamed after Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in honour of Ned Hanlan, a Canadian world-champion sculler who visited Australia in 1884.<ref name="HistoryOfTorontoLakeMac">
</ref> The area's subdividers, the Excelsior Company, named the land in honour of Hanlan's visit, which coincided with the opening of the subdivision. Name of Toronto is said to have come from the Mohawk language tkaronto, meaning “where there are trees standing in the water”.<ref name="etymology"></ref>
This subdivision also coincided with the opening of the Great Northern Railway and became the basis of the future town of Toronto. The Edward VIII, later Edward VIII, visited Toronto by train on the Toronto railway line on 24 June 1920.

Toronto has an ambulance station, police station, Fire Brigade and a Court House that serve the Western Lake Macquarie area.
==The Boulevarde==
Toronto has a high street called The Boulevarde. This road starts at the foreshore, forming a junction with Victory Parade. This road stretches westwards for 1.2 kilometres, and is the commercial hub for Toronto and its surrounding areas.
The section of the road between the foreshore and Cary Street is the main retail area for Toronto. There are many boutique shops on this strip.
Over the years, the streetscape has degraded and in 2013, Lake Macquarie City Council decided to start renewing the streetscape.<ref></ref> This process began by cutting down the famous figs that line the street, and then replacing the walkways and planting more controllable trees. Work will continue into 2018.
==Victory Parade==
;The War Memorial - Unveiled by Lt. Col. BURNAGE, 30 September 1922
Soon after its unveiling in Victory Parade, the Monument was found to be a traffic hazard, so it was moved closer to the footpath (at the entrance to the pedestrian bridge over the railway line). In 1959 it was moved to Edward Gain Park, near Wharf Street. Then in the 1964, when there was a proposal to take some of this park for a road, the Monument was moved to Goffet Park. However, no matter where it has been located, the Monument has always been the focal point for the Anzac Day and Remembrance Day services in Toronto.
;Victory Theatre
NMH 2.2.1921:7 - Toronto is to have a Picture Theatre 90&nbsp;ft by 40&nbsp;ft wide – Mr J Chapman has contract. Located in Victory Parade, Toronto opposite the Railway Station.
Commenced screening on Wednesday 19 July 1922 by Mr George W Goffett. After having several owners, it was bought by Mr & Mrs P Crethary around 1951. CinemaScope was installed about the mid 1950s, it was the first theatre outside Newcastle to have it. 
The theatre closed on Saturday 12 August 1961. The last films screened were "The Angry Silence" and "The Gunslinger".
The building was used by a variety of businesses including Inskip Motorcycles until 1984.
The building no longer exists, as it was destroyed by fire in the early 1990s.
;Hotel Toronto
Built in 1887 from locally-made bricks, the Toronto Hotel has been the best-known landmark throughout the entire history of the township.
The Excelsior Company enthusiastically promoted it as "a pleasant and commodious brick building, containing about thirty bedrooms, besides parlors, bar, dining and billiard rooms, &c. Standing on one of the prettiest spots upon the shores of the Lake, in its own grounds of some twenty acres, the hotel commands a fine view of a splendid reach of water extending to the little village of Belmont. The extensive pleasure grounds are laid out with croquet lawns, lawn tennis court, bowling greens, &c. A spacious dancing pavilion has been erected for devotees of Terpsichore, while the lovers of the green cloth are provided with an excellent billiard table."
Now on the Register of the National Estate, the Hotel has undergone numerous alterations and renovations throughout its lifetime. It no longer dominates the skyline as it did in years gone by. Healthy and vigorous trees growing in Regatta Walk render the Hotel barely visible from Toronto's public baths and private jetties.
