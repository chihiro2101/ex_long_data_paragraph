Type 2 diabetes

==Signs and symptoms==
The classic symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination (polyuria), increased thirst (polydipsia), increased hunger (polyphagia), and weight loss.<ref name=Vij2010></ref> Other symptoms that are commonly present at diagnosis include a history of blurred vision, pruritus, peripheral neuropathy, recurrent vulvovaginitis, and fatigue.<ref name=Green2011/> Other symptoms may include loss of taste.<ref></ref> Many people, however, have no symptoms during the first few years and are diagnosed on routine testing.<ref name=Green2011/> A small number of people with type&nbsp;2 diabetes can develop a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (a condition of very high blood sugar associated with a decreased level of consciousness and hypotension).<ref name=Green2011/>
===Complications===
Type 2 diabetes is typically a chronic disease associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy.<ref name=Will2011/> This is partly due to a number of complications with which it is associated, including: two to four times the risk of cardiovascular disease, including ischemic heart disease and stroke; a 20-fold increase in lower limb amputations, and increased rates of hospitalizations.<ref name=Will2011/> In the developed world, and increasingly elsewhere, type&nbsp;2&nbsp;diabetes is the largest cause of nontraumatic blindness and kidney failure.<ref name=AFP09/> It has also been associated with an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia through disease processes such as Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.<ref></ref> Other complications include hyperpigmentation of skin (acanthosis nigricans), sexual dysfunction, and frequent infections.<ref name=Vij2010/> There is also an association between type 2 diabetes and mild hearing loss.<ref></ref>
==Causes==
The development of type&nbsp;2 diabetes is caused by a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors.<ref name=AFP09/><ref name=Fat2009></ref> While some of these factors are under personal control, such as diet and obesity, other factors are not, such as increasing age, female gender, and genetics.<ref name=Will2011/> Obesity is more common in women than men in many parts of Africa.<ref></ref> The nutritional status of a mother during fetal development may also play a role, with one proposed mechanism being that of DNA methylation.<ref></ref> The intestinal bacteria Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus have been connected with type&nbsp;2 diabetes.<ref></ref>
===Lifestyle===
Lifestyle factors are important to the development of type&nbsp;2 diabetes, including obesity and being overweight (defined by a body mass index of greater than 25), lack of physical activity, poor diet, stress, and urbanization.<ref name=Will2011/><ref></ref> Excess body fat is associated with 30% of cases in those of Chinese and Japanese descent, 60–80% of cases in those of European and African descent, and 100% of cases in Pima Indians and Pacific Islanders.<ref name=Green2011/> Among those who are not obese, a high waist–hip ratio is often present.<ref name=Green2011/> Smoking appears to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.<ref></ref> A lack of sleep has also been linked to type&nbsp;2 diabetes.<ref name=Sleep2011></ref> Laboratory studies have linked short-term sleep deprivations to changes in glucose metabolism, nervous system activity, or hormonal factors that may lead to diabetes.<ref name=Sleep2011/>
Dietary factors also influence the risk of developing type&nbsp;2 diabetes. Consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks in excess is associated with an increased risk.<ref name=SSB2010></ref><ref></ref> The type of fats in the diet are important, with saturated fats and trans fatty acids increasing the risk, and polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat decreasing the risk.<ref name=Fat2009 /> Eating a lot of white rice appears to play a role in increasing risk.<ref></ref> A lack of exercise is believed to cause 7% of cases.<ref></ref> Persistent organic pollutants may also play a role.<ref></ref>
===Genetics===
Most cases of diabetes involve many genes, with each being a small contributor to an increased probability of becoming a type&nbsp;2 diabetic.<ref name=Will2011/> The proportion of diabetes that is inherited is estimated at 72%.<ref name=Will2016></ref> More than 36&nbsp;genes and 80&nbsp;Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) had been found that contribute to the risk of type&nbsp;2 diabetes.<ref name=Genetic2011></ref><ref></ref> All of these genes together still only account for 10% of the total heritable component of the disease.<ref name=Genetic2011/> The TCF7L2 allele, for example, increases the risk of developing diabetes by 1.5&nbsp;times and is the greatest risk of the common genetic variants.<ref name=Green2011/> Most of the genes linked to diabetes are involved in pancreatic beta cell functions.<ref name=Green2011/>
There are a number of rare cases of diabetes that arise due to an abnormality in a single gene (known as monogenic forms of diabetes or Diabetes mellitus#Other types).<ref name=Will2011/><ref name=Green2011/> These include maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), Donohue syndrome, and Rabson–Mendenhall syndrome, among others.<ref name=Will2011/> Maturity onset diabetes of the young constitute 1–5% of all cases of diabetes in young people.<ref></ref>
===Medical conditions===
There are a number of medications and other health problems that can predispose to diabetes.<ref name=BookDM2008></ref> Some of the medications include: glucocorticoids, thiazides, beta blockers, atypical antipsychotics,<ref></ref> and statins.<ref></ref> Those who have previously had gestational diabetes are at a higher risk of developing type&nbsp;2 diabetes.<ref name=Vij2010/> Other health problems that are associated include: acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome, hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, and certain cancers such as glucagonomas.<ref name=BookDM2008/> Individuals with cancer may be at a higher risk of mortality if they also have diabetes.<ref></ref> Testosterone deficiency is also associated with type&nbsp;2 diabetes.<ref name=pmid19444934></ref><ref name=pmid18832284></ref> Eating disorders may also interact with type&nbsp;2 diabetes, with bulimia nervosa increasing the risk and anorexia nervosa decreasing it.<ref></ref>
==Pathophysiology==
Type&nbsp;2 diabetes is due to insufficient insulin production from beta cells in the setting of insulin resistance.<ref name=Green2011/> Insulin resistance, which is the inability of cells to respond adequately to normal levels of insulin, occurs primarily within the muscles, liver, and fat tissue.<ref></ref> In the liver, insulin normally suppresses glucose release. However, in the setting of insulin resistance, the liver inappropriately releases glucose into the blood.<ref name=Will2011/> The proportion of insulin resistance versus beta cell dysfunction differs among individuals, with some having primarily insulin resistance and only a minor defect in insulin secretion and others with slight insulin resistance and primarily a lack of insulin secretion.<ref name=Green2011/>
Other potentially important mechanisms associated with type&nbsp;2 diabetes and insulin resistance include: increased breakdown of lipids within fat cells, resistance to and lack of incretin, high glucagon levels in the blood, increased retention of salt and water by the kidneys, and inappropriate regulation of metabolism by the central nervous system.<ref name=Will2011/> However, not all people with insulin resistance develop diabetes since an impairment of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells is also required.<ref name=Green2011/>
In the early stages of insulin resistance, the mass of beta cells expands, increasing the output of insulin to compensate for the insulin insensitivity.<ref name="pmid31831356"></ref> But when type 2 diabetes has become manifest, a type 2 diabetic will have lost about half of their beta cells.<ref name="pmid31831356" />
Fatty acids in the beta cells activate FOXO1, resulting in apopotosis of the beta cells.<ref name="pmid31831356" />
==Diagnosis==
The World Health Organization definition of diabetes (both type&nbsp;1 and type&nbsp;2) is for a single raised glucose reading with symptoms, otherwise raised values on two occasions, of either:<ref name=who-99></ref>
* fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0&nbsp;mmol/l (126&nbsp;mg/dl)
:or
* with a glucose tolerance test, two hours after the oral dose a plasma glucose ≥ 11.1&nbsp;mmol/l (200&nbsp;mg/dl)
A random blood sugar of greater than 11.1&nbsp;mmol/l (200&nbsp;mg/dl) in association with typical symptoms<ref name=Vij2010/> or a glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) of ≥&nbsp;48&nbsp;mmol/mol (≥&nbsp;6.5 DCCT %) is another method of diagnosing diabetes.<ref name=Will2011/> In 2009 an International Expert Committee that included representatives of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommended that a threshold of ≥&nbsp;48&nbsp;mmol/mol (≥&nbsp;6.5 DCCT %) should be used to diagnose diabetes.<ref name=Expert2009/> This recommendation was adopted by the American Diabetes Association in 2010.<ref></ref> Positive tests should be repeated unless the person presents with typical symptoms and blood sugars >11.1&nbsp;mmol/l (>200&nbsp;mg/dl).<ref name=Expert2009></ref>
Threshold for diagnosis of diabetes is based on the relationship between results of glucose tolerance tests, fasting glucose or HbA<sub>1c</sub> and complications such as retinopathy.<ref name=Will2011/> A fasting or random blood sugar is preferred over the glucose tolerance test, as they are more convenient for people.<ref name=Will2011/> HbA<sub>1c</sub> has the advantages that fasting is not required and results are more stable but has the disadvantage that the test is more costly than measurement of blood glucose.<ref></ref> It is estimated that 20% of people with diabetes in the United States do not realize that they have the disease.<ref name=Will2011/>
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by high blood glucose in the context of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency.<ref name="Pathologic Basis of Disease"></ref> This is in contrast to type 1 diabetes in which there is an absolute insulin deficiency due to destruction of islet cells in the pancreas and gestational diabetes that is a new onset of high blood sugars associated with pregnancy.<ref name="Green2011"/> Type&nbsp;1 and type&nbsp;2 diabetes can typically be distinguished based on the presenting circumstances.<ref name=Expert2009/> If the diagnosis is in doubt antibody testing may be useful to confirm type&nbsp;1 diabetes and C-peptide levels may be useful to confirm type&nbsp;2 diabetes,<ref></ref> with C-peptide levels normal or high in type&nbsp;2 diabetes, but low in type&nbsp;1 diabetes.<ref></ref>
==Screening==
No major organization recommends universal screening for diabetes as there is no evidence that such a program improve outcomes.<ref name=Screen09></ref><ref name=Selph_et_al-2015></ref> Screening is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in adults without symptoms whose blood pressure is greater than 135/80&nbsp;mmHg.<ref name=US08></ref> For those whose blood pressure is less, the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening.<ref name=US08/> There is no evidence that it changes the risk of death in this group of people.<ref name=Selph_et_al-2015/> They also recommend screening among those who are overweight and between the ages of 40 and 70.<ref></ref>
The World Health Organization recommends testing those groups at high risk<ref name=Screen09/> and in 2014 the USPSTF is considering a similar recommendation.<ref></ref> High-risk groups in the United States include: those over 45 years old; those with a first degree relative with diabetes; some ethnic groups, including Hispanics, African-Americans, and Native-Americans; a history of gestational diabetes; polycystic ovary syndrome; excess weight; and conditions associated with metabolic syndrome.<ref name="Vij2010" /> The American Diabetes Association recommends screening those who have a BMI over 25 (in people of Asian descent screening is recommended for a BMI over 23).<ref name=ADA21015></ref>
==Prevention==
Onset of type&nbsp;2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented through proper nutrition and regular exercise.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Intensive lifestyle measures may reduce the risk by over half.<ref name=AFP09/><ref name=Schellenberg2013></ref> The benefit of exercise occurs regardless of the person's initial weight or subsequent weight loss.<ref></ref> High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of diabetes by about 28%.<ref name=BMJ2016></ref> Evidence for the benefit of dietary changes alone, however, is limited,<ref></ref> with some evidence for a diet high in green leafy vegetables<ref></ref> and some for limiting the intake of sugary drinks.<ref name="Schwing"></ref> There is an association between higher intake of sugar-sweetened fruit juice and diabetes, but no evidence of an association with 100% fruit juice.<ref></ref> A 2019 review found evidence of benefit from dietary fiber.<ref></ref>
In those with impaired glucose tolerance, diet and exercise either alone or in combination with metformin or acarbose may decrease the risk of developing diabetes.<ref name=AFP09/><ref name=AHRQ05></ref> Lifestyle interventions are more effective than metformin.<ref name=AFP09/> A 2017 review found that, long term, lifestyle changes decreased the risk by 28%, while medication does not reduce risk after withdrawal.<ref></ref> While low vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of diabetes, correcting the levels by supplementing vitamin D3 does not improve that risk.<ref></ref>
==Management==
Management of type&nbsp;2 diabetes focuses on lifestyle interventions, lowering other cardiovascular risk factors, and maintaining blood glucose levels in the normal range.<ref name=AFP09></ref> Self-monitoring of blood glucose for people with newly diagnosed type&nbsp;2 diabetes may be used in combination with education,<ref name=NICE2009Self></ref> although the benefit of self-monitoring in those not using multi-dose insulin is questionable.<ref name=AFP09/> In those who do not want to measure blood levels, measuring urine levels may be done.<ref name=NICE2009Self/> Managing other cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, and microalbuminuria, improves a person's life expectancy.<ref name=AFP09/> Decreasing the systolic blood pressure to less than 140&nbsp;mmHg is associated with a lower risk of death and better outcomes.<ref></ref> Intensive blood pressure management (less than 130/80&nbsp;mmHg) as opposed to standard blood pressure management (less than 140-160 mmHg systolic to 85–100 mmHg diastolic) results in a slight decrease in stroke risk but no effect on overall risk of death.<ref></ref>
Intensive blood sugar lowering (HbA<sub>1c</sub><6%) as opposed to standard blood sugar lowering (HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 7–7.9%) does not appear to change mortality.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The goal of treatment is typically an HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 7 to 8% or a fasting glucose of less than 7.2&nbsp;mmol/L (130&nbsp;mg/dl); however these goals may be changed after professional clinical consultation, taking into account particular risks of hypoglycemia and life expectancy.<ref name=ADA21015 /><ref name=ADA2015/><ref></ref> Hypoglycemia is associated with adverse outcomes in older people with type 2 diabetes.<ref></ref> Despite guidelines recommending that intensive blood sugar control be based on balancing immediate harms with long-term benefits, many people&nbsp;– for example people with a life expectancy of less than nine years who will not benefit, are over-treated.<ref></ref>
It is recommended that all people with type&nbsp;2 diabetes get regular eye examinations.<ref name=Green2011/> There is weak evidence suggesting that treating gum disease by scaling and root planing may result in a small short-term improvement in blood sugar levels for people with diabetes.<ref name=Simpson2015></ref> There is no evidence to suggest that this improvement in blood sugar levels is maintained longer than four months.<ref name=Simpson2015 /> There is also not enough evidence to determine if medications to treat gum disease are effective at lowering blood sugar levels.<ref name=Simpson2015 />
===Lifestyle===
A proper diet and exercise are the foundations of diabetic care,<ref name=Vij2010/> with a greater amount of exercise yielding better results.<ref></ref> Exercise improves blood sugar control, decreases body fat content and decreases blood lipid levels, and these effects are evident even without weight loss.<ref></ref> Aerobic exercise leads to a decrease in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and improved insulin sensitivity.<ref name=Exercise10/> Strength training is also useful and the combination of both types of exercise may be most effective.<ref name=Exercise10></ref>
A diabetic diet which includes calorie restriction to promote weight loss is generally recommended.<ref name=Diet09></ref><ref name="ADA2015-2"></ref> Other recommendations include emphasizing intake of fruits, vegetables, reduced saturated fat and low-fat dairy products, and with a macronutrient intake tailored to the individual, to distribute calories and carbohydrates throughout the day.<ref name="ADA2015-2" /><ref name="ADA2013-nutrition"></ref> Several diets may be effective such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean diet, low-fat diet, or low glycemic index diet such as a low carbohydrate diet.<ref name="ADA2015-2" /><ref></ref><ref></ref> Viscous fiber supplements may be useful in those with diabetes.<ref></ref>
Vegetarianism in general have been related to lower diabetes risk, but do not offer advantages compared with diets which allow moderate amounts of animal products.<ref name=GlickBauerYeh2014></ref> There is not enough evidence to suggest that cinnamon improves blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes.<ref></ref>
Culturally appropriate education may help people with type&nbsp;2 diabetes control their blood sugar levels, for up to 24 months.<ref></ref> If changes in lifestyle in those with mild diabetes has not resulted in improved blood sugars within six weeks, medications should then be considered.<ref name=Vij2010/> There is not enough evidence to determine if lifestyle interventions affect mortality in those who already have DM2.<ref name=Schellenberg2013 />
, there is insufficient data to recommend nonnutritive sweeteners, but note they may help reduce caloric intake.<ref></ref>
===Medications===
==== Blood sugar control ====
There are several classes of anti-diabetic medications available. Metformin is generally recommended as a first line treatment as there is some evidence that it decreases mortality;<ref name="Ann2016" /><ref name="AFP09" /><ref></ref> however, this conclusion is questioned.<ref></ref> Metformin should not be used in those with severe kidney or liver problems.<ref name="Vij2010" />
A second oral agent of another class or insulin may be added if metformin is not sufficient after three months.<ref name=ADA2015></ref> Other classes of medications include: sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs.<ref name=ADA2015/> As of 2015 there was no significant difference between these agents.<ref name=ADA2015/> A 2018 review found that SGLT2 inhibitors may be better than glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors.<ref></ref>
Rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, has not been found to improve long-term outcomes even though it improves blood sugar levels.<ref></ref> Additionally it is associated with increased rates of heart disease and death.<ref></ref>
Injections of insulin may either be added to oral medication or used alone.<ref name=AFP09/> Most people do not initially need insulin.<ref name=Green2011/> When it is used, a long-acting formulation is typically added at night, with oral medications being continued.<ref name=Vij2010/><ref name=AFP09/> Doses are then increased to effect (blood sugar levels being well controlled).<ref name=AFP09/> When nightly insulin is insufficient, twice daily insulin may achieve better control.<ref name=Vij2010/> The long acting insulins glargine and detemir are equally safe and effective,<ref></ref> and do not appear much better than neutral protamine Hagedorn NPH insulin, but as they are significantly more expensive, they are not cost effective as of 2010.<ref></ref> In those who are pregnant, insulin is generally the treatment of choice.<ref name=Vij2010/>
==== Blood pressure lowering ====
Many international guidelines recommend blood pressure treatment targets that are lower than 140/90&nbsp;mmHg for people with diabetes.<ref></ref> However, there is only limited evidence regarding what the lower targets should be. A 2016 systematic review found potential harm to treating to targets lower than 140 mmHg,<ref></ref> and a subsequent review in 2019 found no evidence of additional benefit from blood pressure lowering to between 130 - 140mmHg, although there was an increased risk of adverse events.<ref></ref>
2015 American Diabetes Association recommendations are that people with diabetes and albuminuria should receive an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system to reduce the risks of progression to end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular events, and death.<ref name=":0"></ref> There is some evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are superior to other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system such as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs),<ref></ref> or aliskiren in preventing cardiovascular disease.<ref></ref> Although a more recent review found similar effects of ACEIs and ARBs on major cardiovascular and renal outcomes.<ref name=":1"></ref> There is no evidence that combining ACEIs and ARBs provides additional benefits.<ref name=":1" />
==== Other ====
The use of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease in diabetes is controversial.<ref name=":0" /> Aspirin is recommended in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease, however routine use of aspirin has not been found to improve outcomes in uncomplicated diabetes.<ref></ref> 2015 American Diabetes Association recommendations for aspirin use (based on expert consensus or clinical experience) are that low-dose aspirin use is reasonable in adults with diabetes who are at intermediate risk of cardiovascular disease (10-year cardiovascular disease risk, 5–10%).<ref name=":0" />
Vitamin D supplementation to people with type 2 diabetes may improve markers of insulin resistance and HbA1c.<ref></ref>
===Surgery===
Bariatric surgery in those who are obese is an effective measure to treat diabetes.<ref></ref> Many are able to maintain normal blood sugar levels with little or no medication following surgery<ref></ref> and long-term mortality is decreased.<ref name=Schum2009/> There however is some short-term mortality risk of less than 1% from the surgery.<ref></ref> The body mass index cutoffs for when surgery is appropriate are not yet clear.<ref name=Schum2009></ref> It is recommended that this option be considered in those who are unable to get both their weight and blood sugar under control.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
==Epidemiology==
Globally as of 2015 it was estimated that there were 392&nbsp;million people with type&nbsp;2 diabetes making up about 90% of diabetes cases.<ref name=Will2011/><ref name=GBD2015Pre/> This is equivalent to about 6% of the world's population.<ref name=GBD2015Pre/> Diabetes is common both in the developed and the developing world.<ref name=Will2011/> It remains uncommon, however, in the least developed countries.<ref name=Green2011/>
Women seem to be at a greater risk as do certain ethnic groups,<ref name=Will2011/><ref></ref> such as South Asians, Pacific Islanders, Latinos, and Native Americans.<ref name=Vij2010/> This may be due to enhanced sensitivity to a Western lifestyle in certain ethnic groups.<ref></ref> Traditionally considered a disease of adults, type&nbsp;2 diabetes is increasingly diagnosed in children in parallel with rising obesity rates.<ref name=Will2011/> Type&nbsp;2 diabetes is now diagnosed as frequently as type&nbsp;1 diabetes in teenagers in the United States.<ref name=Green2011/>
Rates of diabetes in 1985 were estimated at 30&nbsp;million, increasing to 135&nbsp;million in 1995 and 217&nbsp;million in 2005.<ref name=Epi2006/> This increase is believed to be primarily due to the global population aging, a decrease in exercise, and increasing rates of obesity.<ref name=Epi2006/> The five countries with the greatest number of people with diabetes as of 2000 are India having 31.7&nbsp;million, China 20.8&nbsp;million, the United States 17.7&nbsp;million, Indonesia 8.4&nbsp;million, and Japan 6.8&nbsp;million.<ref name = "Wild 2004"></ref> It is recognized as a global epidemic by the World Health Organization.<ref name=WHO2015></ref>
==History==
Diabetes is one of the first diseases described<ref name=Rip2011/> with an Egyptian manuscript from c. 1500 BCE mentioning "too great emptying of the urine."<ref name=History2010/> The first described cases are believed to be of type&nbsp;1 diabetes.<ref name=History2010></ref> Indian physicians around the same time identified the disease and classified it as madhumeha or honey urine noting that the urine would attract ants.<ref name=History2010/> The term "diabetes" or "to pass through" was first used in 230&nbsp;BCE by the Greek Apollonius Memphites.<ref name=History2010/> The disease was rare during the time of the Roman empire with Galen commenting that he had only seen two cases during his career.<ref name=History2010/>
Type&nbsp;1 and type&nbsp;2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions for the first time by the Indian physicians Sushruta and Charaka in 400–500&nbsp;AD with type&nbsp;1 associated with youth and type&nbsp;2 with being overweight.<ref name=History2010/> Effective treatment was not developed until the early part of the 20th century when the Canadians Frederick Banting and Charles Best discovered insulin in 1921 and 1922.<ref name=History2010/> This was followed by the development of the long acting NPH insulin in the 1940s.<ref name=History2010/>
In 1916, Elliot Joslin proposed that in people with diabetes, periods of fasting are helpful.<ref name="Koutroumpakis2019"></ref> Subsequent research has supported this, and weight loss is a first line treatment in type 2 diabetes.<ref name="Koutroumpakis2019" />

Type 2 diabetes (T2D), formerly known as adult-onset diabetes, is a form of diabetes that is characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and relative lack of insulin.<ref name=NIH2014Cause></ref> Common symptoms include polydipsia, polyuria, and unexplained weight loss.<ref name=NIH2014Diag/> Symptoms may also include polyphagia, feeling tired, and sores that do not heal.<ref name=NIH2014Diag/> Often symptoms come on slowly.<ref name=NIH2014Cause/> Long-term complications from high blood sugar include heart disease, strokes, diabetic retinopathy which can result in blindness, kidney failure, and poor blood flow in the limbs which may lead to amputations.<ref name=WHO2015/> The sudden onset of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state may occur; however, ketoacidosis is uncommon.<ref name=Pas2014></ref><ref name=Fas2008></ref>
Type&nbsp;2 diabetes primarily occurs as a result of obesity and lack of exercise.<ref name=WHO2015/> Some people are more Heredity at risk than others.<ref name=NIH2014Cause/>
Type 2 diabetes makes up about 90% of cases of diabetes, with the other 10% due primarily to type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes.<ref name=WHO2015/> In type 1 diabetes there is a lower total level of insulin to control blood glucose, due to an autoimmune induced loss of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.<ref></ref><ref name=Green2011></ref> Diagnosis of diabetes is by blood tests such as fasting plasma glucose, oral glucose tolerance test, or glycated hemoglobin (A1C).<ref name=NIH2014Diag></ref>
Type&nbsp;2 diabetes is largely preventable by staying a normal weight, exercising regularly, and eating properly.<ref name=WHO2015/> Treatment involves exercise and diabetic diet.<ref name=WHO2015/> If blood sugar levels are not adequately lowered, the medication metformin is typically recommended.<ref name=Ann2016></ref><ref name=Fer005></ref> Many people may eventually also require insulin injections.<ref name=Kre2005></ref> In those on insulin, routinely checking blood sugar levels is advised; however, this may not be needed in those taking pills.<ref></ref> Bariatric surgery often improves diabetes in those who are obese.<ref name=Cet2015></ref><ref></ref>
Rates of type&nbsp;2 diabetes have increased markedly since 1960 in parallel with obesity.<ref></ref> As of 2015 there were approximately 392&nbsp;million people diagnosed with the disease compared to around 30&nbsp;million in 1985.<ref name=GBD2015Pre></ref><ref name=Epi2006></ref> Typically it begins in middle or older age,<ref name=NIH2014Cause/> although rates of type 2 diabetes are increasing in young people.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Type 2 diabetes is associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy.<ref name=Will2011></ref> Diabetes was one of the first diseases described.<ref name=Rip2011></ref> The importance of insulin in the disease was determined in the 1920s.<ref></ref>
