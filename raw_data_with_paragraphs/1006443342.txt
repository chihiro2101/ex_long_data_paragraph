Music of the United Kingdom

==Background and classical music==

Lovelock, A Concise History of Music (Frederick Ungar, 1953), p. 57.</ref> Musicians from the British Isles also developed some distinctive forms of music, including Celtic chant, the Contenance Angloise, the rota, polyphonic votive antiphons and the carol in the medieval era.
Church music and religious music were profoundly affected by the Protestant Reformation which affected Britain from the 16th century, which curtailed events associated with British music and forced the development of distinctive national music, worship and belief. English madrigals, lute ayres and masques in the Renaissance era led particularly to English language opera developed in the early Baroque period of the later seventeenth century.<ref>R. H. Fritze and W. Baxter Robison, Historical dictionary of late medieval England, 1272-1485 (Greenwood, 2002), p. 363; G. H.

The Baroque era in music, between the early music of the Medieval and Renaissance periods and the development of fully fledged and formalised orchestral classical music in the second half of the eighteenth century, was characterised by more elaborate musical ornamentation, changes in musical notation, new instrumental playing techniques and the rise of new genres such as opera. Although the term Baroque is conventionally used for European music from about 1600, its full effects were not felt in Britain until after 1660, delayed by native trends and developments in music, religious and cultural differences from many European countries and the disruption to court music caused by the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and Interregnum.<ref name="Wainright2006">J.

The Baroque era in British music can be seen as one of an interaction of national and international trends, sometimes absorbing continental fashions and practices and sometimes attempting, as in the creation of ballad opera, to produce an indigenous tradition.<ref name=Lubbock1962>M. Lubbock, The Complete Book of Light Opera (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962) pp. 467-8.</ref> However, arguably the most significant British composer of the era, George Frideric Handel, was a naturalised German, who helped integrate British and continental music and define the future of the classical music of the United Kingdom that would be officially formed in 1801.<ref>E.

Musical composition, performance and training in the United Kingdom inherited European classical traditions of the eighteenth century (above all, in Britain, from the example of Handel) and saw a great expansion during the nineteenth century.<ref>D.

==Timeline of British classical music, and its preceding forms==
==Folk music==
Each of the four countries of the United Kingdom has its own diverse and distinctive folk music forms. Folk music flourished until the era of industrialisation when it began to be replaced by new forms of popular music, including music hall and brass bands. Realisation of this led to three roots revival, one in the late-19th century, one in the mid-20th century and one at the start of the 21st century which keeps folk music as an important sub-culture within society.<ref name="Boyes1993">G. Boyes, The Imagined Village: Culture, Ideology, and the English Folk Revival (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1993), .</ref>
===English folk music===
England has a long and diverse history of folk music dating back at least to the medieval period and including many forms of music, song and dance. Through three periods of revival from the late nineteenth century much of the tradition has been preserved and continues to be practiced.<ref name="Boyes1993"/> It led to the creation of a number of fusions with other forms of music that produced subgenres such as British folk rock, folk punk and folk metal and continues to thrive nationally and in regional scenes, particularly in areas such as Northumbria and Cornwall.<ref name="Sweers2005">B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), .</ref>
=== Northern Irish music ===
Ireland, including Northern Ireland, has vibrant folk traditions. The popularity of traditional instruments such as fiddles has remained throughout the centuries even as analogues in Great Britain died out. Perhaps the most famous modern musician from Northern Ireland influenced by folk tradition is Van Morrison.
=== Scottish folk music ===
Scottish folk music includes many kinds of songs, including ballads and laments, sung by a single singer with accompaniment by bagpipes, fiddles or harps. Traditional dances include waltzes, reels, strathspeys and jigs. Alongside the other areas of the United Kingdom, Scotland underwent a roots revival in the 1960s. Cathy-Ann McPhee and Jeannie Robertson were the heroes of this revival, which inspired some revolutions in band formats by groups like The Clutha, The Whistlebinkies, The Boys of the Lough and the Incredible String Band.
=== Welsh folk music ===
Wales is a Celtic country that features folk music played at twmpathau (communal dances) and gwyl werin (music festivals). Welsh music also includes male voice choirs and songs accompanied by a harp. Having long been subordinate to English culture, Welsh musicians in the late 20th century had to reconstruct traditional music when a roots revival began. This revival began in the late 1970s and achieved some mainstream success in the UK in the 1980s with performers like Robin Huw Bowen, Moniars and Gwerinos.
== Early British popular music ==
In the sense of commercial music enjoyed by the people, British popular music can be seen to originate in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries with the arrival of the broadside ballad, which were sold cheaply and in great numbers until the nineteenth century.<ref>B. Capp, ‘Popular literature’, in B. Reay, ed., Popular Culture in Seventeenth-Century England (Routledge, 1985), p. 199.</ref> Further technological, economic and social changes led to new forms of music in the 20th century, including the brass band, which produced a popular and communal form of classical music.<ref name=Herbert2000>T. Herbert, The British Brass Band: a Musical and Social History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 4-5.</ref> Similarly, the music hall sprang up to cater for the entertainment of new urban societies, adapting existing forms of music to produce popular songs and acts.<ref name=Howard>Diana Howard London Theatres and Music Halls 1850-1950 (1970).</ref> In the 1930s, the influence of American Jazz led to the creation of British dance bands, who provided a social and popular music that began to dominate social occasions and the radio airwaves.<ref>C. Parsonage, The evolution of jazz in Britain, 1880-1935 (Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2005), pp. 197-200.</ref>
== Modern British popular music ==
=== Pioneering and developments ===
Britain has influenced popular music disproportionately to its size, due to its linguistic and cultural links with many countries, particularly the United States and many of its former colonies like Australia, South Africa, and Canada, and its capacity for invention, innovation and fusion, which has led to the development of, or participation in, many of the major trends in popular music.<ref>P. Childs, M. Storry, Encyclopedia of contemporary British culture (London: Taylor & Francis, 1999), p. 412.</ref> Forms of popular music, including folk music, jazz, rapping/hip hop, pop and rock music, have particularly flourished in Britain since the twentieth century.
In the early-20th century, influences from the United States became most dominant in popular music, with young performers producing their own versions of American music, including rock n' roll from the late 1950s and developing a parallel music scene. During the early 1960s, the British Invasion, led by The Beatles, helped to secure British performers a major place in development of pop and rock music. According to the website of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, the term "pop music" "originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced".<ref name="Grove2"/> The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop's "earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience . since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical music, usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, ABBA a Swedish act, etc."<ref name="The Oxford Dictionary of Music"/> Since then, rock music and popular music contributed to a British-American collaboration, with trans-Atlantic genres being exchanged and exported to one another, where they tended to be adapted and turned into new movements. 
Britain's most significant contribution to popular music during the 20th century was towards the expansion of rock music. Progressive rock was predicated on the "progressive" pop groups from the 1960s who combined rock and roll with various other music styles such as Indian ragas, oriental melodies and Gregorian chants, like the Beatles and the Yardbirds. According to AllMusic, the emergence of psychedelic rock in the mid-1960s resulted from British bands who made up the British Invasion of the US market.<ref name="allmusic2"/> Many of the top British bands during the 1960s experienced art school during their youth, and espoused an approach based on art and originality—which came to create art rock. As a diverging act to the popular pop rock of the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones pioneered the gritty, heavier-driven sound that came to define hard rock.<ref name="allmusic.com"/> Heavy metal was created by British musicians, including acts like Black Sabbath and Deep Purple.<ref name="Larson2004a2"/> Glam rock, which was developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s, was performed by musicians who wore outrageous costumes, makeup, and hairstyles, particularly platform shoes and glitter—this is widely associated with David Bowie.<ref name="Encarta2"/> Rolling Stone argued that the Sex Pistols, a prominent punk rock band, came to spark and personify one of the few truly critical moments in pop culture—the rise of punk during the 1970s.<ref name="RSE"></ref> Music historian Vernon Joynson claimed that new wave emerged in the UK in late 1976, when many bands began disassociating themselves from punk.<ref name="Joynson 2001 11"></ref> Gothic rock emerged from post-punk in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s by bands including Siouxsie and the Banshees,<ref name="NME2"></ref> Joy Division,<ref name="Pitchfork2"></ref><ref name="NME2" /><ref></ref> Bauhaus,<ref name="Pitchfork2" /> and the Cure.<ref name="NME2" /> Other subgenres of rock invented by or radically changed by British acts include blues rock, ska, British folk rock, folk punk, shoegaze, and Britpop.
=== Post-rock era ===
In addition to advancing the scope of rock music, British acts developed avant-funk and neo soul and created acid jazz. Whilst disco is an American form of music, British pop group Bee Gees were the most prominent performers of the disco music era in the mid-to-late 1970s, and came be to known as the "Kings of Disco" by media outlets.<ref></ref> The Second British Invasion, which derived from the British Invasion of the US in the 1960s, consisted of music acts from the United Kingdom that became popular in the United States during the early-to-mid 1980s primarily due to the cable music channel MTV.<ref name="Guardian"></ref> These synthpop and new wave associated acts often featured on the American pop charts, and according to Rolling Stone, brought "revolution in sound and style". New Pop became an umbrella term used by the music industry to describe young, mostly British, androgynous, and technologically oriented artists such as Culture Club and Eurythmics.<ref name="Reynolds2">Simon Reynolds, Rip It Up and Start Again Postpunk 1978–1984, pp. 340, 342–3.</ref> Additionally, Boy George of Culture Club was a leading figure in the new romantic movement which became a major part in the Second British Invasion of the US. British rock bands, most notably Def Leppard and Iron Maiden,<ref></ref> also became part of the renewed popularity of British music.<ref name="Scripps-Howard"></ref> Newsweek magazine ran an issue which featured Scottish singer Annie Lennox of Eurythmics and Boy George on the cover of its issue with the caption Britain Rocks America&nbsp;– Again, while Rolling Stone would release an "England Swings: Great Britain invades America's music and style. Again." issue in November 1983.<ref name="Reynolds2"/> Pop-star George Michael was one of the most popular acts of the MTV Generation, cementing this position with his hugely successful Faith album in 1987.<ref></ref>
During most of the 1990s, Cool Britannia—a period of increased pride in the culture of the United Kingdom, inspired by the 1960s Swinging Sixties—was coined due to the success of the girl band Spice Girls and Britpop acts Blur and Oasis, which led to a renewed feeling of optimism in the United Kingdom following the pessimistic tone of the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name="guardian1"></ref> The electronic subgenres trip hop, dubstep, and industrial originated in Britain during the 1990s.<ref name="Henderson22"/><ref name=":1"/><ref name=":2"/> During the 21st century, blue-eyed soul came to be dominated by British singers, including Amy Winehouse, Duffy and most notably Adele, who has broken several sales and chart records.<ref>D, while her sophomore album '21' sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, bringing soul music to mainstream American audiences. Jeffries, urltoken "Adele: biography", Allmusic, retrieved 20 July 2012.</ref> Adele has won more Grammy Awards than any other woman who was born outside the US.<ref></ref> This wave of popular British soul singers led to a consideration of whether a third British Invasion was taking place—this time a soul invasion—(in contrast to the 1960s rock and pop, and 1980s Second British Invasion). English singer Ed Sheeran was the foremost folk-orientated artist of the 2010s; the Official Charts Company named him artist of the decade, with the most combined success in the UK album and singles charts in the 2010s.<ref name="Decade"></ref> Globally, Spotify named Sheeran the second most streamed artist of the decade.<ref name="Decade" /> London formed English-Irish pop boy band One Direction were one of the biggest Teen Idols of the 2010s. Little Mix, a pop Girl group and the winner of the eight series of the british version of The X Factor, established themselves as the UK's biggest girl group and one of the Best-selling girl groups in the world. <ref></ref> <ref></ref>
=== Immigration musical impact ===
Highlighting the influence of immigrants in the United Kingdom during the 21st century, British African-Caribbean people created drum and bass, grime, Afrobeats, and afroswing. Grime has been described as the "most significant musical development within the UK for decades."<ref></ref> In addition, British Asians have popularised Bhangra within the South Asian diaspora.

Throughout its history, the United Kingdom has been a major producer and source of musical creation, drawing its early artistic basis from church music and the ancient and traditional folk music and instrumentation of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. Each of the four countries of the United Kingdom has its own diverse and distinctive folk music forms, which flourished until the era of industrialisation when it began to be replaced by new forms of popular music, including music hall and brass bands. Many British musicians have influenced modern music on a global scale, and the United Kingdom has one of the world's largest music industry. Global music widely developed by British acts include pop, rock; as well as subgenres of the genre; avant-funk, new wave, acid jazz, neo soul, trip hop, dubstep and industrial.<ref name="Henderson22"/><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />
In the 20th century, influences from the music of the United States, including blues and rock and roll, became entrenched in the United Kingdom. The "British Invasion"—spearheaded by Liverpool band the Beatles, often regarded as the Cultural impact of the Beatles<ref></ref>—saw British rock bands become highly influential around the world in the 1960s and 1970s.
