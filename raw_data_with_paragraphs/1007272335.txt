University of the Philippines Diliman

== Culture, sports and traditions ==
The Diliman community is sometimes referred to as the Diliman Republic and a "microcosm of the Philippines". It is the only university in Metro Manila that has its own jeepney transportation system due to its sheer size. The university also has a congressional franchise to operate two radio stations (AM and FM) as well as a television station. Currently, the university only operates DZUP 1602, a community AM radio station. The campus encompasses a number of residential areas and many students claim a sense of solidarity with the residents of these immediate communities. On the other hand, The Philippine Collegian is the official student publication of the university, and one of only three tertiary-level campus publications in the Philippines released weekly.
U.P. Diliman represents the U.P. System in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) and participates in all events. The Fighting Maroons have perennially placed in the top three in the overall points race of the UAAP. One of the most popular athletic teams in the program is the UP Pep Squad, a heavyweight in the annual UAAP Cheerdance Competition.
Two of the most-awaited events inside the campus are the Lantern Parade, held in the last week before the Christmas break, and the U.P. Fair, held every February. During the Lantern Parade, the individual colleges as well as groups within U.P.D. create Christmas lanterns and floats and parade around the Academic Oval, culminating in a lengthy program held in front of the Amphitheater capped off by a massive fireworks display. In recent years the event has become so popular even outside of UP that media outlets and major Manila television networks regularly send crews to broadcast the event live.<ref></ref>
The U.P. Fair, organized by the UP Diliman University Student Council, is a week-long event held at the Sunken Garden that features evening music concerts, booths, and amusement park rides. Typically falling during the third week of February, students and youth even from outside the U.P. System flock to the nightly concerts.
==Centennial Celebration==
On January 8, 2008, the University of the Philippines System, with 7 constituent universities and 12 campuses offering 258 undergraduate and 438 graduate programs, began its centennial celebration at the Diliman campus. The university has produced 7 of 15 presidents, 12 chief justices of the Supreme Court, 34 of 35 national scientists and 36 of 57 national artists, and an estimated 250,000 alumni (15,000 doctors, 8,000 lawyers and 23,000 teachers).<ref></ref> Of the senators serving in the 2010–2013 term, 14 were from UP.<ref name="investvine"></ref>
Fernando Javier, 100, of Baguio, oldest living U.P. alumnus (Civil Engineering from the University of the Philippines Manila, 1933), began the 100-torch relay at the U.P. academic oval in Diliman, Quezon City. The 99th torchbearer was Michael Reuben Dumlao, youngest, a 6th-grader from the University of the Philippines Integrated School in U.P. Diliman. Then U.P. president Emerlinda R. Roman, also its first woman president, ignited the centennial cauldron in front of the U.P. Oblation plaza.<ref></ref>
The cauldron featured three pillars representing the University's core values of Excellence, Leadership, and Service and 7 flowers representing the constituent universities, to wit, U.P. Manila, U.P. Diliman (together with U.P. Pampanga, its extension campus), U.P. Los Baños, U.P. Baguio, U.P. Visayas, U.P. Mindanao, and U.P. Open University.<ref> urltoken www.mb.com.ph, UP alumni light the perpetual flame at centennial rites</ref>
The centennial celebration came with a massive fund-raising campaign for the U.P. System, and generous donations from alumni came pouring in. One of the largest was the GT-Toyota Asian Cultural (ACC) Center, a gleaming 100-million-peso, one-hectare complex envisioned to be a major hub of campus activity as well as the main site of the Asian Center's different collaborations.<ref></ref>

As part of the University of the Philippines System, U.P.
