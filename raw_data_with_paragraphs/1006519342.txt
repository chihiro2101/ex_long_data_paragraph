David Hockney

==David Hockney Foundation==
The David Hockney Foundation—both the UK registered charity 1127262 and the US 501(c)(3) private operating foundation—was created by the artist in 2008. In 2012, Hockney, worth an estimated $55.2&nbsp;million (approx. £36.1&nbsp;m), transferred paintings valued at $124.2&nbsp;million (approx. £81.5&nbsp;m) to the David Hockney Foundation, and gave an additional $1.2&nbsp;million (approx. £0.79&nbsp;m) in cash to help fund the foundation's operations.<ref></ref>
The foundation's mission is to advance appreciation and understanding of visual art and culture through the exhibition, preservation, and publication of David Hockney's work. Richard Benefield, who organized David Hockney: A Bigger Exhibition in 2013–2014 at the de Young Museum in San Francisco, became the first executive director in January 2017.<ref></ref>
The foundation owns over 8,000 works - paintings, drawings, watercolours, complete editioned prints, stage design, multi-camera movies, and other media. They also hold 203 sketchbooks and Hockney's personal photo albums from 1961 to 1990. The foundation manages various loans to museums and exhibitions around the world, including Happy Birthday, Mr. Hockney! at the Getty celebrating his 80th birthday, and the retrospective exhibitions of 2017–2018 at the Metropolitan Museum, Centre Georges Pompidou, and Tate Britain.
