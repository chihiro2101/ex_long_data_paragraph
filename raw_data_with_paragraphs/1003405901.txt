==Economy==
Due to its exceptionally fertile soil, market gardening is carried out on a commercial scale in the surrounding area, known as the Vale of Evesham, which is known for its production of fruit and vegetables. A distinctive form of leasehold tenure, known as the Evesham Custom, still regulates market garden tenancies in the area. A decline in the second half of the 20th century resulted in the closing of Evesham's Smithfield Market while the Central Market stopped being used for produce auctions. Between 1983 and 2008, Evesham was home to computer manufacturer Evesham Micros, later renamed Evesham Technology. It was a significant contributor to the United Kingdom's domestic computer and digital television market. At its peak, the company employed up to 300 people with a chain of 19 retail stores in towns and cities throughout the UK. It went into liquidation in 2008.<ref>
</ref>
Retail and food outlets are provided for in the traditional high street and the Riverside Shopping Centre, and Four Pools Lane Retail Park.<ref></ref> The Valley (formerly Evesham Country Park), is a large retail and leisure park located out of town with a diversity of stores, restaurants and cafés.
==Transport==
In 1728 the London to Worcester road through Evesham was turnpiked as was the Evesham to Alcester road in 1778 improving communications in the area.<ref></ref> Evesham is at the junction of the A46 and A44 trunk roads &ndash; the £7 million, A46 single-carriageway bypass to the east of the town opened in July 1987 as the A435.<ref>
</ref>
The River Avon is a navigable waterway linking the River Severn at Tewkesbury to the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal at Stratford-upon-Avon. The river between the town and Stratford is managed by the Upper Avon Navigation Trust, and below by the Lower Avon Navigation Trust, reflecting the administration of the river since the Restoration, when the lower Avon required only modest repairs, but significant investment was required above the town.<ref>J. Davies, Shakespeare's Avon: the history of a navigation (Oakwood Press, 1996), 25-9.</ref> The ancient Hampton Ferry links the town to Hampton.
In 1845 an Act of parliament was passed for the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway<ref name =tde/> and Evesham railway station opened between Honeybourne and Pershore. The station is on the Cotswold Line from Oxford to Worcester, Great Malvern and Hereford. There are trains every 45&ndash;55 minutes to London Paddington that take approximately 1 hour 45 minutes and trains to Birmingham take around 90 minutes (changing at Worcester).
The nearest major airport is Birmingham International about 40 minutes away by trunk roads and the M42 motorway. Gloucestershire Airport at Staverton is a general aviation airport used for pilot training, private charter and scheduled flights to Jersey and the Isle of Man.
Work began in September 2013 to replace the Abbey Bridge and was completed in March 2014.<ref></ref>

==Culture==
Evesham had a distinctive dialect, which locals called "Asum Grammar",<ref name=Badsey>
</ref> or "Asum Grammer". The editor of the local newspaper quoted extracts from a fictitious dictionary of the language.<ref name=AsumGrammer></ref> In 1891, a glossary was published of words and phrases in South-East Worcestershire, comprising the district around Evesham and Pershore. This publication itself built on that of an 1882 author identified only as "Mrs Chamberlain".<ref name=Chope1891></ref> Prior to the 1882 book, little attention had been paid to the dialect of "the old Worcestershire folks", despite it being "interesting and peculiar". A decline in the dialect was already being noted, attributed at that time to standardisation of English schooling,<ref name=MrsChamberlain1882></ref> something noted also by later writers on English dialects.<ref name=Wakelin2008></ref> The dialect continues to decline, but is stronger in older generations.<ref name=Badsey/> More recent factors in its decline are attributed to changes in the market gardening scene, where the dialect was to be heard at its fullest, and the impact of television.<ref name=AsumGrammer/> In the local dialect, "Asum" is a contraction of the town's name.<ref name=Badsey/><ref name=ETCLifeInEvesham>
</ref> Asum was an ale produced by the now defunct Evesham Brewery. "Eve-shum" is the more common phonetic pronunciation, but "Eve-uh-shum" is not uncommon.<ref name=ETCLifeInEvesham/>

Evesham is situated on a horseshoe-shaped peninsula almost completely surrounded by water in a meander of the River Avon between Stratford-upon-Avon and Tewkesbury. The modern town encompasses Bengeworth and Hampton, Worcestershire, which were originally independent villages on the opposite bank of the river. Evesham is linked to Bengeworth by Workman Bridge and Hampton by Abbey Bridge, or New Bridge the first completely structural concrete bridge in the country.<ref>
</ref>
The Cotswold hills stretch from the east to the south-west, while to the west the area is bounded by the Malvern Hills. To the north the land is flat with gentle undulations.<ref name=New1904Ch2p10>New, Edmund H (1904), chapter 2 (p.10 in Google books version)</ref> The Avon, a tributary of the River Severn, is navigable but mainly used by leisure traffic and there is a marina providing moorings.
The River Avon at Evesham has always been susceptible to heavy flooding which is well documented from the 13th century. In May 1924 floods at Evesham ranked 5th in the annual flood list 1848 to 1935.<ref name=Erwood></ref> In May 1998, Evesham was one of the towns worst hit by record flooding along the River Avon. The river rose in just a few hours, sinking tethered narrowboats, flooding areas of Bengeworth, and threatening the 19th-century Workman Bridge as static homes from a riverside caravan site broke up and became wedged in its arches. In July 2007 Evesham had its heaviest rainfall for 200 years, reaching more than 320% the average in some areas. In the Severn catchment, it caused some of the heaviest floods recorded, and in Evesham the flooding was the worst in its recorded history.<ref>
