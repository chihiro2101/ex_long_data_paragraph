1933 in literature

==Events==
*February – Having joined the Japanese Communist Party, the Chinese novelist Hu Feng is arrested and "badly beaten" in Tokyo for his protests against imperialism. Returning to the Republic of China as a popular hero, he is nevertheless prevented from joining the Communist Party of China by the rejection of him by a rival, Zhou Yang.<ref></ref>
*February 17 – The magazine Newsweek is published for the first time in New York.
*March 8 – Première of Federico García Lorca's play Blood Wedding (Bodas de Sangre) is held at the Teatro Beatriz in Madrid.
*April 23 – Millosh Gjergj Nikolla is appointed schoolteacher among the Serbs of Vraka, Kingdom of Albania. The next two years bring his creative period as a short story writer, describing his sense of despair at being isolated in a backward region.<ref></ref>
*May – Nazi book burnings take place in Germany by the German Student Union, principally of works by Jewish intellectuals, leading to an Exilliteratur. Although his novels are spared (unlike those of his brother Heinrich Mann), Thomas Mann settles in Switzerland. Lion Feuchtwanger, on a lecture tour of the United States in January, has decided not to return to Germany; Bertolt Brecht has moved to Prague in February; and Alfred Döblin to Switzerland in March.
*May 16–17 – In the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin orders the NKVD to "preserve but isolate" Osip Mandelstam, after having been informed of the "Stalin Epigram"; Mandelstam is then arrested. A protest by literary figures, including Anna Akhmatova and Boris Pasternak, prompts Stalin to declare that he might "review the case" (he never will). His admiration for Pasternak as a poetic genius is strengthened when the latter asks for a private meeting to discuss "life and death" — although he never grants it, he instructs the NKVD to "leave that cloud-dweller Pasternak alone".<ref></ref>

*October (approximate) – The name Inklings, previously used by a disbanded undergraduate group, is taken by an informal literary discussion group of University of Oxford academics, including C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien.<ref></ref>
*October 8 – The General Union of Roma in Romania is set up by writer Gheorghe A. Lăzăreanu-Lăzurică, with Grigoraș Dinicu as honorary president; by 1934, it publishes the Romani language newspaper O Ròm, and books of Romani mythology, edited by Constantin S. Nicolăescu-Plopșor.<ref></ref> 
*December
**Codex Sinaiticus sold by the Soviet Union to the British Library through the agency of Maggs Bros Ltd at a price of £100,000, the highest ever paid for a book at this time.
**Raymond Chandler's first short story, the detective fiction "Blackmailers Don't Shoot", is published in the magazine Black Mask in the United States.
*December 6 – In United States v. One Book Called Ulysses, U.S. District Judge John M. Woolsey rules that James Joyce's novel Ulysses is not as a whole Pornography and therefore cannot not be obscene.<ref>Case citation .</ref>
