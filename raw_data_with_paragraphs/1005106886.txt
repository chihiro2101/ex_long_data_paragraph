Anna Anderson

==Dalldorf asylum (1920–1922)==
On 27 February 1920,<ref>Berlin Police report, quoted by Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, p. 89</ref> a young woman attempted to commit suicide in Berlin by jumping off the Bendlerblock bridge into the Landwehrkanal. She was rescued by a police sergeant and was admitted to the Elisabeth Hospital on Lützowplatz. As she was without papers and refused to identify herself, she was admitted as Fräulein Unbekannt ("Miss Unknown") to a mental hospital in Dalldorf (now Wittenau, in Reinickendorf), where she remained for the next two years.<ref name=km93>Klier and Mingay, p. 93; Berlin Police report, quoted by Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, p. 89</ref> The unknown patient had scars on her head and body<ref>King and Wilson, pp. 82–84; Massie, p. 163</ref> and spoke German with an accent described as "Russian" by medical staff.<ref>Nurse Erna Buchholz and Dr Bonhoeffer quoted by Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, pp. 95–96</ref>
In early 1922, Clara Peuthert, a fellow psychiatric patient, claimed that the unknown woman was Grand Duchess Tatiana of Russia, one of the four daughters of Tsar Nicholas II.<ref>I, Anastasia, p. 91; Klier and Mingay, p. 94; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 14</ref> On her release, Peuthert told White émigré Captain Nicholas von Schwabe that she had seen Tatiana at Dalldorf.<ref>King and Wilson, p. 91; Klier and Mingay, p. 94, Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 16–17</ref> Schwabe visited the asylum and accepted the woman as Tatiana.<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, p. 21; Welch, p. 103</ref> Schwabe persuaded other émigrés to visit the unknown woman, including Zinaida Tolstoy, a friend of Tsarina Alexandra. Eventually Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden, a former lady-in-waiting to the Tsarina, visited the asylum with Tolstoy. On seeing the woman, Buxhoeveden declared "She's too short for Tatiana,"<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 95; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 25; Massie, p. 163</ref> and left convinced the woman was not a Russian grand duchess.<ref>I, Anastasia, p. 93; Hall, p. 340; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 25</ref> A few days later, the unknown woman noted, "I did not say I was Tatiana."<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 95; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 26</ref>
A nurse at Dalldorf, Thea Malinovsky, claimed years after the patient's release from the asylum that the woman had told her she was another daughter of the Tsar, Anastasia, in the autumn of 1921.<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, p. 12</ref> However, the patient herself could not recall the incident.<ref>I, Anastasia, p. 91</ref> Her biographers either ignore Malinovsky's claim,<ref>Klier and Mingay, pp. 93–94, just describes Peuthert's claim.</ref> or weave it into their narrative.<ref>King and Wilson, pp. 88–89; Massie, p. 163</ref>
==Germany and Switzerland (1922–1927)==
By May 1922, the woman was believed by Peuthert, Schwabe, and Tolstoy to be Anastasia, although Buxhoeveden said there was no resemblance.<ref>I, Anastasia, p. 93; Klier and Mingay, p. 95</ref> Nevertheless, the woman was taken out of the asylum and given a room in the Berlin home of Baron Arthur von Kleist, a Russian émigré who had been a police chief in Russian Poland before the fall of the Tsar. The Berlin policeman who handled the case, Detective Inspector Franz Grünberg, thought that Kleist "may have had ulterior motives, as was hinted at in émigré circles: if the old conditions should ever be restored in Russia, he hoped for great advancement from having looked after the young woman."<ref>Letter from Grünberg to his superior, Councillor Goehrke, quoted by Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, p. 92</ref>
She began calling herself Anna Tschaikovsky,<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 96; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 53; Berlin police records, quoted by Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, p. 112</ref> choosing "Anna" as a short form of "Anastasia",<ref>I, Anastasia, p. 98; Klier and Mingay, p. 96</ref> although Peuthert "described her everywhere as Anastasia".<ref>Grünberg's notes, quoted by Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, p. 112</ref> Tschaikovsky stayed in the houses of acquaintances, including Kleist, Peuthert, a poor working-class family called Bachmann, and at Inspector Grünberg's estate at Funkenmühle, near Zossen.<ref>I, Anastasia, pp. 100–112; Klier and Mingay, pp. 97–98; Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 29–63</ref> At Funkenmühle, Grünberg arranged for the Tsarina's sister, Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine, to meet Tschaikovsky, but Irene did not recognize her.<ref>Klier and Mingay, pp. 97–98; Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 51–52; Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, pp. 103, 106–107; Welch, p. 108</ref> Grünberg also arranged a visit from Crown Princess Cecilie of Prussia, but Tschaikovsky refused to speak to her, and Cecilie was left perplexed by the encounter.<ref>I, Anastasia, p. 115; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 64; Klier and Mingay, p. 98; Massie, p. 168</ref> Later, in the 1950s, Cecilie signed a declaration that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia,<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, p. 343; Massie, p. 168; Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, p. 116</ref> but Cecilie's family disputed her statement and implied that she was suffering from dementia.<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, p. 343</ref>
By 1925, Tschaikovsky had developed a tuberculous infection of her arm, and she was placed in a succession of hospitals for treatment. Sick and near death, she suffered significant loss of weight.<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 84–85; Massie, p. 172; Welch, p. 110</ref> She was visited by the Tsarina's groom of the chamber Alexei Volkov; Anastasia's tutor Pierre Gilliard; his wife, Shura, who had been Anastasia's nursemaid; and the Tsar's sister, Grand Duchess Olga. Although they expressed sympathy, if only for Tschaikovsky's illness, and made no immediate public declarations, eventually they all denied she was Anastasia.<ref>Klier and Mingay, pp. 99–103; Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 99–124; Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, pp. 135–169</ref> In March 1926, she convalesced in Lugano with Harriet von Rathlef at the expense of Grand Duchess Anastasia's great-uncle, Prince Valdemar of Denmark. Valdemar was willing to offer Tschaikovsky material assistance, through the Danish ambassador to Germany, Herluf Zahle, while her identity was investigated.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 91; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 102</ref> To allow her to travel, the Berlin Aliens Office issued her with a temporary certificate of identity as "Anastasia Tschaikovsky", with Grand Duchess Anastasia's personal details.<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, p. 130</ref> After a quarrel with Rathlef, Tschaikovsky was moved to the Stillachhaus Sanatorium at Oberstdorf in the Bavarian Alps in June 1926, and Rathlef returned to Berlin.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 104; Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 130–134; Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, pp. 180–187</ref>
At Oberstdorf, Tschaikovsky was visited by Tatiana Melnik, née Botkin. Melnik was the niece of Serge Botkin, the head of the Russian refugee office in Berlin, and the daughter of the imperial family's personal physician, Dr. Eugene Botkin, who had been murdered by the communists alongside the Tsar's family in 1918. Tatiana Melnik had met Grand Duchess Anastasia as a child and had last spoken to her in February 1917.<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, p. 138</ref> To Melnik, Tschaikovsky looked like Anastasia, even though "the mouth has changed and coarsened noticeably, and because the face is so lean, her nose looks bigger than it was."<ref>Tatiana Melnik's declaration on oath, 1929, quoted (in negligibly different translations) by Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, p. 193; King and Wilson, p. 172 and Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 141–142</ref> In a letter, Melnik wrote: "Her attitude is childlike, and altogether she cannot be reckoned with as a responsible adult, but must be led and directed like a child. She has not only forgotten languages, but has in general lost the power of accurate narration&nbsp;. even the simplest stories she tells incoherently and incorrectly; they are really only words strung together in impossibly ungrammatical German&nbsp;. Her defect is obviously in her memory and eyesight."<ref>Quoted (in two negligibly different translations) by Massie in p. 169 and Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, p. 195</ref> Melnik declared that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia, and supposed that any inability on her part to remember events and her refusal to speak Russian was caused by her impaired physical and psychological state.<ref>Massie, p. 170; Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, pp. 197–198</ref> Either inadvertently through a sincere desire to "aid the patient's weak memory"<ref>Pierre Gilliard (1929) La Fausse Anastasie quoted in Krug von Nidda, p. 198</ref> or as part of a deliberate charade,<ref>Godl (1998)</ref> Melnik coached Tschaikovsky with details of life in the imperial family.
==Castle Seeon (1927)==
In 1927, under pressure from his family, Valdemar decided against providing Tschaikovsky with any further financial support, and the funds from Denmark were cut off.<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 151–153; Massie, p. 181</ref> Duke of Leuchtenberg, a distant relative of the Tsar, gave her a home at Seeon Abbey.<ref>Klier and Mingay, pp. 105–106; Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 151–153; Massie, p. 181</ref> The Tsarina's brother, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, hired a private detective, Martin Knopf, to investigate the claims that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia.<ref>Anderson's supporters claimed that Ernest Louis's hostility towards Anderson arose from her allegation that they had last met when he had visited Russia in 1916. Anderson claimed that in the midst of a war between Russia and Germany, Ernest Louis had visited Russia to negotiate a separate peace. Ernest Louis denied the allegation, which if true would have been tantamount to treason. There was no conclusive proof either way. (See: Klier and Mingay, pp. 100–101; Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 93–95; Massie, pp. 177–178; Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, pp. 127–129)</ref>
During her stay at Castle Seeon, Knopf reported that Tschaikovsky was actually a Polish factory worker called Franziska Schanzkowska.<ref>King and Wilson, pp. 306–314; Klier and Mingay, p. 105; Massie, pp. 178–179</ref> Schanzkowska had worked in a munitions factory during World War I when, shortly after her fiancé had been killed at the front, a grenade fell out of her hand and exploded. She had been injured in the head, and a foreman was killed in front of her.<ref>King and Wilson, pp. 282–283; Klier and Mingay, p. 224; Massie, p. 249</ref> She became apathetic and depressed, was declared insane on 19 September 1916,<ref>King and Wilson, p. 283; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 167</ref> and spent time in two lunatic asylums.<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, p. 415, note 93</ref> In early 1920, she was reported missing from her Berlin lodgings, and since then had not been seen or heard from by her family.<ref>Klier and Mingay, pp. 105, 224; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 166; Massie, pp. 178–179, 250</ref> In May 1927, Franziska's brother Felix Schanzkowski was introduced to Tschaikovsky at a local inn in Wasserburg near Castle Seeon. Leuchtenberg's son, Dmitri, was completely certain that Tschaikovsky was an impostor and that she was recognized by Felix as his sister,<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 106; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 415, note 80</ref> but Leuchtenberg's daughter, Natalie, remained convinced of Tschaikovsky's authenticity.<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, p. 180; Massie, p. 181</ref> Leuchtenberg himself was ambivalent.<ref>King and Wilson, p. 160; Massie, p. 181</ref> According to one account, initially Felix declared that Tschaikovsky was his sister Franziska,<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 106; Report of Dr. Wilhelm Völler, attorney to Harriet von Rathlef, in the Fallows collection, Houghton Library, quoted in Kurth, Anastasia, p. 172; Massie, p. 180</ref> but the affidavit he signed spoke only of a "strong resemblance", highlighted physical differences, and said she did not recognize him.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 106; Affidavit of Felix Schanzkowski, Fallows paper, Houghton Library, quoted in Kurth, Anastasia, p. 174</ref> Years later, Felix's family said that he knew Tschaikovsky was his sister, but he had chosen to leave her to her new life, which was far more comfortable than any alternative.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 224</ref>
Visitors to Seeon included Prince Felix Yusupov, husband of Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia, who wrote, "I claim categorically that she is not Anastasia Nicolaievna, but just an adventuress, a sick hysteric and a frightful playactress. that you would recoil in horror at the thought that this frightful creature could be a daughter of our Tsar."<ref>Letter from Prince Felix Yusupov to Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia, 19 September 1927, quoted in Kurth, Anastasia, p. 186</ref> Other visitors, however, such as Felix Dassel, an officer whom Anastasia had visited in hospital during 1916, and Gleb Botkin, who had known Anastasia as a child and was Tatiana Melnik's brother, were convinced that Tschaikovsky was genuine.<ref>Klier and Mingay, pp. 89, 135; Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 193, 201</ref>
==United States (1928–1931)==
By 1928, Tschaikovsky's claim had received interest and attention in the United States, where Gleb Botkin had published articles in support of her cause.<ref>Godl (1998); Klier and Mingay, p.108; Massie, p. 182</ref> Botkin's publicity caught the attention of a distant cousin of Anastasia's, Xenia Leeds, a former Russian princess who had married a wealthy American industrialist.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 108; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 202; Massie, p. 182</ref> Botkin and Leeds arranged for Tschaikovsky to travel to the United States on board the liner at Leeds's expense.<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 202–204</ref> On the journey from Seeon to the States, Tschaikovsky stopped at Paris, where she met Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia, the Tsar's cousin, who believed her to be Anastasia.<ref>King and Wilson, p. 208; Klier and Mingay, p. 109; Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 204–206</ref> For six months Tschaikovsky lived at the estate of the Leeds family in Oyster Bay, New York.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 109; Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 214–219; Massie, pp. 175–176, 181</ref>
As the tenth anniversary of the Tsar's execution approached in July 1928, Botkin retained a lawyer, Edward Fallows, to oversee legal moves to obtain any of the Tsar's estate outside of the Soviet Union. As the death of the Tsar had never been proved, the estate could only be released to relatives ten years after the supposed date of his death.<ref>Clarke, p. 187; Klier and Mingay, p. 110; Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 220–221; Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, p. 242</ref> Fallows set up a company, called the Grandanor Corporation (an acronym of Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia), which sought to raise funds by selling shares in any prospective estate.<ref>Clarke, p. 185; Klier and Mingay, pp. 110, 112–113; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 233; Massie, p. 184</ref> Tschaikovsky claimed that the Tsar had deposited money abroad, which fed unsubstantiated rumors of a large Romanov fortune in England.<ref>Clarke, pp. 188–190; Klier and Mingay, p. 103; Massie, pp. 183–185</ref> The surviving relatives of the Romanovs accused Botkin and Fallows of fortune hunting, and Botkin accused them of trying to defraud "Anastasia" out of her inheritance.<ref>Klier and Mingay, pp. 112, 121, 125; Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 230–231; Massie, p. 183</ref> Except for a relatively small deposit in Germany, distributed to the Tsar's recognized relations, no money was ever found.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 117</ref> After a quarrel, possibly over Tschaikovsky's claim to the estate (but not over her claim to be Anastasia),<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 110; Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 221–222; Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, p. 242</ref> Tschaikovsky moved out of the Leeds' mansion, and the pianist Sergei Rachmaninoff arranged for her to live at the Garden City Hotel in Hempstead, New York, and later in a small cottage. To avoid the press, she was booked in as Mrs. Anderson, the name by which she was subsequently known.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 110; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 227; Massie, p. 181; Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, p. 244</ref> In October 1928, after the death of the Tsar's mother, the Dowager Empress Marie, the 12 nearest relations of the Tsar met at Marie's funeral and signed a declaration that denounced Anderson as an impostor.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 111; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 229; Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, pp. 238–239</ref> The Copenhagen Statement, as it would come to be known, explained: "Our sense of duty compels us to state that the story is only a fairy tale. The memory of our dear departed would be tarnished if we allowed this fantastic story to spread and gain any credence."<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 111; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 229</ref> Gleb Botkin answered with a public letter to Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, which referred to the family as "greedy and unscrupulous" and claimed they were only denouncing Anderson for money.<ref>King and Wilson, pp. 187–188; Klier and Mingay, pp. 111–112; Massie, p. 183</ref>
From early 1929 Anderson lived with Annie Burr Jennings, a wealthy Park Avenue spinster happy to host someone she supposed to be a daughter of the Tsar.<ref>Massie, p. 182</ref> For eighteen months, Anderson was the toast of New York City society.<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, p. 232; Massie, p. 182</ref> Then a pattern of self-destructive behavior began that culminated in her throwing tantrums, killing her pet parakeet,<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 113; Letter from Wilton Lloyd-Smith, Miss Jennings' attorney, to Annie Jennings, 15 July 1930, quoted in Kurth, Anastasia, p. 250</ref> and on one occasion running around naked on the roof.<ref>Letter from Wilton Lloyd-Smith, Miss Jennings' attorney, to Annie Jennings, 22 August 1930, Fallows papers, Houghton Library, quoted in Kurth, Anastasia, p. 251; Massie, p. 182</ref> On 24 July 1930, Judge Peter Schmuck of the New York Supreme Court signed an order committing her to a mental hospital.<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 251–252</ref> Before she could be taken away, Anderson locked herself in her room, and the door was broken in with an axe. She was forcibly taken to the Four Winds Sanatorium in Westchester County, New York, where she remained for slightly over a year.<ref>Massie, p. 182; Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, pp. 250–251</ref> In August 1931, Anderson returned to Germany accompanied by a private nurse in a locked cabin on the liner Deutschland.<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 253–255; Massie, p. 186</ref> Jennings paid for the voyage, the stay at the Westchester sanatorium, and an additional six months' care in the psychiatric wing of a nursing home at Ilten near Hanover.<ref>Massie, p. 186</ref> On arrival at Ilten, Anderson was assessed as sane,<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 125; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 259</ref> but as the room was prepaid, and she had nowhere else to go, she stayed on in a suite in the sanatorium grounds.<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 258–260</ref>
==Germany (1931–1968)==
Anderson's return to Germany generated press interest, and drew more members of the German aristocracy to her cause.<ref name="k&m">Klier and Mingay, p. 127</ref> She again lived itinerantly as a guest of her well-wishers.<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 271–279</ref> In 1932, the British tabloid News of the World published a sensational story accusing her of being a Romanian actress who was perpetrating a fraud.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 127; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 276</ref> Her lawyer, Fallows, filed suit for libel, but the lengthy case continued until the outbreak of World War II, at which time the case was dismissed because Anderson was living in Germany, and German residents could not sue in enemy countries.<ref name="k&m"/> From 1938, lawyers acting for Anderson in Germany contested the distribution of the Tsar's estate to his recognized relations, and they in turn contested her identity.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 115; Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 289–356</ref> The litigation continued intermittently without resolution for decades; Lord Mountbatten footed some of his German relations' legal bills against Anderson.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 128; Massie, p. 189</ref> The protracted proceedings became the longest-running lawsuit in German history.<ref>King and Wilson, p. 236; Klier and Mingay, p. 115</ref>
Anderson had a final meeting with the Schanzkowski family in 1938. Gertrude Schanzkowska was insistent that Anderson was her sister, Franziska,<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 129; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 283; Massie, p. 180</ref> but the Nazi government had arranged the meeting to determine Anderson's identity, and if accepted as Schanzkowska she would be imprisoned.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 129</ref> The Schanzkowski family refused to sign affidavits against her, and no further action was taken.<ref>King and Wilson, p. 316; Klier and Mingay, p. 129</ref> In 1939, World War II began with Germany's attack on the western half of Poland. In 1940, Edward Fallows died virtually destitute after wasting all his own money on trying to obtain the Tsar's non-existent fortune for the Grandanor Corporation.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p.123; Kurth Anastasia, p. 291; Massie, p. 184</ref> Towards the end of the war, Anderson lived at Schloss Winterstein with Louise of Saxe-Meiningen, in what became the Soviet occupation zone. In 1946, Prince Frederick of Saxe-Altenburg helped her across the border to Bad Liebenzell in the French occupation zone.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 129; Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 285–286</ref>
Prince Frederick settled Anderson in a former army barracks in the small village of Unterlengenhardt, on the edge of the Black Forest, where she became a sort of tourist attraction.<ref>Klier and Mingay, pp. 130–131; Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 263–266; Massie, p. 186</ref> Lili Dehn, a friend of Tsarina Alexandra, visited her and acknowledged her as Anastasia,<ref>Klier and Mingay, pp. 153–154; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 288; Massie, p. 187</ref> but when Charles Sydney Gibbes, English tutor to the imperial children, met Anderson he denounced her as a fraud.<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, p. 304; Massie, p. 187</ref> In an affidavit, he swore "She in no way resembles the true Grand Duchess Anastasia that I had known&nbsp;. I am quite satisfied that she is an impostor."<ref>Massie, p. 187</ref> She became a recluse, surrounded by cats, and her house began to decay.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 140; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 334; Massie, p. 191</ref> In May 1968, Anderson was taken to a hospital at Neuenbürg after being discovered semi-conscious in her cottage. In her absence, Prince Frederick cleaned up the property by order of the local board of health.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 140; Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 370–371</ref> Her Irish Wolfhound and 60 cats were put to death.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 140; Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 371–372</ref> Horrified by this, Anderson accepted her long-term supporter Gleb Botkin's offer to move back to the United States.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 142; Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 371–372; Welch p. 253</ref>
==Final years (1968–1984)==
Botkin was living in the college town of Charlottesville, Virginia, and a local friend of his, history professor and genealogist John Eacott "Jack" Manahan, paid for Anderson's journey to the United States.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 142; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 370; Massie, pp. 191–192</ref> She entered the country on a six-month visitor's visa, and shortly before it was due to expire, Anderson married Manahan, who was 20 years her junior, in a civil ceremony on 23 December 1968. Botkin was best man.<ref>King and Wilson, p. 246; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 375</ref> Jack Manahan enjoyed this marriage of convenience,<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, p. 375; Massie, p. 192</ref> and described himself as "Grand Duke-in-Waiting"<ref>Massie, p. 192</ref> or "son-in-law to the Tsar".<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 145</ref> The couple lived in separate bedrooms in a house on University Circle in Charlottesville, and also owned a farm near Scottsville.<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, p. 381</ref> Botkin died in December 1969.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 162; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 376</ref> In February of the following year, 1970, the lawsuits finally came to an end, with neither side able to establish Anderson's identity.<ref>King and Wilson, pp. 236–238; Klier and Mingay, p. 139; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 377</ref>
Manahan and Anderson, now legally called Anastasia Manahan,<ref>King and Wilson, p. 247; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 375</ref> became well known in the Charlottesville area as eccentrics.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 162; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 388; Tucker</ref> Though Jack Manahan was wealthy, they lived in squalor with large numbers of dogs and cats, and piles of garbage.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 162; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 381; Massie, p. 192; Tucker</ref> On 20 August 1979, Anderson was taken to Charlottesville's Martha Jefferson Hospital with an intestinal obstruction. A gangrenous tumor and a length of intestine were removed by Dr. Richard Shrum.<ref>King and Wilson, p. 251; Massie, p. 194</ref>
With both Manahan and Anderson in failing health, in November 1983, Anderson was institutionalized, and an attorney, William Preston, was appointed as her guardian by the local circuit court.<ref>King and Wilson, p. 252; Klier and Mingay, p. 163</ref> A few days later, Manahan "kidnapped"<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 163; Massie, p. 193</ref> Anderson from the hospital, and for three days they drove around Virginia eating out of convenience stores. After a 13-state police alarm, they were found and Anderson was returned to a care facility.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 164; Massie, p. 193</ref> In January she was thought to have had a stroke, and on 12 February 1984, she died of pneumonia.<ref>King and Wilson, p. 253; Klier and Mingay, p. 164</ref> She was cremated the same day, and her ashes were buried in the churchyard at Seeon Abbey on 18 June 1984.<ref>King and Wilson, pp. 253–255; Klier and Mingay, p. 164; Massie, p. 193</ref> Manahan died on 22 March 1990.<ref name=hook/>
==DNA evidence==
In 1991, the bodies of Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of their daughters were exhumed from a mass grave near Yekaterinburg. They were identified on the basis of both skeletal analysis and DNA testing.<ref name=gill/> For example, mitochondrial DNA was used to match maternal relations, and mitochondrial DNA from the female bones matched that of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, whose maternal grandmother Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine was a sister of Alexandra.<ref name=gill>Gill et al.</ref> The bodies of Tsarevich Alexei and the remaining daughter were discovered in 2007. Repeated and independent DNA tests confirmed that the remains were the seven members of the Romanov family, and proved that none of the Tsar's four daughters survived the shooting of the Romanov family.<ref name="coble&rogaev"/><ref name=cnn></ref>
A sample of Anderson's tissue, part of her intestine removed during her operation in 1979, had been stored at Martha Jefferson Hospital, Charlottesville, Virginia. Anderson's mitochondrial DNA was extracted from the sample and compared with that of the Romanovs and their relatives. It did not match that of the Duke of Edinburgh or that of the bones, confirming that Anderson was not related to the Romanovs. However, the sample matched DNA provided by Karl Maucher, a grandson of Franziska Schanzkowska's sister, Gertrude (Schanzkowska) Ellerik, indicating that Karl Maucher and Anna Anderson were maternally related and that Anderson was Schanzkowska.<ref>Godl (1998); Stoneking et al.</ref> Five years after the original testing was done, Dr. Terry Melton of the Department of Anthropology, Pennsylvania State University, stated that the DNA sequence tying Anderson to the Schanzkowski family was "still unique", though the database of DNA patterns at the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory had grown much larger, leading to "increased confidence that Anderson was indeed Franziska Schanzkowska".<ref>Godl (2000a)</ref>
Similarly, several strands of Anderson's hair, found inside an envelope in a book that had belonged to Anderson's husband, Jack Manahan, were also tested. Mitochondrial DNA from the hair matched Anderson's hospital sample and that of Schanzkowska's relative Karl Maucher, but not the Romanov remains or living relatives of the Romanovs.<ref>King and Wilson, pp. 263–266; Massie, p. 246; Stoneking et al.</ref>
==Assessment==
Although communists had murdered the entire imperial Romanov family in July 1918, including 17-year-old Grand Duchess Anastasia, for years afterwards communist disinformation fed rumors that members of the Tsar's family had survived.<ref>King and Wilson, p. 67; Klier and Mingay, pp. 70–71, 82–84; Massie, pp. 144–145</ref> The conflicting rumors about the fate of the family allowed impostors to make Romanov impostors.<ref>King and Wilson, p. 71; Klier and Mingay, pp. 84, 91; Massie, pp. 144–145</ref>
Most of the impostors were dismissed; however, Anna Anderson's claim persisted.<ref>King and Wilson, p. 2; Massie, pp. 144–162</ref> Books and pamphlets supporting her claims included Harriet von Rathlef's book Anastasia, ein Frauenschicksal als Spiegel der Weltkatastrophe (Anastasia, a Woman's Fate as Mirror of the World Catastrophe), which was published in Germany and Switzerland in 1928, though it was serialized by the tabloid newspaper Berliner Nachtausgabe in 1927. This was countered by works such as La Fausse Anastasie (The False Anastasia) by Pierre Gilliard and Constantin Savitch, published by Payot of Paris in 1929.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 103; Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, p. 273</ref> Conflicting testimonies and physical evidence, such as comparisons of facial characteristics, which alternately supported and contradicted Anderson's claim, were used either to bolster or to counter the belief that she was Anastasia.<ref>e.g. King and Wilson, pp. 229–232; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 76</ref> In the absence of any direct documentary proof or solid physical evidence, the question of whether Anderson was Anastasia was for many a matter of personal belief.<ref>King and Wilson, pp. 3–4; Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, p. 83</ref> As Anderson herself said in her own idiomatic English, "You either believe it or you don't believe it. It doesn't matter. In no anyway whatsoever."<ref>Interview on ABC television, broadcast 26 October 1976, quoted in Klier and Mingay, p. 230, and Kurth, Anastasia, p. 383</ref> The German courts were unable to decide her claim one way or another, and eventually, after 40 years of deliberation, ruled that her claim was "neither established nor refuted".<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 139; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 377; Massie, p. 190</ref> Dr. Günter von Berenberg-Gossler, attorney for Anderson's opponents in the later years of the legal case, said that during the German trials "the press were always more interested in reporting her side of the story than the opposing bench's less glamorous perspective; editors often pulled journalists after reporting testimony delivered by her side and ignored the rebuttal, resulting in the public seldom getting a complete picture."<ref name=godl2/>
In 1957, a version of Anderson's story, pieced together by her supporters and interspersed with commentary by Roland Krug von Nidda, was published in Germany under the title Ich, Anastasia, Erzähle (I, Anastasia, an autobiography).<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 143; Kurth, Anastasia, p. 395; Massie, p. 294</ref> The book included the "fantastic tale"<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 96</ref> that Anastasia escaped from Russia on a farm cart with a man called Alexander Tschaikovsky, whom she married and had a child by, before he was shot dead on a Bucharest street, and that the child, Alexei, disappeared into an orphanage. Even Anderson's supporters admitted that the details of the supposed escape "might seem bold inventions even for a dramatist",<ref name=vN81>Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, p. 81</ref> while her detractors considered "this barely credible story as a piece of far-fetched romance".<ref name=vN81/> Other works based on the premise that Anderson was Anastasia, written before the DNA tests, include biographies by Peter Kurth and James Blair Lovell. More recent biographies by John Klier, Robert Massie, and Greg King that describe her as an impostor were written after the DNA tests proved that she was not Anastasia.
Assessments vary as to whether Anderson was a deliberate impostor, delusional, traumatized into adopting a new identity, or someone used by her supporters for their own ends. Pierre Gilliard denounced Anderson as "a cunning psychopath".<ref>Godl (1998); quoted in Kurth, Anastasia, p. 179</ref> The equation of Anderson with members of the imperial family began with Clara Peuthert in the Dalldorf Asylum, rather than with Anderson herself. Anderson appeared to go along with it afterwards.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 94</ref> Writer Michael Thornton thought, "Somewhere along the way she lost and rejected Schanzkowska. She lost that person totally and accepted completely she was this new person. I think it happened by accident and she was swept along on a wave of euphoria."<ref>Quoted by Klier and Mingay, p. 230</ref> Lord Mountbatten, a first cousin of the Romanov children, thought her supporters "simply get rich on the royalties of further books, magazine articles, plays etc."<ref>Letter from Mountbatten to Ian Jacob, 8 September 1958, Broadlands archive, quoted in </ref> Prince Michael Romanov, a grandson of Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, stated the Romanov family always knew Anderson was a fraud, and that the family looked upon her and "the three-ringed circus which danced around her, creating books and movies, as a vulgar insult to the memory of the Imperial Family."<ref name=godl2>Godl (2000b)</ref>
==Fictional portrayals==
Since the 1920s, many fictional works have been inspired by Anderson's claim to be Anastasia. In 1928, the silent film Clothes Make the Woman was based very loosely on her story.<ref>Welch, p. 183</ref> In 1953, Marcelle Maurette wrote a play based on Rathlef's and Gilliard's books called Anastasia,<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 132</ref> which toured Europe and America with Viveca Lindfors in the title role. The play was so successful that in 1956 an English adaptation by Guy Bolton was made into a film, Anastasia.<ref>Kurth, Anastasia, p. 268; Krug von Nidda in I, Anastasia, p. 274</ref> The plot revolves around a group of swindlers who attempt to raise money among Russian émigrés by pretending that Grand Duchess Anastasia is still alive. A suitable amnesiac, "Anna", is groomed by the swindlers to impersonate Anastasia. Anna's origins are unknown and as the play progresses hints are dropped that she could be the real Anastasia, who has lost her memory. The viewer is left to decide whether Anna really is Anastasia.<ref name=times/> Another film was released at the same time, The Story of Anastasia starring Lilli Palmer, which covers much the same ground, but the central character is "perhaps even more lost, mad and pathetic, but she, too, has moments when she is a woman of presence and dignity".<ref name=times></ref>
Playwright Royce Ryton wrote I Am Who I Am about Anna Anderson in 1978. Like the earlier plays, it depicts Anderson as "a person of intrinsic worth victimized by the greed and fears of others" and did not attempt to decide her real identity.<ref></ref>
In 1965, the musical Anya, based on Guy Bolton's play and using the music of Sergei Rachmaninoff, opened on Broadway starring Constance Towers as Anya and Lillian Gish as the Dowager Empress—it was not successful.
Kenneth MacMillan's ballet Anastasia, first performed in 1967, used I, Anastasia, an autobiography as inspiration and "is a dramatic fantasy about Anna Anderson, the woman who believes herself to be Anastasia&nbsp;. Either in memory or imagination, she experiences episodes from Anastasia's past&nbsp;. The structure is a kind of free-wheeling nightmare, held together by the central figure of the heroine, played by Lynn Seymour".<ref></ref> A contemporary reviewer thought Seymour's "tense, tormented portrait of the desperate Anna Anderson is quite extraordinary and really impressive".<ref></ref> Anna Anderson was also used as a narrative device in Youri Vámos' 1992 ballet for Theater Basel, Sleeping Beauty&nbsp;– Last Daughter of the Czar, based on Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty.<ref></ref>
In 1986, a two-part fictionalized made for television mini-series titled Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna appeared (NBC in the U.S.) which starred Amy Irving and won her a Golden Globe nomination. In the words of Hal Erickson, "Irving plays the leading character in a lady-or-the-tiger fashion, so that we never know if she truly swallows her own tale or if she's merely a clever charlatan."<ref></ref>
The central character ("Anya (Anastasia)") of the 1997 animated fantasy Anastasia is portrayed as the actual Grand Duchess Anastasia, even though the film was released after DNA tests proved that Anna Anderson was not Anastasia.<ref></ref> The film is an entirely fictional musical entertainment, and in the words of one reviewer, "historical facts are treated with particular contempt".<ref></ref>

Anna Anderson (16 December 1896&nbsp;– 12 February 1984) was the best known of Romanov impostors who claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia.<ref>Coble et al.; Godl (1998)</ref> Anastasia, the youngest daughter of the last Tsar and Tsarina of Russia, Nicholas II and Alexandra, was Execution of the Romanov family on 17 July 1918 by communist revolutionaries in Yekaterinburg, Russia, but the location of her body was unknown until 2007.<ref name="coble&rogaev">Coble et al.; Rogaev et al.</ref><ref name=cnn/>
In 1920, Anderson was institutionalized in a mental hospital after a suicide attempt in Berlin. At first, she went by the name Fräulein Unbekannt (German for Miss Unknown) as she refused to reveal her identity.<ref name=km93/> Later, she used the name Tschaikovsky and then Anderson. In March 1922, claims that Anderson was a Russian grand duchess first received public attention. Most members of Grand Duchess Anastasia's family and those who had known her, including court tutor Pierre Gilliard, said Anderson was an impostor but others were convinced she was Anastasia. In 1927, a private investigation funded by the Tsarina's brother, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, identified Anderson as Franziska Schanzkowska, a Polish factory worker with a history of mental illness. After a lawsuit lasting many years, the German courts ruled that Anderson had failed to prove she was Anastasia, but through media coverage, her claim gained notoriety.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 109; Kurth, Anastasia, pp. 10, 53</ref>
Between 1922 and 1968, Anderson lived in Germany and the United States with various supporters and in nursing homes and sanatoria, including at least one asylum. She emigrated to the United States in 1968. Shortly before the expiration of her visa she married history professor Jack Manahan, who was later characterized as "probably Charlottesville's best-loved eccentric".<ref name=hook>Tucker</ref> Upon her death in 1984, Anderson's body was cremated, and her ashes were buried in the churchyard at Seeon Abbey.
After the Revolutions of 1989 in the Soviet Union, the locations of the bodies of the Tsar, Tsarina, and all five of their children were revealed. Multiple laboratories in different countries confirmed their identity through DNA testing.<ref name="coble&rogaev"/> DNA tests on a lock of Anderson's hair and surviving medical samples of her tissue showed that her DNA did not match that of the Romanov remains or that of living relatives of the Romanovs.<ref>Stoneking et al.; Van der Kiste and Hall, p. 174</ref> Instead, Anderson's mitochondrial DNA matched that of Karl Maucher, a great-nephew of Franziska Schanzkowska.<ref name=stoneking>Stoneking et al.</ref> Most scientists, historians and journalists who have discussed the case accept that Anderson and Schanzkowska were the same person.<ref>Coble et al.; Gutterman; Massie, p. 249; Sieff; Sykes, p. 75</ref>
