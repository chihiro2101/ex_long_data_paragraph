Big Rock Candy Mountain

==History==
The song was first recorded by McClintock, also known by his "hobo" name of Haywire Mac. McClintock claimed credit for writing the song, though it was likely partially based on other ballads, including "An Invitation to Lubberland" and "The Appleknocker's Lament". Other popular itinerant songs of the day such as "Hobo's Paradise", "Hobo Heaven", "Sweet Potato Mountains" and "Little Streams of Whiskey" likely served as inspiration, as they mention concepts similar to those in "Big Rock Candy Mountain".<ref></ref>
Before recording the song, McClintock cleaned it up considerably from the version he sang as a street busker in the 1890s. Originally the song described a child being recruited into hobo life by tales of the "big rock candy mountain". In later years, when McClintock appeared in court as part of a copyright dispute, he cited the original words of the song, the last stanza of which was:
:”The punk rolled up his big blue eyes
:And said to the jocker, "Sandy,
:I've hiked and hiked and wandered too,
:But I ain't seen any candy.
:I've hiked and hiked till my feet are sore
:And I'll be damned if I hike any more
:To be buggered sore like a hobo's whore
:In the Big Rock Candy Mountains."
In the released version this verse did not appear.<ref></ref>
The song was not popularized until 1939, when it peaked at #1 on Billboard (magazine) country music charts. But it achieved more widespread popularity in 1949 when a sanitized version intended for children was re-recorded by Burl Ives. It has been recorded by many artists throughout the world, but a version recorded in 1960 by Dorsey Burnette to date was the biggest success for the song in the post-1954 "rock era", having reached No. 102 on Billboard's chart.
Sanitized versions have been popular, especially with children's musicians; in these, the "cigarette trees" become peppermint trees, and the "streams of alcohol" trickling down the rocks become streams of lemonade. The lake of gin is not mentioned, and the lake of whiskey becomes a lake of soda pop. The 2008 extended adaptation for children by Gil McLachlan tells the story as a child's dream, the last stanza being:
:In the Big Rock Candy Mountains you're going on a holiday
:Your birthday comes around once a week and it’s Christmas every day
:You never have to clean your room or put your toys away
:There's a little white horse you can ride of course
:You can jump so high you can touch the sky
:In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

"Big Rock Candy Mountain", first recorded by Harry McClintock in 1928, is a country folk song about a hobo's idea of paradise, a modern version of the medieval concept of Cockaigne. It is a place where "hens lay Soft-boiled egg" and there are "cigarette trees." McClintock claimed to have written the song in 1895, based on tales from his youth hoboing through the United States, but some believe that at least aspects of the song have existed for far longer. It is catalogued as Roud Folk Song Index No. 6696.<ref></ref>
