Attempts by Kenya to deport him were initially unsuccessful because of his involvement in terrorist activities.

In his book Ticking Time Bomb: Counter-Terrorism Lessons from the U.S. Government's Failure to Prevent the Fort Hood Attack (2011), former U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman described Australian Muslim preacher Feiz Mohammad, American-Yemeni imam Anwar al-Awlaki, el-Faisal, and Pakistani-American Samir Khan as "virtual spiritual sanctioners" who use the internet to offer religious justification for terrorism.<ref></ref>
On 25 August 2017, he was arrested in Jamaica after US officers caught him allegedly trying to recruit jihadis in an undercover sting operation. According to the Manhattan district attorney, he offered to help an undercover officer travel to the Middle East and join ISIL and was taken into custody in Jamaica to await extradition to the USA.<ref></ref>
In July 2020, Jamaica's Court of Appeal ruled the extradition to the USA could proceed, Faisal was extradited on 13 August 2020.
