Tagawa Matsu

== Giving birth by the stone ==
Tagawa Matsu was a Japanese woman from a samurai family in Hirado. Tagawa met and married a Han Chinese Hoklo named Zheng Zhilong from Nan'an, Fujian, China who frequently traded with the Japanese in Hirado. They fell in love with each other and married.<ref name="Hang2016"></ref>
Zheng Zhilong was said to be "very good looking" and when he first came to Japan he was 18 years old.<ref name="Wataru2013"></ref>
Tagawa was a few years older than Zheng and she was in her early twenties when they met. There are different accounts on how they met. In one of them she, along with other Japanese girls from Samurai families, were waiting on the Daimyō Matsuura at an evening party when she met Zheng. The meeting may have been deliberately arranged by Matsuura or her parents to help marry her off to a foreigner.<ref name="Clements2011"></ref> In another he met Tagawa while talking to girls along the beach in Hirado.<ref></ref> In another, Tagawa, an Ashigaru's daughter, was given to him by the daimyō.<ref></ref>
Another one by Liu Xianting (劉獻廷) in Guangyang Zaji (廣陽雜記) said that Tagawa was a widow when she met Zheng. It said that Zheng Zhilong fled to Japan when he was young and worked as a tailor. He lost his life savings of three coppers on a road and was looking for them but couldn't find them. He started crying but a Japanese widow who was standing inside the gate of her house saw him and asked him what was wrong. Zheng Zhilong told her and then she said to him "With your skill, you could easily make 3 million coppers, how could you arrive at this situation over 3 coppers?" She then invited Zheng to spend the night with her and they gave themselves to each other.<ref> urltoken 劉獻廷 廣陽雜記 卷二 鄭芝龍幼逃入日本，為人縫紉，以糊其口。余貲三錢，縫衣領中，失去，旁皇於路以求之，不得而泣。有倭婦新寡，立於門內，見而問之，芝龍告以故。婦曰：「以汝材力，三百萬亦如拾芥，三錢何至於是？」蓋其婦夜有異夢如韓蘄王之夫人也。遂以厚貲贈之，而與之夜合。芝龍後得志，取以為室，即賜姓之母也。</ref><ref name="Clements 2011"></ref>
She gave birth to Koxinga during a trip with her husband when she was picking seashells on the Senli Beach, Sennai River Bank (川內浦千里濱), Hirado. She gave him the Japanese name Fukumatsu. Zheng Zhilong gave him the Chinese name Zheng Sen, his name was later changed to Zheng Chenggong and granted the title Koxinga.
The stone beside which she gave birth still exists today as the Koxinga Child Birth Stone Tablet (鄭成功兒誕石碑), which is 80-cm tall and 3-metre wide, and submerged during high tides.

Being in her early twenties, and being older than Zheng Zhilong have raised the possibility Tagawa was a widow before she met Zheng since it was unusual for a woman to not be married by this age. Tagawa was the first woman Zheng fell in love with and they were viewed as having a common-law marriage already. However, the group of traders working with Captain China wanted to arrange for a Chinese woman, Lady Yan to marry Zheng Zhilong.<ref></ref>
After the birth of Koxinga, she was still visited in Japan by Zheng Zhilong sometimes according to sources from their time.<ref></ref>
She had another son named Shichizaemon in 1629 and gave him her family's surname, Tagawa. Sources say that Zheng Zhilong was the father and that he visited Hirado to impregnate her with Shichizayemon<ref name="London1936"></ref> and that he received the surname Tagawa because he was adopted by Tagawa Matsu's parents but others say Shichizaemon was the product of an unknown Japanese man which is why he was given Tagawa's surname and not Zheng.<ref></ref><ref></ref> He became an ashigaru samurai.<ref name="Andrade2011b"></ref> The Taiwan Waiji does not mention Shichizaemon.<ref>Sazvar, Nastaran. “ZHENG CHENGGONG (1624-1662): EIN HELD IM WANDEL DER ZEIT: DIE VERZERRUNG EINER HISTORISCHEN FIGUR DURCH MYTHISCHE VERKLÄRUNG UND POLITISCHE INSTRUMENTALISIERUNG.” Monumenta Serica, vol. 58, 2010, pp. 165.

== Dispute over background ==
Tagawa's real first name is unknown and she is only known by her surname Tagawa in Japan and China. According to Japanese folklore in Hirado her name was Matsu.<ref name="Carioti2006"></ref><ref>角田文衛『日本の女性名――歴史的展望』国書刊行会 2006年（底本 教育社歴史新書 1980年–1988年 全3巻）p.287</ref>
===Half-Chinese theory===
In the Zheng family genealogy, Tagawa Matsu is recorded under the Sinicized name of Weng-shi. Some Chinese records indicated that this is because after she moved to Quanzhou, an old ironsmith neighbour, Weng Yihuang (翁翌皇),<ref>館森鴻《朱成功傳》：泉州鐵匠翁姓，住飛鸞台，為某邑主鍛鍊刀劍，曾娶田川氏女子。芝龍即聘其女而生成功，此即翁氏之由。</ref> treated this foreigner newcomer like his own daughter.
There are a small number of Chinese sources mistaking Tagawa Matsu as Weng Yihuang's blood daughter, with a Japanese mother surnamed Tagawa. Chinese on Taiwan who seek to downplay Tagawa Matsu's Japanese identity accept this theory that she was the daughter of the Chinese Weng Yihuang and a Japanese Tagawa woman,<ref name="Clements 2011"/><ref>Sazvar, Nastaran. “ZHENG CHENGGONG (1624–1662): EIN HELD IM WANDEL DER ZEIT: DIE VERZERRUNG EINER HISTORISCHEN FIGUR DURCH MYTHISCHE VERKLÄRUNG UND POLITISCHE INSTRUMENTALISIERUNG.” Monumenta Serica, vol. 58, 2010, pp. 160. JSTOR, JSTOR, urltoken making Koxinga only one fourth Japanese through one Japanese grandmother.
According to hearsay heard by Tatemori Ko, Tagawa Matsu was the daughter of a Japanese woman Tagawa and the Chinese swordsmith Weng (O in Japanese), Tagawa married Weng after the Hirado Daimio had a sword forged for him by Weng after he went from China to Japan, and then the Tagawa woman and Weng had a daughter (Tagawa Matsu) who married Zheng Zhilong, according to the 1913 book Shu Seiko Den by Tatemori Ko.<ref name="London1936b"></ref> The Taiwan source "Free China Review" also claims this.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
This is unlikely, as this would necessitate either Weng Yihuang moving to Japan (but he was an ironsmith, neither a sailor nor a trader) or the migration of the Tagawa women back and forth between the two nations (but traveling of women was restricted).
===Adopted theory===
Other sources say that Weng Yihuang was her stepfather, that Weng Yihuang married Tagawa Matsu's widowed Japanese mother after Tagawa Matsu's Japanese father died and adopted her as his stepdaughter.<ref>湯錦台《開啟台灣第一人鄭芝龍》，頁七十五。</ref><ref>伊能嘉矩《台灣文化誌》：「有泉州鐵匠翁翊皇其人，曾寄寓於平戶而歸化於日本，因無子而以田川氏之女為子。其間鄭芝龍疊次來遊，遂娶此女云。」</ref><ref>史籍中無田川之名諱。但由平戶市教育委員會所製作的導覽牌上，則稱「鄭芝龍和平戶的女性（傳說為「田川マツ」）生下鄭成功。」「マツ」即「松」。</ref>
===Prostitute or Princess===
The Zheng family's enemies attacked Tagawa by suggesting she was a Japanese prostitute Zheng Zhilong picked up, while Tagawa's Japanese descendants claim she was a descendant of the Japanese Imperial family.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> This traces her descent to Japan's 50th Emperor, Kammu Tenno, 19 generations from Tagawa Matsu through Taira no Shigemori and Tagawa Yazayemon 田川 弥左衛門.<ref name="Clements 2011"/> The English diplomat R. A. B Posonby-Fane pushed the theory that Tagawa was a Japanese woman from a high class Samurai background. It is agreed by modern historians that she was neither and that she was a Japanese girl from an average Samurai family, not of high rank and not a prostitute.<ref>Sazvar, Nastaran. “ZHENG CHENGGONG (1624–1662): EIN HELD IM WANDEL DER ZEIT: DIE VERZERRUNG EINER HISTORISCHEN FIGUR DURCH MYTHISCHE VERKLÄRUNG UND POLITISCHE INSTRUMENTALISIERUNG.” Monumenta Serica, vol. 58, 2010, pp. 160–161.

===Samurai===
Japanese sources say she was full blooded Japanese. Japanese sources say that her samurai father was either Lord Matsuura's Samurai Tagawa Yazayemon<ref name="Clements2011"/> or her father's name was Tagawa Shichizaemon whom she named her second son after.<ref name="Shiba2007 b"></ref><ref> urltoken According to stories passed down by Japanese in Hirado, Tagawa Matsu's father was Tagawa Shichizaemon (田川七左衛門) whom she named her second son after.
The samurai Tagawa Yazayemon was an ashigaru according to Hirado folklore and there was nothing else describing him as that according to Inagaki. In Taiyo, an article was written by Matsui Nobuaki which said that Tagawa Yazayemon was not Tagawa Matsu's father but instead her father was Tagawa Shichizayemon.<ref name="London1936c"></ref>
Wong said he cannot link her to the Ashigaru or the Tagawa samurai family.<ref name="Wong2017"></ref>

== Descendants ==
In Koxinga Memorial Temple (鄭成功祠) in Tainan, Taiwan, Tagawa Matsu's ancestral tablet is placed in a chamber called the Shrine of Queen Dowager Weng (翁太妃祠). The title "queen dowager" is a posthumous title based on the princeship/kingship of Koxinga (Prince-King of Yanping Prefecture) in the Southern Ming Empire.
Tagawa's ancestral tablet was saved after the Qing attack.<ref></ref>
Tagawa Matsu's descendants through Koxinga live in both mainland China and Taiwan and her descendants through Shichizaemon live in Japan. Her descendants through her great-grandson Zheng Keshuang served as Han Bannermen in Beijing until 1911 when the Xinhai revolution broke out and the Qing dynasty fell, after which they moved back to Anhai and Nan'an in southern Fujian in mainland China. They still live there to this day.<ref></ref> Her descendants through her grandson Zheng Kuan live in Taiwan.<ref></ref> Zheng Daoshun was the son of Shichizaemon and he adopted the Zheng surname.<ref></ref>
The "Asiatic Society of Japan" said "It was five years after the birth of Teiseiko (Koxinga) that his father (Zheng Zhilong) left for China and accepted the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial forces. Soon after his departure, his wife gave birth to a second son who was named Shichizaemon" who spend his life wholly in Japan and did not develop the love for adventure and renown which made his elder brother so famous. " "The descendants of Shichizaemon served the Government for many years as interpreters of Chinese, and there reside to this day in Nagasaki certain Japanese who point with pride to their ancestor."<ref name="Japan1895"></ref>
One of Tagawa's Chinese descendants, Zheng Xiaoxuan 鄭曉嵐 the father of Zheng Chouyu, fought against the Japanese invaders in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Zheng Chouyu 鄭愁予 was born in Shandong in mainland China in 1933 and called himself a "child of the resistance" against Japan and he became a refugee during the war, moving from place to place across China to avoid the Japanese. He moved to Taiwan in 1949 and focuses his work on building stronger ties between Taiwan and mainland China.<ref> urltoken Zheng Chouyu was born in mainland China, he identified as Chinese and he felt alienated after he was forced to move to Taiwan in 1949 which was previously under Japanese rule and felt strange and foreign to him.<ref name="Au2008"></ref> He is Koxinga's 11th generation descendant and his original name is Zheng Wenji.<ref></ref>
