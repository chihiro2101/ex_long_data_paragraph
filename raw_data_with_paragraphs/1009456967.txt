Timeline of quantum computing and communication

==1960s==
=== 1968===
* Stephen Wiesner invents conjugate coding. (manuscript written while participating in the Columbia University student protests of April 1968 and eventually published in ACM SIGACT News 15(1):78–88) <ref>Mor, T and Renner, R, Preface to Special Issue on Quantum Cryptography,
Natural Computing 13(4):447-452, DOI: 10.1007/s11047-014-9464-3</ref>
==1970s==
=== 1970 ===
* James Park articulates the no-cloning theorem <ref name="park"></ref>
=== 1973 ===
* Alexander Holevo publishes a paper showing that n qubits can carry more than n classical bits of information, but at most n classical bits are accessible (a result known as "Holevo's theorem" or "Holevo's bound").
* Charles H. Bennett shows that computation can be done reversibly.<ref></ref>
=== 1975 ===
* R. P. Poplavskii publishes "Thermodynamical models of information processing" (in Russian)<ref name="Poplavskii"></ref> which showed the computational infeasibility of simulating quantum systems on classical computers, due to the superposition principle.
=== 1976 ===
* Polish mathematical physicist Roman Stanisław Ingarden publishes a seminal paper entitled "Quantum Information Theory" in Reports on Mathematical Physics, vol. 10, 43–72, 1976. (The paper was submitted in 1975.) It is one of the first attempts at creating a quantum information theory, showing that Shannon information theory cannot directly be generalized to the quantum case, but rather that it is possible to construct a quantum information theory, which is a generalization of Shannon's theory, within the formalism of a generalized quantum mechanics of open systems and a generalized concept of observables (the so-called semi-observables).
==1980s==
===1980===
* Paul Benioff describes the first quantum mechanical model of a computer. In this work, Benioff showed that a computer could operate under the laws of quantum mechanics by describing a Schrödinger equation description of Turing machines, laying a foundation for further work in quantum computing. The paper <ref></ref> was submitted in June 1979 and published in April 1980. 
* Yuri Manin briefly motivates the idea of quantum computing<ref name="manin1980vychislimoe"></ref>
* Tommaso Toffoli introduces the reversible Toffoli gate,<ref>Technical Report MIT/LCS/TM-151 (1980) and an adapted and condensed version: </ref> which, together with the NOT and XOR gates provides a universal set for reversible classical computation.
===1980===
* At the First Conference on the Physics of Computation, held at MIT in May, Paul Benioff and Richard Feynman give talks on quantum computing. Benioff's built on his earlier 1980 work showing that a computer can operate under the laws of quantum mechanics. The talk was titled “Quantum mechanical Hamiltonian models of discrete processes that erase their own histories: application to Turing machines”.<ref></ref> In Feynman's talk, he observed that it appeared to be impossible to efficiently simulate an evolution of a quantum system on a classical computer, and he proposed a basic model for a quantum computer.<ref>Simulating physics with computers urltoken 
===1982===
* Paul Benioff further develops his original model of a quantum mechanical Turing machine.<ref></ref>
* William Wootters and Wojciech Zurek,<ref></ref> and independently Dennis Dieks<ref></ref> rediscover the no-cloning theorem.
===1984===
*Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard employ Wiesner's conjugate coding for distribution of cryptographic keys.<ref></ref>
===1985===
* David Deutsch, at the University of Oxford, describes the first universal quantum computer. Just as a Universal Turing machine can simulate any other Turing machine efficiently (Church-Turing thesis), so the universal quantum computer is able to simulate any other quantum computer with at most a polynomial slowdown.
* Asher Peres points out need for quantum error correction schemes and discusses a repetition code for amplitude errors.<ref></ref>
===1988===
* Yoshihisa Yamamoto (scientist) and K. Igeta propose the first physical realization of a quantum computer, including Feynman's CNOT gate.<ref name="qc1988">K. Igeta and Y. Yamamoto. "Quantum mechanical computers with single atom and photon fields." International Quantum Electronics Conference (1988) urltoken Their approach uses atoms and photons and is the progenitor of modern quantum computing and networking protocols using photons to transmit qubits and atoms to perform two-qubit operations.
===1989===
* Gerard J. Milburn proposes a quantum-optical realization of a Fredkin gate.<ref name="fredkin1988">G. J. Milburn. "Quantum optical Fredkin gate." Physical Review Letters 62, 2124 (1989) urltoken 
* Bikas K. Chakrabarti & collaborators from Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata, propose the idea that quantum fluctuations could help explore rugged energy landscapes by escaping from local minima of glassy systems having tall but thin barriers by tunneling (instead of climbing over using thermal excitations), suggesting the effectiveness of quantum annealing over classical simulated annealing.<ref name="Chakrabarti89"></ref><ref></ref>
==1990s==
===1991===
* Artur Ekert at the University of Oxford, expands on the original proposal by David Deutsch,<ref></ref> for entanglement-based secure communication.<ref></ref>
===1992=== 
* David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa propose a computational problem that can be solved efficiently with the determinist Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm on a quantum computer, but for which no deterministic classical algorithm is possible. This was perhaps the earliest result in the computational complexity of quantum computers, proving that they were capable of performing some well-defined computational task more efficiently than any classical computer.
===1993===
* Dan Simon, at Université de Montréal, invents an oracle problem for which a quantum computer would be exponential growth than a conventional computer. This algorithm introduces the main ideas which were then developed in Shor's algorithm.
===1994===
* Peter Shor, at AT"T's Bell Labs in New Jersey, discovers an important algorithm. It allows a quantum computer to factor large integers quickly. It solves both the factoring problem and the discrete log problem. Shor's algorithm can theoretically break many of the cryptosystems in use today. Its invention sparked a tremendous interest in quantum computers.
* First United States Government workshop on quantum computing is organized by NIST in Gaithersburg, in autumn.
* Isaac Chuang and Yoshihisa Yamamoto (scientist) propose a quantum-optical realization of a quantum computer to implement Deutsch's algorithm.<ref name="cy1995">Isaac L. Chuang and Yoshihisa Yamamoto. "Simple quantum computer." Physical Review A 52, 3489 (1995)</ref> Their work introduces dual-rail encoding for photonic qubits.
* In December, Ignacio Cirac, at University of Castilla-La Mancha at Ciudad Real, and Peter Zoller at the University of Innsbruck propose an experimental realization of the controlled-NOT gate with cold trapped ions.
===1995===
* The first United States Department of Defense workshop on quantum computing and quantum cryptography is organized by United States Army physicists Charles M. Bowden, Jonathan P. Dowling, and Henry O. Everitt; it takes place in February at the University of Arizona in Tucson.
*Peter Shor proposes the first schemes for quantum error correction.<ref>
</ref>
* Christopher Monroe and David Wineland at NIST (Boulder, Colorado) experimentally realize the first quantum logic gate – the controlled-NOT gate – with trapped ions, following the Cirac-Zoller proposal.<ref></ref>
===1996===
*Lov Grover, at Bell Labs, invents the Grover's algorithm. The quadratic speedup is not as dramatic as the speedup for factoring, discrete logs, or physics simulations. However, the algorithm can be applied to a much wider variety of problems. Any problem that has to be solved by random, brute-force search, can take advantage of this quadratic speedup (in the number of search queries).
*The United States Government, particularly in a joint partnership of the Army Research Office (now part of the Army Research Laboratory) and the National Security Agency, issues the first public call for research proposals in quantum information processing.
*Andrew Steane designs Steane codes for error correction.<ref></ref>
*David P. DiVincenzo, from IBM, proposes a list of minimal requirements for creating a quantum computer.<ref></ref>
===1997===
*David Cory, Amr Fahmy and Timothy Havel, and at the same time Neil Gershenfeld and Isaac L. Chuang at MIT publish the first papers realizing gates for quantum computers based on bulk nuclear spin resonance, or thermal ensembles. The technology is based on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) machine, which is similar to the medical magnetic resonance imaging machine.
*Alexei Kitaev describes the principles of topological quantum computation as a method for combating decoherence.<ref></ref>
*Daniel Loss and David P. DiVincenzo propose the Loss-DiVincenzo quantum computer, using as qubits the intrinsic spin-1/2 degree of freedom of individual electrons confined to quantum dots.<ref>D. Loss and D. P. DiVincenzo, "Quantum computation with quantum dots", Phys. Rev. A 57, p120 (1998); urltoken on arXiv.org in Jan. 1997</ref>
===1998===
* First experimental demonstration of a quantum algorithm. A working 2-qubit NMR quantum computer is used to solve Deutsch's problem by Jonathan A. Jones and Michele Mosca at Oxford University and shortly after by Isaac L. Chuang at IBM's Almaden Research Center and Mark Kubinec and the University of California, Berkeley together with coworkers at Stanford University and MIT.<ref></ref>
* First working 3-qubit NMR computer.
* Bruce Kane proposes a silicon based Kane quantum computer, using nuclear spins of individual phosphorus atoms in silicon as the qubits and donor electrons to mediate the coupling between qubits.<ref></ref>
* First execution of Grover's algorithm on an NMR computer.
* Hidetoshi Nishimori & colleagues from Tokyo Institute of Technology showed that quantum annealing algorithm can perform better than classical simulated annealing.
* Daniel Gottesman and Emanuel Knill independently prove that a certain subclass of quantum computations can be efficiently emulated with classical resources (Gottesman–Knill theorem).<ref></ref>
===1999===
* Samuel L. Braunstein and collaborators show that none of the bulk NMR experiments performed to date contained any entanglement, the quantum states being too strongly mixed. This is seen as evidence that NMR computers would likely not yield a benefit over classical computers. It remains an open question, however, whether entanglement is necessary for quantum computational speedup.<ref></ref>
* Gabriel Aeppli, Thomas Felix Rosenbaum and colleagues demonstrate experimentally the basic concepts of quantum annealing in a condensed matter system.
* Yasunobu Nakamura and Jaw-Shen Tsai demonstrate that a superconducting circuit can be used as a qubit.<ref name="nt1999">Y. Nakamura, Yu. A. Pashkin and J. S. Tsai. "Coherent control of macroscopic quantum states in a single-Cooper-pair box." Nature 398, 786–788 (1999) urltoken 
==2000s==
===2000===
*Arun K. Pati and Samuel L. Braunstein proved the quantum no-deleting theorem. This is dual to the no-cloning theorem which shows that one cannot delete a copy of an unknown qubit. Together with the stronger no-cloning theorem, the no-deleting theorem has important implication, i.e., quantum information can neither be created nor be destroyed.
* First working 5-qubit NMR computer demonstrated at the Technical University of Munich.
* First execution of order finding (part of Shor's algorithm) at IBM's Almaden Research Center and Stanford University.
* First working 7-qubit NMR computer demonstrated at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
* The standard textbook, Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, by Michael Nielsen and Isaac Chuang is published.
===2001===
*First execution of Shor's algorithm at IBM's Almaden Research Center and Stanford University. The number 15 was factored using 10<sup>18</sup> identical molecules, each containing seven active nuclear spins.
* Noah Linden and Sandu Popescu proved that the presence of entanglement is a necessary condition for a large class of quantum protocols. This, coupled with Braunstein's result (see 1999 above), called the validity of NMR quantum computation into question.<ref></ref>
*Emanuel Knill, Raymond Laflamme, and Gerard Milburn show that optical quantum computing is possible with single photon sources, linear optical elements, and single photon detectors, launching the field of linear optical quantum computing.
* Robert Raussendorf and Hans Jürgen Briegel propose One-way quantum computer.<ref></ref>
===2002===
*The Quantum Information Science and Technology Roadmapping Project, involving some of the main participants in the field, laid out the urltoken Quantum computation roadmap.

===2005===
* University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign scientists demonstrate quantum entanglement of multiple characteristics, potentially allowing multiple qubits per particle.
* Two teams of physicists measured the capacitance of a Josephson junction for the first time. The methods could be used to measure the state of quantum bits in a quantum computer without disturbing the state.<ref></ref>
* In December, the first quantum byte, or qubyte, is announced to have been created by scientists at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information and the University of Innsbruck in Austria.<ref></ref>
