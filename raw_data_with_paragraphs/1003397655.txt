Exercise

== Classification ==
Physical exercises are generally grouped into three types, depending on the overall effect they have on the human body:<ref name="phy_active"></ref>
* Aerobic exercise is any physical activity that uses large muscle groups and causes the body to use more oxygen than it would while resting.<ref name="phy_active" /> The goal of aerobic exercise is to increase cardiovascular endurance.<ref></ref> Examples of aerobic exercise include running, cycling, swimming, brisk walking, skipping rope, rowing, hiking, dancing, playing tennis, continuous training, and long distance running.<ref name="phy_active" />
* Anaerobic exercise, which includes strength and resistance training, can firm, strengthen, and increase muscle mass, as well as improve bone density, balance, and coordination.<ref name="phy_active" /> Examples of strength exercises are push-ups, pull-ups, lunges, squats, bench press. Anaerobic exercise also includes weight training, functional training, Eccentric Training, interval training, sprinting, and high-intensity interval training which increase short-term muscle strength.<ref name="phy_active" /><ref></ref>
* Flexibility exercises stretch and lengthen muscles.<ref name="phy_active" /> Activities such as stretching help to improve joint flexibility and keep muscles limber.<ref name="phy_active" /> The goal is to improve the range of motion which can reduce the chance of injury.<ref name="phy_active" /><ref></ref>
Physical exercise can also include training that focuses on accuracy, agility, power, and speed.<ref name="crossfit"></ref>
Types of exercise can also be classified as dynamic or static. 'Dynamic' exercises such as steady running, tend to produce a lowering of the diastole blood pressure during exercise, due to the improved blood flow. Conversely, static exercise (such as weight-lifting) can cause the systolic pressure to rise significantly, albeit transiently, during the performance of the exercise.<ref></ref><!--

== Health effects ==
=== Other peripheral organs ===
Developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known as myokines which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and multiple anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases.<ref></ref> Exercise reduces levels of cortisol, which causes many health problems, both physical and mental.<ref></ref> Endurance exercise before meals lowers blood glucose more than the same exercise after meals.<ref></ref> There is evidence that vigorous exercise (90–95% of VO2 max) induces a greater degree of physiological cardiac hypertrophy than moderate exercise (40 to 70% of VO<sub>2</sub> max), but it is unknown whether this has any effects on overall morbidity and/or mortality.<ref></ref> Both aerobic and anaerobic exercise work to increase the mechanical efficiency of the heart by increasing cardiac volume (aerobic exercise), or myocardial thickness (strength training). Ventricular hypertrophy, the thickening of the ventricular walls, is generally beneficial and healthy if it occurs in response to exercise.
=== Central nervous system ===
The effects of physical exercise on the central nervous system are mediated in part by specific neurotrophic factor myokine, including BDNF, IGF-1, and VEGF.<ref name="Exercise – neurotrophic factors + basal ganglia"></ref><ref name="BDNF meta analysis"></ref><ref name="VEGF aging brain"></ref><ref name="Fitness mechanism"></ref><ref name="Comprehensive review – repeat citation"></ref><ref name="Cerebral hemodynamics and AD"></ref>
== Public health measures ==
Multiple component community-wide campaigns are frequently used in an attempt to increase a population's level of physical activity. A 2015 Cochrane review, however, did not find evidence supporting a benefit.<ref name=":0"></ref> The quality of the underlying evidence was also poor.<ref name=":0" /> However, there is some evidence that school-based interventions can increase activity levels and fitness in children.<ref name="Dobbins" /> Another Cochrane review found some evidence that certain types of exercise programmes, such as those involving gait, balance, co-ordination and functional tasks, can improve balance in older adults.<ref></ref> Following progressive resistance training, older adults also respond with improved physical function.<ref></ref> Survey of brief interventions promoting physical activity found that they are cost-effective, although there are variations between studies.<ref></ref>
Environmental approaches appear promising: signs that encourage the use of stairs, as well as community campaigns, may increase exercise levels.<ref></ref> The city of Bogotá, Colombia, for example, blocks off of roads on Sundays and holidays to make it easier for its citizens to get exercise. Such pedestrian zones are part of an effort to combat chronic diseases and to maintain a healthy BMI.<ref></ref><ref name="Dons"></ref>
To identify which public health strategies are effective, a Cochrane overview of reviews is in preparation.<ref></ref>
Physical exercise was said to decrease healthcare costs, increase the rate of job attendance, as well as increase the amount of effort women put into their jobs.<ref></ref> There is some level of concern about additional exposure to air pollution when Outdoor fitness, especially near traffic.<ref name="Laeremans et al. 2018"></ref>
Children will mimic the behavior of their parents in relation to physical exercise. Parents can thus promote physical activity and limit the amount of time children spend in front of screens.<ref></ref>
Children who are overweight and participate in physical exercise experience a greater loss of body fat and increased cardiovascular fitness. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, children and adolescents should do 60 minutes or more of physical activity each day.<ref></ref> Implementing physical exercise in the school system and ensuring an environment in which children can reduce barriers to maintain a healthy lifestyle is essential.
The European Commission's Directorate-General for Education and Culture (DG EAC) has dedicated programs and funds for Health Enhancing Physical Activity (HEPA) projects<ref></ref> within its Horizon 2020 and Erasmus+ program, as research showed that too many Europeans are not physically active enough. Financing is available for increased collaboration between players active in this field across the EU and around the world, the promotion of HEPA in the EU and its partner countries, and the European Sports Week. The DG EAC regularly publishes a Eurobarometer on sport and physical activity.
== Exercise trends ==
Worldwide there has been a large shift toward less physically demanding work.<ref name=WHO2009></ref> This has been accompanied by increasing use of mechanized transportation, a greater prevalence of labor-saving technology in the home, and fewer active recreational pursuits.<ref name=WHO2009 /> Personal lifestyle changes, however, can correct the lack of physical exercise.
Research published in 2015 suggests that incorporating mindfulness into physical exercise interventions increases exercise adherence and self-efficacy, and also has positive effects both psychologically and physiologically.<ref name=Kennedy></ref>
=== Social and cultural variation ===
Exercising looks different in every country, as do the motivations behind exercising.<ref name="Fitness for Foreigners" /> In some countries, people exercise primarily indoors, while in others, people primarily Outdoor fitness. People may exercise for personal enjoyment, health and well-being, social interactions, competition or training, etc. These differences could potentially be attributed to a variety of reasons including geographic location and social tendencies.
In Colombia, for example, citizens value and celebrate the outdoor environments of their country. In many instances, they utilize outdoor activities as social gatherings to enjoy nature and their communities. In Bogotá, Colombia, a 70-mile stretch of road known as the Ciclovía is shut down each Sunday for bicyclists, runners, rollerbladers, skateboarders and other exercisers to work out and enjoy their surroundings.<ref></ref>
Similarly to Colombia, citizens of Cambodia tend to exercise socially outside. In this country, public gyms have become quite popular. People will congregate at these outdoor gyms not only to utilize the public facilities, but also to organize aerobics and dance sessions, which are open to the public.<ref></ref>
Sweden has also begun developing outdoor gyms, called utegym. These gyms are free to the public and are often placed in beautiful, picturesque environments. People will swim in rivers, use boats, and run through forests to stay healthy and enjoy the natural world around them. This works particularly well in Sweden due to its geographical location.<ref></ref>
Exercise in some areas of China, particularly among those who are retired, seems to be socially grounded. In the mornings, dances are held in public parks; these gatherings may include Latin dancing, ballroom dancing, tango, or even the jitterbug. Dancing in public allows people to interact with those with whom they would not normally interact, allowing for both health and social benefits.<ref></ref>
These sociocultural variations in physical exercise show how people in different geographic locations and social climates have varying motivations and methods of exercising. Physical exercise can improve health and well-being, as well as enhance community ties and appreciation of natural beauty.<ref name="Fitness for Foreigners" />
== Nutrition and recovery ==
Proper nutrition is as important to health as exercise. When exercising, it becomes even more important to have a good diet to ensure that the body has the correct ratio of macronutrients while providing ample micronutrients, in order to aid the body with the recovery process following strenuous exercise.<ref></ref>
Active recovery is recommended after participating in physical exercise because it removes lactate from the blood more quickly than inactive recovery. Removing lactate from circulation allows for an easy decline in body temperature, which can also benefit the immune system, as an individual may be vulnerable to minor illnesses if the body temperature drops too abruptly after physical exercise.<ref name="pmid16195010"></ref>
== Excessive exercise ==
Excessive exercise or overtraining occurs when a person exceeds their body's ability to recover from strenuous exercise.<ref></ref>
== History ==
The benefits of exercise have been known since antiquity. Dating back to 65 BCE, it was Cicero, Roman politician and lawyer, who stated: "It is exercise alone that supports the spirits, and keeps the mind in vigor."<ref></ref> Exercise was also seen to be valued later in history during the Early Middle Ages as a means of survival by the Germanic peoples of Northern Europe.<ref></ref>
More recently, exercise was regarded as a beneficial force in the 19th century. In 1858 Archibald MacLaren opened a gymnasium at the University of Oxford and instituted a training regimen for Major Frederick Hammersley and 12 non-commissioned officers.<ref></ref> This regimen was assimilated into the training of the British Army, which formed the Army Gymnastic Staff in 1860 and made sport an important part of military life.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> Several mass exercise movements were started in the early twentieth century as well. The first and most significant of these in the UK was the Women's League of Health and Beauty, founded in 1930 by Mary Bagot Stack, that had 166,000 members in 1937.<ref name=FitnessLeague></ref>
The link between physical health and exercise (or lack of it) was further established in 1949 and reported in 1953 by a team led by Jerry Morris.<ref></ref><ref name="Morris1953"></ref> Dr. Morris noted that men of similar social class and occupation (bus conductors versus bus drivers) had markedly different rates of heart attacks, depending on the level of exercise they got: bus drivers had a sedentary occupation and a higher incidence of heart disease, while bus conductors were forced to move continually and had a lower incidence of heart disease.<ref name="Morris1953" />
== Other animals ==
Studies of animals indicate that physical activity may be more adaptable than changes in food intake to regulate energy balance.<ref></ref>
Mice having access to Hamster wheel engaged in voluntary exercise and increased their propensity to run as adults.<ref></ref> Selective breeding of mice exhibited significant heredity in voluntary exercise levels,<ref></ref> with "high-runner" breeds having enhanced VO2 max,<ref></ref> hippocampus neurogenesis,<ref></ref> and skeletal muscle morphology.<ref></ref>
The effects of exercise training appear to be heterogeneous across non-mammalian species. As examples, exercise training of salmon showed minor improvements of endurance,<ref></ref> and a forced swimming regimen of yellowtail amberjack and rainbow trout accelerated their growth rates and altered muscle morphology favorable for sustained swimming.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Crocodiles, alligators, and ducks showed elevated aerobic capacity following exercise training.<ref name="Owerk_Baud_2008"></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> No effect of endurance training was found in most studies of lizards,<ref name="Owerk_Baud_2008" /><ref name="Garland_et_al_1987"></ref> although one study did report a training effect.<ref name="jeb"></ref> In lizards, sprint training had no effect on maximal exercise capacity,<ref name=jeb /> and muscular damage from over-training occurred following weeks of forced treadmill exercise.<ref name="Garland_et_al_1987" />

Exercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness.<ref></ref>
It is performed for various reasons, to aid growth and improve strength, preventing aging, developing muscles and the cardiovascular system, honing sport skills, weight loss or maintenance, improving health<ref></ref> and also for enjoyment. Many individuals choose to Outdoor fitness where they can congregate in groups, socialize, and enhance well-being.<ref name="Fitness for Foreigners"></ref>
In terms of health benefits, the amount of recommended exercise depends upon the goal, the type of exercise, and the age of the person. Even doing a small amount of exercise is healthier than doing none.<ref></ref>
