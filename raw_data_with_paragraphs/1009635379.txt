Bob Woodward

==Criticism==
===Style===
Woodward often uses unnamed sources in his reporting for the Post and in his books. Using extensive interviews with firsthand witnesses, documents, meeting notes, diaries, calendars, and other documentation, Woodward attempts to construct a seamless narrative of events, most often told through the eyes of the key participants.
Nicholas von Hoffman has made the criticism that "arrestingly irrelevant detail is often used",<ref>Nicholas von Hoffman, "Unasked Questions," The New York Review of Books, June 10, 1976, Vol. 23, Number 10.</ref> while Michael Massing believes Woodward's books are "filled with long, at times tedious passages with no evident direction."<ref>Michael Massing, "Sitting on Top of the News," The New York Review of Books, June 27, 1991, Vol. 38, Number 12.</ref>
Joan Didion published a comprehensive criticism of Woodward in a lengthy September 1996 essay in The New York Review of Books.<ref>Joan Didion, "The Deferential Spirit," The New York Review of Books, September 19, 1996, Vol. 43, Number 14.</ref> Though "Woodward is a widely trusted reporter, even an American icon", she says that he assembles reams of often irrelevant detail, fails to draw conclusions, and make judgments. "Measurable cerebral activity is virtually absent" from his books after Watergate from 1979 to 1996, she said. She said the books are notable for "a scrupulous passivity, an agreement to cover the story not as it is occurring but as it is presented, which is to say as it is manufactured." She ridicules "fairness" as "a familiar newsroom piety, the excuse in practice for a good deal of autopilot reporting and lazy thinking." All this focus on what people said and thought—their "decent intentions"—circumscribes "possible discussion or speculation", resulting in what she called "political pornography".
The Posts Richard Harwood defended Woodward in a September 6, 1996, column, arguing that Woodward's method is that of a reporter—"talking to people you write about, checking and cross-checking their versions of contemporary history," and collecting documentary evidence in notes, letters, and records."<ref>Richard Harwood, "Deconstructing Bob Woodward," The Washington Post, September 6, 1996, p. A23.</ref>

*Woodward has been accused of exaggeration and fabrication regarding "Deep Throat", his Watergate informant. After W. Mark Felt was announced as the true identity behind Deep Throat in 2005, John Dean<ref></ref> and Ed Gray,<ref></ref> in separate publications, used Woodward's book All The President's Men and his published notes on his meetings with Deep Throat to argue that Deep Throat could not have been only Mark Felt. They argued that Deep Throat was a fictional composite made up of several Woodward sources, only one of whom was Felt. Gray, in his book In Nixon's Web, even went so far as to publish an e-mail and telephone exchange he had with Donald Santarelli, a Washington lawyer who was a Justice Department official during Watergate, in which Santarelli confirmed to Gray that he was the source behind statements Woodward recorded in notes he has attributed to Deep Throat.<ref></ref> However, Stephen Mielke, an archivist at the University of Texas who oversees the Woodward-Bernstein papers, said it is likely the page was misfiled under Felt because no source was identified. The original page of notes is in the Mark Felt file but "the carbon is located with the handwritten and typed notes attributed to Santarelli." Ed Gray said that Santarelli confirmed to him that he was the source behind the statements in the notes.<ref>Stephen Mielke (Archivist), finding aid in Woodward's handwritten and typed interview notes, 1972–73, in the Watergate Papers at the Harry Ransom Center, The University of Texas at Austin</ref>
*J. Bradford DeLong has noted considerable inconsistencies between the accounts of the making of Clinton economic policy described in Woodward's book Maestro and his book The Agenda.<ref></ref>
*Some of Woodward's critics accuse him of abandoning critical inquiry to maintain his access to high-profile political actors. Anthony Lewis called the style "a trade in which the great grant access in return for glory."<ref></ref> Christopher Hitchens accused Woodward of acting as "stenographer to the rich and powerful."<ref></ref>
*Writer Tanner Colby, who co-wrote a biography of John Belushi with the late actor's widow Judy, wrote in Slate that, while Woodward's frequently criticized 1984 book Wired (book) is largely accurate in its description of events, Woodward either gets the context wrong or does not find any context at all. For example, Belushi's grandmother's funeral, which led him to make a serious effort to sober up, gets merely a paragraph in Woodward's retelling, while a 24-hour drug binge in Los Angeles goes on for eight pages simply because the limo driver was willing to talk to Woodward. "It's like someone wrote a biography of Michael Jordan in which all the stats and scores are correct, but you come away with the impression that Michael Jordan wasn't very good at playing basketball," he concluded. Because it was unique among Woodward's books in that it made no use of confidential or anonymous sources, Colby was able to interview many of the same sources that Woodward had used, making comparisons of their recollection of events to Woodward's accounting of them relatively easy.<ref></ref>
*Woodward believed the Bush administration's claims of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction before the war, and the publication of the book At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA by former Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet led Woodward to engage in a rather tortuous account of the extent of his pre-war conversations with Tenet in an article in The New Yorker in which he also chastised New York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd for being critical of him.<ref></ref>
*Woodward was also accused of fabricating a deathbed interview with CIA Director William Casey, as described in Veil. Critics say the interview simply could not have taken place as written in the book.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> Robert Gates, Casey's deputy at the time, in his book From the Shadows, recounts speaking with Casey during this exact period. Gates directly quotes Casey saying 22 words, even more than the 19 words Woodward said Casey used with him.<ref></ref> The CIA's internal report found that Casey "had forty-three meetings or phone calls with Woodward, including a number of meetings at Casey's home with no one else present" during the period Woodward was researching his book.<ref></ref> Gates was also quoted saying, "When I saw him in the hospital, his speech was even more slurred than usual, but if you knew him well, you could make out a few words, enough to get sense of what he was saying."<ref></ref> Following Casey's death, President Ronald Reagan wrote: "Woodward's a liar and he lied about what Casey is supposed to have thought of me."<ref></ref>
Commentator David Frum has said that Washington officials can learn something about the way Washington works from Woodward's books: "From his books, you can draw a composite profile of the powerful Washington player. That person is highly circumspect, highly risk averse, eschews new ideas, flatters his colleagues to their face (while trashing them to Woodward behind their backs), and is always careful to avoid career-threatening confrontation. We all admire heroes, but Woodward's books teach us that those who rise to leadership are precisely those who take care to abjure heroism for themselves."<ref> urltoken Frum, David, "David Frum's Diary" blog, at the National Review Online Web site, October 5, 2006, post "Blogging Woodward"</ref>
Despite these criticisms and challenges, Woodward has been praised as an authoritative and balanced journalist. The New York Times Book Review said in 2004 that "No reporter has more talent for getting Washington's inside story and telling it cogently."<ref></ref>
==Lecture circuit==
As of 2008, Woodward was giving speeches on the "lecture circuit" to industry lobbying groups, such as the American Bankruptcy Institute, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, and the Mortgage Bankers Association.<ref></ref> Woodward was commanding speaking fees "ranging from $15,000 to $60,000" and donating them to his personal foundation, the Woodward Walsh Foundation, which donated to charities including Sidwell Friends School.<ref></ref> Washington Post policy prohibits "speaking engagements without permission from department heads" but Woodward insisted that the policy is "fuzzy and ambiguous".<ref></ref>
Woodward also lectures at colleges and universities. He gave the 2001 Robert C. Vance Distinguished Lecture at Central Connecticut State University,<ref>Fillo, Maryellen.

In his 1995 memoir, A Good Life, former Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee singled out Woodward in the foreword. "It would be hard to overestimate the contributions to my newspaper and to my time as editor of that extraordinary reporter, Bob Woodward—surely the best of his generation at investigative reporting, the best I've ever seen. And Woodward has maintained the same position on top of journalism's ladder ever since Watergate."<ref>Ben Bradlee, A Good Life, 1995, pp. 12–13, New York: Simon and Schuster, . See also pp. 324–384.</ref> In 1995, Woodward also received the Golden Plate Award of the Academy of Achievement.<ref></ref>
David Gergen, who had worked in the White House during the Richard Nixon and three subsequent administrations, said in his 2000 memoir, Eyewitness to Power, of Woodward's reporting, "I don't accept everything he writes as gospel—he can get details wrong—but generally, his accounts in both his books and in the Post are remarkably reliable and demand serious attention. I am convinced he writes only what he believes to be true or has been reliably told to be true. And he is certainly a force for keeping the government honest."<ref>David Gergen, Eyewitness to Power, 2000, p. 71, New York: Simon and Schuster, .</ref>
In 2001, Woodward won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism.<ref></ref>
Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard called Woodward "the best pure reporter of his generation, perhaps ever."<ref>Fred Barnes, "The White House at War," The Weekly Standard, December 12, 9002, urltoken In 2003, Albert Hunt of The Wall Street Journal called Woodward "the most celebrated journalist of our age." In 2004, Bob Schieffer of CBS News said, "Woodward has established himself as the best reporter of our time. He may be the best reporter of all time."<ref>Bob Schieffer, "The Best Reporter of All Time," CBS News, April 18, 2004, urltoken 
In 2014, Robert Gates former director of the CIA and Secretary of Defense, said that he wished he'd recruited Woodward into the CIA, saying, "He has an extraordinary ability to get otherwise responsible adults to spill their guts to him.his ability to get people to talk about stuff they shouldn't be talking about is just extraordinary and may be unique."<ref></ref>
