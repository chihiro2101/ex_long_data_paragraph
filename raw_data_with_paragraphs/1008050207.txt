Wardenclyffe Tower

== Post-Tesla era ==
In 1925, the property ownership was transferred to Walter L. Johnson of Brooklyn. On March 6, 1939, Plantacres, Inc. purchased the facility's land and subsequently leased it to Peerless Photo Products, Inc.
Agfa-Gevaert bought the property from Peerless and used the site from 1969 to 1992 before closing the facility. The site has undergone a final cleanup of waste produced during its Photo Products era. The clean up was conducted under the scrutiny of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, and paid for by AGFA.
In 2009, AGFA put the property up for sale for $1,650,000. The main building remains standing to this day; AGFA advertised that the land can "be delivered fully cleared and level." It says it spent $5 million through September 2008 cleaning up silver and cadmium.<ref name=bold></ref><ref name="nytimes.com"></ref><ref></ref> A non-profit preservation organization supported by The Oatmeal purchased the land in 2013 with hopes to create a museum to Tesla there.<ref name="teslasciencecenter.org"></ref>
=== Landmarking ===
On February 14, 1967, the nonprofit public benefit corporation Brookhaven Town Historical Trust was established. It selected the Wardenclyffe facility to be designated as a historic site and as the first site to be preserved by the Trust on March 3, 1967. The Brookhaven Town Historic Trust was rescinded by resolution on February 1, 1972. There were never any appointments made after a legal opinion was received; it was never set up properly.<ref>Email from Brookhaven Town Historian, Barbara Russell, Mon, March 30, 2009</ref> On July 7, 1976, a plaque from Yugoslavia was installed by representatives from Brookhaven National Laboratory<ref>Brookhaven Bulletin, Vol. 30 No. 27, July 16, 1976</ref> near the entrance of the building.&nbsp;It reads:<ref name="plaque"></ref>
The sign was stolen from the property in November 2009. An anonymous benefactor is offering a $2,000 reward if it is returned to the property.<ref></ref>
In 1976, an application was filed to nominate the main building for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). It failed to get approval. The Tesla Wardenclyffe Project, Inc. was established in 1994 for the purpose of seeking placement of the Wardenclyffe laboratory-office building and the Tesla tower foundation on both the New York State and NRHP. Its mission is the preservation and adaptive reuse of Wardenclyffe, the century-old laboratory of electrical pioneer Nikola Tesla located in Shoreham, Long Island, New York.<ref></ref>
In October 1994, a second application for formal nomination was filed. The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation conducted inspections and determined the facility meets New York State criteria for historic designation. A second visit was made on February 25, 2009. The site cannot be registered until it is nominated by a willing owner.
Designation of the structure as a National Landmark is awaiting completion of plant decommissioning activities by its present owner.<ref></ref>
=== Museum ===
In August 2012, concerned about an apparent offer to purchase the site and develop it for commercial use, web cartoon The Oatmeal launched a fundraiser for the Tesla Science Center to raise $1.7 million in order to purchase the property, with the hope of eventually building a museum on the grounds.<ref> urltoken "To Keep Tesla's Flame Bright, Fans Return to His Workshop", New York Times article, 2012-08-28</ref>
Jane Alcorn, president of the nonprofit group The Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe, and Matthew Inman, creator of The Oatmeal, collaborated in 2012 to honor "the Father of the Electric Age", by preserving the Wardenclyffe facility as a science center and museum. They initiated the Let's Build a Goddamn Tesla Museum fund-raising campaign on the Indiegogo crowdfunding site, to raise funding to buy the Wardenclyffe property and restore the facility. The project reached its goal of raising $850,000 within a week, more than exceeded the requested amount, including a $33,333 donation from the producers of the Tesla film "Fragments from Olympus-The Vision of Nikola Tesla".<ref></ref> The campaign also attracted donations from benefactors such as Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, Inc.<ref name=Frum></ref>
The money raised within one week was enough to get a matching grant from the state of New York, allowing the project to be able to meet the seller's asking price of $1.6&nbsp;million;<ref name=Frum /><ref name=Greenfieldboyce></ref> the state had agreed to match donations up to half that amount.<ref></ref> A total of $1.37 million was donated, the matching grant from the State of New York brings the total collected to over $2.2 million. The surplus will be used to fund the cleaning and restoration of the property. Tesla, Wardenclyffe and the museum fundraising effort will be the subject of a new documentary being produced called Tower to the People – Tesla's Dream at Wardenclyffe Continues.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
On May 2, 2013, The Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe announced that they had purchased the 15.69-acre laboratory site from Agfa-Gevaert and will begin to raise "about $10 million to create a science learning center and museum worthy of Tesla and his legacy."<ref name="teslasciencecenter.org"/>
On May 13, 2014, The Oatmeal published a comic called "What It's Like to Own a Model S, Part 2", in which they requested a further donation of $8 million from Tesla Motors founder Elon Musk in order to propel the museum toward completion.<ref></ref> The next day, Musk stated on Twitter that he "would be happy to help."<ref></ref> On July 10, 2014, during a 158th birthday celebration for Tesla at the Wardenclyffe site, it was announced that Musk would donate $1 million toward funding the museum, as well as having a Tesla Motors supercharging station installed onsite.<ref></ref>
The center plans to offer several programs, including science teacher associations, conferences, symposia, field trips, associations with science competitions, and other science programs. Planned permanent exhibits include a Tesla exhibit, exploratorium-type exhibits, and a living museum.<ref></ref> On September 23, 2013, the President of Serbia, Tomislav Nikolić, unveiled a monument to Tesla at the Wardenclyffe site. Nikolić said that he had planned to push for the monument to be displayed at the United Nations, but chose Wardenclyffe once he learned it had been purchased for the center.<ref></ref>
== Facility grounds ==
Wardenclyffe is located near the Shoreham Post Office and Shoreham Fire House on Route 25A in Shoreham, Long Island, New York. Wardenclyffe was divided into two main sections. The tower, which was located in the back, and the main building now compose the entire facility grounds. At one time the property was about . Now it consists of slightly less than .

in dollars. When Tesla was unable to make any further payments on the mortgages, Boldt foreclosed on the Wardenclyffe property.<ref name="books.google.com" /> Boldt failed to find any use for the property and finally decided to demolish the tower for scrap. On July 4, 1917 the Smiley Steel Company of New York began demolition of the tower by dynamite it. The tower was knocked on a tilt by the initial explosion but it took until September to totally demolish it.<ref name="teslauniverse.com"></ref><ref name="Margaret Cheney 2011, pages 218-219">Margaret Cheney, Tesla: Man Out of Time, Simon and Schuster – 2011, pages 218-219</ref> The scrap value realized was $1750.
Since this was during World War I a rumor spread, picked up by newspapers and other publications, that the tower was demolished on orders of the United States Government with claims German spies were using it as a radio transmitter or observation post, or that it was being used as a landmark for German submarines.<ref name="Margaret Cheney 2011, pages 218-219" /><ref name="demol">See urltoken U.S. Blows Up Tesla Radio Tower (page 293 of the September 1917 issue of The Electrical Experimenter): "Suspecting that German spies were using the big wireless tower erected at Shoreham, L.

George Boldt decided to make the property available for sale. On April 20, 1922, Tesla lost an appeal of judgment on Boldt's foreclosure. This effectively locked Tesla out of any future development of the facility.
