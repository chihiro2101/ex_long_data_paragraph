Music of Sudan

== Folk music and other traditional musical forms ==
=== Rural traditional music and dance ===
As in other African regions, the traditional musical styles of Sudan are ancient,<ref>Archaeologists of the British Museum found so-called rock gongs from prehistoric times, that are thought to have been used as instruments in social activities by civilizations that lived near the Nile. </ref> rich and diverse, with different regions and ethnic groups having many distinct musical traditions. Music of Africa has always been very important as an integral part of religious and social life of communities. Performances of songs, dance and instrumental music are used in rituals and social ceremonies like weddings, circumcision rites or to accompany the long camel treks of the Bedouins. In these performances, music always has been a social event, marked by the combination of performers, lyrics, music and the participation of the community, like dancing or other types of sharing a musical event. Traditional music and its performance have been handed down from generation to generation by accomplished musicians to younger generations and was not written down, except in recent times by formally trained musicians or Ethnomusicology.<ref>The University of Khartoum's Institute for African and Asian Studies has a Department for Musicology with a large collection of visual, sound and written material. urltoken his report on the Nubian musician Dahab from 1973, ethnomusicologist Artur Simon gives a detailed description of the social and artistic aspects of traditional Nubian music and the changes it had undergone through modern society. </ref> 
The music of Sudan has a strong tradition of lyrical expression that uses oblique metaphors, speaks about love, the history of a tribe or the beauty of the country. In his essay "Sudanese Singing 1908–1958", author El Sirr A. Gadour translated the lyrics of a love song from the beginning of the 20th century as follows:<ref name=":1"></ref>
One of the most typical East African instruments, called tanbūra,<ref></ref> or kissar in Nubian music, was traditionally played by the singers as the usual accompaniment for such songs, but this traditional Sudanese lyre has largely been replaced in the 20th century by the Arabic oud.<ref>Through his recordings for western labels, the late composer and oud player Hamza El Din became internationally known. He was, however of Southern Egyptian Nubian origin, and sang both in his native dialect of Sudanese Arabic as well as in the Nubian language.</ref> Drums, hand clapping and dancing are other important elements of traditional musical performances, as well as the use of other African instruments, like traditional xylophones, flutes or trumpets. One example for this are the elaborate wooden gourd trumpets, called al Waza,<ref></ref><ref></ref> played by the Berta people of the Blue Nile State. In contrast to Arabic music#Art music, most Sudanese music styles are pentatonic, and the simultaneous beats of percussion or singing in Polyrhythms are another of the most prominent characteristics of Sudanese Sub-Saharan music.<ref></ref> 
In many ethnic groups, distinguished women play an important role in the social celebration of a tribe's virtues and history. In her report about women singers in Darfur, the Ethnomusicology Roxane Connick Carlisle recounts her fieldwork during the 1960s in three ethnic groups.<ref></ref> She describes the common traits of these female bards from the Zaghawa,<ref>"Free vocal rhythm and simple meter throughout, undulating and generally descending solo melodies ranging within an octave, great importance given to meaningful text, a syllabic setting of text to tone level, and a generally relaxed and thoughtful performance of songs – these are the traits present in the repertories of Zaghawi female bards and non-specialist singers." Connick Carlisle, R. (1976), Women Singers in Darfur, Sudan Republic, p.259</ref> <ref>A modern Zagawa song is presented with translation and notes in the music video "Zagawa Girl". urltoken </ref> Fur and Beni Helba Baggara people as follows: 
Another traditional form of oral poetry are the songs of praise or Mockery by female singers of western Sudan, called Hakamat. These are women of high social standing, respected for their eloquence, intuition and decisiveness, who may both incite or vilify the men of their tribe, when engaged in feuds with other tribes.<ref></ref> The social impact of these Hakamat can be so strong, that they have recently been invited by peacebuilding initiatives in Darfur in order to exert their influence for conflict resolution or other social issues, like environmental protection.<ref></ref>
=== Dervishes and zikr rituals as religious forms of recitation and dance ===
The numerous brotherhoods of Sufi Dervishes are religious, mystical groups that use prayers, music and ritual dance to achieve an altered state of consciousness in a tradition called zikr. Like in other Islamic communities, the prominent Sufi orders of Sudan engage in ritualized zikr ceremonies that are not considered by the faithful as musical performances, but as a form of prayer. Each order or lineage within an order has one or more forms for zikr, the liturgy of which may include recitation, instrumental music, dance, costumes, incense, and is sometimes leading to ecstasy and trance.<ref>Habib Hassan Touma (1996).

== Brass bands and the origins of modern Sudanese music ==
From the early 1920s onwards, radio, records, film and later, television have contributed to the development of Sudanese popular music by introducing new instruments and styles. Already during the Turkish Sudan and later during the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan until independence, first Egyptian, and then British military bands left their mark, especially through the musical training of Sudanese soldiers and by introducing Western brass instruments. According to Sudanese social historian Ahmad Sikainga,<ref></ref> became well known in 2017. Their song African Girl<ref></ref> has scored more than 100,000 clicks on YouTube alone and earned them an invitation to the popular music show Arabs Got Talent in Beirut. After the band split up, their lead singer, composer and keyboard player Hiba Elgizouli<ref></ref> is pursuing her own career, also producing her own artistic music videos.<ref></ref>
Another musical example of Sudanese artists, celebrating the many faces and social roles of women in today's Sudan, is the popular music video Sudaniya (Sudanese woman) that claims more than 6 million viewers on YouTube.<ref></ref>
During the Sudanese Revolution of 2018/19, hip hop and other types of Urban contemporary were a means of important cultural and political expression for young people in Sudan and its diaspora.<ref></ref> A new trend in Sudanese music since the late 2000s is called Zanig and has become popular as a form of underground music through live shows and sound systems on public transport.<ref></ref> It was described in the following way by journalist and fellow of the Rift Valley Institute Magdi el Gizouli:<blockquote>"This bootleg Music genre, pioneered by the King Ayman al-Rubo, is a fusion of West African beats and Egyptian Mahraganat style, with frequent accelerations and deceleration and techno-style repetition. Zanig queens sing about ‘antibaby pills’ and the agency of ‘MILF’ and introduce themselves with maxims like: ‘If you follow the sugar mummies you’ll end up driving six cars, and if you follow the little buds you’ll waste your money in restaurants’."<ref></ref></blockquote>

The rich and varied music of Sudan is made up of traditional, rural East African roots,<ref></ref> as well as of Arabic, Western or other African influences on the popular urban music from the early 20th century onwards. Since the establishment of big cities like Khartoum as melting pots for people of diverse backgrounds, their cultural heritage and tastes have shaped numerous forms of modern popular music. In the Globalization of today, the creation and consumption of music through satellite TV or on the Internet is a driving force for cultural change in Sudan, popular with local audiences as well as with Sudanese living abroad.
Even after the secession of South Sudan in 2011, the Sudan of today is very diverse, with Sudan#Ethnic groups spread across the country's territory, which makes it the third largest country in Africa. The cultures of its ethnic and social groups have been marked by the complex cultural legacy, going back to the spread of Islam as well as by indigenous African cultural heritage. Though some of the ethnic groups still maintain their Indigenous language, most Sudanese today speak the distinct Sudanese Arabic.
Due to its geographic location in East Africa, where African, Arabic, Christian and Islamic cultures have shaped people's identities, and on the southern belt of the Sahel region, Sudan has been a cultural crossroads between North, East and West Africa, as well as the Arabian Peninsula, for hundreds of years. Thus, it has a rich and very diverse musical culture, ranging from traditional folk music to Sudanese popular urban music of the 20th century and up to the internationally influenced African pop music of today. Despite religious and cultural objections towards music and dance in public life, musical traditions have always enjoyed great popularity with most Sudanese. Even during times of wide-ranging restrictions of public life, public concerts or the celebration of weddings and other social events, music and dance have always been part of cultural life in Sudan.
