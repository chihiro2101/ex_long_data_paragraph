Christian music industry

==History==
The contemporary Christian music industry has roots in the late 1960s and early 1970s Jesus movement and its Jesus music artists. The Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music points out three reasons that the Christian music industry developed as a parallel structure to the general music industry.<ref name="Powell_Fe_intro"></ref> First, the Jesus movement produced a large number of bands in a very short period, which the general market was unable and/or unwilling to absorb.<ref name="Powell_Fe_intro"/> This was in part due to a lack of appreciation for the ideology expressed by such artists.<ref name="Powell_Fe_intro"/> Finally, Jesus music artists tended toward mistrust of secular corporations.<ref name="Powell_Fe_intro"/> According to another critic, the industry in this period was defined by four characteristics: lack of audience acceptance for styles, inferior production, inefficient distribution, and lack of wide radio exposure.<ref name="RPCinA"/> Petra, for instance, struggled to find an audience for their hard rock sound, partially due to limited distribution to Christian bookstores.<ref name="Cusic_PART4"></ref>
Even so, the 1970s saw established corporations become involved in the Christian music market. Word Records, founded in 1951, was bought in 1976 by ABC.<ref name="Mount_Web"></ref> Other music industry giants also got involved, CBS started a short-lived Christian label, Priority Records, and MCA also fielded a label, Songbird Records, for a time.
While the Jesus movement had ended by the 1980s, the Christian music industry was maturing and transforming into a multimillion-dollar enterprise. The early 1980s saw an increase Christian booksellers taking product, and an increase in sales followed, despite the recession.<ref name="Cusic_PART4"/> As a percentage of gross sales, Christian music rose from 9% in 1976 to 23% in 1985.<ref name="Cusic_PART4"/> By Age to Age Amy Grant had saturated the Christian marketplace and made significant inroads into the general market.<ref name="Cusic_PART4"/> Sandi Patti and Michael W. Smith also gained influence within Christian music, each playing significant roles in the development of the industry.<ref name="Cusic_PART4"/>
Harder forms of Christian music, such as metal music, also began to gain acceptance. This is largely credited to Stryper, who had begun making inroads into the general market by 1985.<ref name="Hale_93"></ref> Still, rock and alternative acts faced a longer battle for acceptance than contemporary acts, as the form was opposed by prominent religious leaders such as Jimmy Swaggart and others on the Christian right.<ref name="CCM_28_5"></ref><ref name="DTT_CROCK"></ref> While in 1981 total gospel music industry revenues were approximately $180&nbsp;million, only ten years later they would total $680&nbsp;million, according to CCM Magazine.<ref name="CCM_14_6"></ref>
</ref> and 1972's Only Visiting This Planet became one of the most revered albums of all time in Christian music. Even so, Norman became, according to CCM "so far outside the mainstream that most of today's Christian music fans have no idea who Larry Norman is."<ref name="CCM_30_9_LN"></ref>
The problem, as summed by one critic, was that the music was too religious for secular audience, while simultaneously too aggressive for religious audiences.<ref name="JMIA"/><ref name="AoR1999"/> One critic describes the situation, stating that for a band "to be taken seriously outside the Christian scene, a band must stay far, far away from that scene."<ref name="CTTY_06_06"></ref>
Mutemath, for instance sued their record label with the goal of removing their product from the Christian market. Their first release sold almost 30,000 copies, with "bulk of sales coming from the Christian market," according to Billboard.<ref name="BB_118_10"></ref> The band had been placed in the Christian market by their record label largely because their lead singer, Paul Meany, was previously with the band Earthsuit, whose Kaleidoscope Superior was released on Sparrow Records.
This caused the band to not get taken seriously by music critics, and by the release of Mutemath (album) the band began expressing discontent with their situation.<ref name="TW_Mutemath"></ref> Meany told Tucson Weekly ".we began to see ourselves getting pigeonholed into this particular world that we weren't necessarily proud to be associated with. We're not trying to preach through our music; we don't have some kind of evangelistic agenda with what we're doing. You know, you don't want to be ashamed of your faith and your beliefs, but you don't want to be marketed by that, either."<ref name="TW_Mutemath"/>
On the other hand, some artists operate solely within the "ghetto" of Christian music, and find great success in doing so.
===Downplayed religious content===
An early Christian record label, Lamb & Lion Records (founded by Pat Boone) reported in 1978 that it was their goal to produce crossover artists, but they were limited by lack of distribution to the secular marketplace.<ref name="ET_29_5"></ref> Both problems affected Christian labels into the 1990s.<ref name="JoAC_15_3"/> "Since people don't understand the term 'Blood of Christ, '" stated a manager for Lamb & Lion, ".music that communicates must approach it another way. We've got to present a subtle but sensitive Christian message."<ref name="ET_29_5"/> Lyrics with subdued religious content have become commonplace in the industry; One critic points out that the secular hit "Spirit in the Sky" "has more explicit religious references than do many recent Christian radio hits."<ref name="BILLBOARD_G_HIST"></ref>
Some critics have alleged that CCM often uses "minimal direct theology," and promotes a "Jesus is my boyfriend" image of God.<ref name="Cusic_PART4"/> Using downplayed religious content in lyrics has allowed some artists to "cross over" and make significant impact into the general market. Some Christian bands are able to do this while maintaining their identity in the Christian market. For example, MercyMe, whose double platinum album Almost There produced the Christian and secular chart hit "I Can Only Imagine." However, the lyrics of the single, while Christian in nature, contain what one critic calls "rather vacuous theology."<ref name="JMIA"/>
Sometimes "crossing over" creates ambiguity over whether an artist is Christian (a "Christian band"),<ref name="AoR1999"/> or the artist is composed of Christians and produces music that appeals to Christian music fans but doesn't cater to the Christian market ("Christians in a band").<ref name="AoR1999"/> Such artists are:
*Chevelle, whose Point No. 1 was released to Christian music markets, received three Dove awards.<ref name="DOVE_CHV1"></ref><ref name="DOVE_CHV2"></ref> However, the band is not generally considered to be a "Christian band" today. On that topic the band states "We originally signed with a record company that was backed by Word (a Christian label housing John Tesh and Amy Grant), so the record was in Christian bookstores. It was really an accidental thing."
*Project 86 has sometimes been labeled a "Christian band", although the band itself eschewed the label. The band considers its art to be the best conveyance of their message.<ref name="CM_Vol_52"></ref> Frontman Andrew Schwab has offered several statements on the topic. "We're not going to go in there and say 'Hey we're the Christian band. We're going to carry ourselves like a normal band. Hopefully people will like our music and investigate into the band . and they will learn our beliefs."<ref></ref> "If we're playing at Ozzfest or on Family Values.," the band told 7ball after the release of their second album, "there is a greater level of tact necessary in order to reach that sort of audience."<ref name="7b_30"></ref> In a 2007 interview, Schwab further opined "We always tell people that the goal has been to just write music that we love, and write music hopefully that is challenging and inspiring to people and doesn't sound like everything else out there."<ref name = "DIBASE_2007-04-23"></ref>
*Switchfoot is often referred to as a "Christian band", mostly due to their involvement with the Christian rock scene in their early days. But the band has always shunned this label: "For us, it's a faith, not a genre,." says Jon Foreman. ".these songs are for everyone. Calling us 'Christian rock' tends to be a box that closes some people out and excludes them. And that's not what we're trying to do. Music has always opened my mindâ€”and that's what we want".<ref></ref> Duly, Foreman's lyrics steer clear of preachiness, exclusive declarations of faith, or even any mention of Jesus, instead Social commentary, probing existential issues through "Socratic dialogue"<ref></ref> in which he answers questions with more questions, exploring frustrations, or simply being inspirational. Even so, this position has not alienated their Christian fans. As in their indie days, they are still distributed to Christian retail outlets through Sparrow Records, featured on Christian radio and charts, and presented Dove Awards, even after having been signed to the mainstream Columbia Records. Spin writer Andrew Beaujon takes the view that "their lyrics often have two different meanings, one meaning for a Christian audience and one meaning for the rest of us. They try to relate to two different groups of people at once".<ref></ref>
====In video====
The trend continues when examining religious videos. Many Christian bands produce videos with rotation on MTV in mind, however, the images can lead to an ambiguous impression of the portrayal.
In 1982 MTV featured two videos, "Constantly Changing" and "It's Mad" (which was the first one to be featured), made by the Swedish Christian rock band Jerusalem to promote their 1981 release Warrior.<ref name="MuLe_2_9"></ref> DeGarmo and Key was the first Christian band in the US whose video appeared on MTV, made a video for their single "Six, Six, Six" off their 1984 release Communication. While the video was shown on MTV for a short time, it was subsequently pulled for a scene which depicted the Antichrist engulfed in flames, which MTV described as "senseless violence."<ref name=autogenerated1></ref> Eventually the video was re-edited for MTVâ€”however, the unedited version continued to play in Christian bookstores and on Christian television networks, like Trinity Broadcasting.<ref name="MuLe_3_1"></ref> The video received a Dove award in a category created specially for it, "Gospel Music Visual Song" in 1985.<ref name="MuLe_3_1"/>
Another artist, Brian Welch, whose solo debut was released to Christian markets, found their album pulled from some Christian bookstores after the music video for "Flush" was released.<ref name="BrianW"/> The video is an interpretation of the authors personal experience with methamphetamine, before his religious conversion. At the time the album was pulled, Brian Welsh released a statement about the visual content of the video, relating its symbolism to his personal experiences of addiction and redemption. He also issued the following statement: "The video for 'Flush' is about crystal meth addiction and the crazy things anyone addicted to meth will do while they're high or to get their fix. Everything the models were doing in the video is what I was wrapped up in while I was addicted to meth. I believe I would be dead right now if I continued using meth, but instead, I chose to surrender my life to Christ and die to myself so He could share His resurrection with me. There is a huge message of hope on my CD and I believe those retailers that are pulling the CD from their shelves are robbing someone spiritually by taking it off of the shelves."<ref name="BrianW"></ref>
A study of visual elements of Christian music videos on Z Music Television, a now defunct MTV-like channel for Christian music, found that almost one third of the channel's videos could be described as "Ambiguously Religious" at best (red area, right).<ref name="PMS_S99"/> The conclusion was that the channel's programming was designed to make its Christian nature "apparent only to those willing to listen for it."<ref name="PMS_S99"></ref>
===Other arguments===
Some critics describe the Christian music industry as being committed "to the goals and strategies of the commercial marketplace â€“ industrial growth, increased market share, and greater profits."<ref name="RPCinA"></ref> This became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s as the largest Christian record labels became subsidiaries of the "mainstream" labels (who are themselves owned by huge media conglomerates like Viacom and Time Warner).<ref name="AoR1999"></ref><ref name="Hendershot2002"/> Others see the industry as taking on the roles traditionally reserved for the church. Concerts are the equivalent of religious services, and commodities symbols of faith.<ref name="RPCinA_art"></ref> Under these conditions "evangelism becomes rhetoricâ€”justifying the propaganda value of the industry's work â€“ not spiritual reality."<ref name="RPCinA_art"/> One critic comments that "perhaps the 'ghettoization' and parallel institutionalism of CCM manifests itself nowhere more apparently than at numerous Christian rock festivals."<ref name="JMIA"></ref>

The Christian music industry is a small part of the larger music industry, that focuses on traditional Gospel music, Southern gospel, contemporary Christian music, and alternative Christian music. It is sometimes called the gospel music industry, although this designation is not a limitation on the musical styles represented.
Christian artists generally use secular styles, pairing them with lyrics that display faith and spirituality to varying degrees. Generally speaking, the industry is influenced by mainstream culture. Musical trends, for instance, follow those of the secular scene, though usually a few years behind.<ref name="Powell_Fe_dct"> Quote: "Of course the Christian market was a few years behind the rest of the world. it always is." original emphasis</ref><ref name="CCM_20_1_CS"></ref><ref name="RPCinA"/> The Christian music industry carries the distinction of being the only music subculture whose content is labeled by its lyrical dimension rather than its music. Still, music within the industry is sold by its musical style rather than lyrical content.
Christian music's critics point to the divergent interests of commercialization and ministry, which have, according to some, polar opposite goals. Aspects of Christian music have long struggled to gain general acceptance, even within the Christian community. What some see as secularization and a lacking of direct theology, others see as artistic ministry. This opens up questions of the definition of "Christian music" that have lingered over the industry since its inception.
The Christian music industry experienced tremendous growth in the 1990s. Christian music sales grew to exceed those for classical, jazz, and new age music.<ref name="GMA_OV_08"></ref> Even so, the Christian music industry has experienced the same issues as the general market in recent years.
