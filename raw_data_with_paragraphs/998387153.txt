===Governors===
There should be a table for provincial governors similar to what has been for Brazil for example. In addition the table if possible should also be found under the article for each governor there is a page for. See Brazilian governors Ana Julia Carepa or Jose Serra for examples.
== Naming conventions ==
=== Origins ===
for discussion We should discuss first the origins of the word and the concept of an LGU. The term was brought about by a 1991 law, the local government code, authored by Senator Aquilino Pimentel, which tries to this day to devolve the functions of central government agencies to--and now comes the term--local government units. 
=== Regions ===
All region articles should be titled with the region's long name (as given by the Philippine Standard Geographic Code (PSGC) of the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB)) instead of the common Region X, with the exception of the National Capital Region and Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao which are titled Metro Manila and Bangsamoro, respectively.
=== Provinces ===
These should be titled with their base name such as Rizal and Batangas. Exceptions:
# Abra (province) since Abra has other meanings
# Antique (province) since antique is a common term.
# Aurora (province) since Aurora is a common term.
# Cotabato (province). Cotabato by itself most often refers to Cotabato City instead of the province previously named North Cotabato.
# Isabela (province). There are other places with the same name.
# Laguna (province) since Laguna has many other meanings.
# Leyte (province). Leyte by itself most oftern refers to Leyte (island) instead of the province
# Samar (province). Samar by itself most often refers to Samar (island) instead of the province previously named Western Samar.
=== Cities ===
for discussion Should all cities have their names appended with a 'City'? Which is better: Laoag, Laoag City, or City of Laoag? (Some cities seemed to be officially named "City of .". What about unusual city names like Science City of Mu&ntilde;oz and Island Garden City of Samal.
:In my Personal opinion, the official name of the city must be followed although some cities may be names ____________city, or City of ____________. The official will be what is on the city logo. Justox dizaola 10:05, 6 May 2006 (UTC)
::WP is not required to follow official names. Compare City of the Village of Clarkston and City of New York. see also WP:NC:CITY Tobias Conradi (Talk) 14:54, 19 August 2006 (UTC)
:::_____ City is fine. --<b><font color="orange">User:Howard the Duck <font color="#FFA500">the</font> User talk:Howard the Duck</font></b> 12:36, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
=== Municipalities ===
for discussion All municipality articles would be titled with their name followed by their province. E.g. Alaminos, Laguna. Some exceptions might probably be municipalities that are very notable apart from their province (like Puerto Galera in Oriental Mindoro).
: True but it may be better without exceptions para official name will be used. Justox dizaola 10:08, 6 May 2006 (UTC)
=== Barangays ===
*X, Y, Z like in San Guillermo, Morong, Rizal
**this may be the shortest method and integrates well with municipality naming.
***IMHO, barangays aren't that notable. Do you expect a student from Kirkland, Washington researching about a single barangay? --<b><font color="orange">User:Howard the Duck <font color="#FFA500">the</font> User talk:Howard the Duck</font></b> 08:27, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
****IMHO, some barangays are notable enough to be included in Wikipedia. I wonder why a character from Encantadia can be included here and not barangays. --Bentong Isles 12:25, 16 May 2007 (UTC)
=== Other concerns ===
for discussion What about places named after female saints? Do we use Sta. Cruz, Laguna or Santa Cruz, Laguna?
: It must depend on what is written on most official seals, for my opinion. Justox dizaola 10:09, 6 May 2006 (UTC)
:: yes, we must follow the official name used by the concerned municipality. for example, santa ana urltoken and santa praxedes urltoken towns in cagayan both use "santa" but another town, and sta. teresita urltoken use "sta." instead (although in the wikipedia article, "santa" is used). --Saluyot 01:33, 29 June 2006 (UTC)
:::who is we? WP is not required to follow official names. Compare City of the Village of Clarkston and City of New York. Full form for all is a policy also applied in other places around the world. No need to re-invent the wheel for PH. Tobias Conradi (Talk) 14:19, 19 August 2006 (UTC)
::::This makes no sense. The question was whether to use "Sta." or "Santa", not the official name, or else it wll be the "City of Vigan", etc. what Saluyot was trying to say was to use what spelling is on the official seal. --<b><font color="orange">User:Howard the Duck <font color="#FFA500">the</font> User talk:Howard the Duck</font></b> 02:23, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
There is no norm in naming towns except either using the official name or the way like it to write like 'santa' or 'sta'. This is because even official records do not intend to follow or initiate seriously how a town named after saints or persons which begins with a title should be written in official documents.
==Province Template==
The template is located on a separate page for easy copying. See Benguet for an excellent example of the template in action (though yet incomplete).
