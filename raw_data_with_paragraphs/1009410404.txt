Sexual harassment

==Etymology and history==
The modern legal understanding of sexual harassment was first developed in the 1970s, although related concepts have existed in many cultures.
=== The term "sexual harassment" ===
Although legal activist Catharine MacKinnon is sometimes credited with creating the laws surrounding sexual harassment in the United States with her 1979 book entitled Sexual Harassment of Working Women,<ref name=":8" /> she did not coin the term. The phrase appeared in print in a 1972 issue of The Globe and Mail newspaper published in Toronto.<ref>Hugh Gardner, ".and every prisoner an unprintable word," The Globe and Mail, 18 March 1972, p. 35. Source: ProQuest Historical Newspapers digital archive.</ref> An early use of the term was in a 1973 report about discrimination called "Saturn's Rings" by Mary Rowe, Ph.D.<ref></ref> At the time, Rowe was the Chancellor for Women and Work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).<ref>Rowe, Mary, "Saturn's Rings," a study of the minutiae of sexism which maintain discrimination and inhibit affirmative action results in corporations and non-profit institutions; published in Graduate and Professional Education of Women, American Association of University Women, 1974, pp.&nbsp;1–9. "Saturn's Rings II" is a 1975 updating of the original, with racist and sexist incidents from 1974 and 1975. Revised and republished as "The Minutiae of Discrimination: The Need for Support," in Forisha, Barbara and Barbara Goldman, Outsiders on the Inside, Women in Organizations, Prentice-Hall, Inc., New Jersey, 1981, Ch. 11, pp.&nbsp;155–171. .</ref> Due to her efforts at MIT, the university was one of the first large organizations in the U.S. to develop specific policies and procedures aimed at stopping sexual harassment.
Rowe says that harassment of women in the workplace was being discussed in women's groups in Massachusetts in the early 1970s. At Cornell University, instructor Lin Farley discovered that women in a discussion group repeatedly described being fired or quitting a job because they were harassed and intimidated by men.<ref name = "ss"></ref> She coined the term "sexual harassment" to describe the problem, and described it at length in 1975 testimony before the New York City Human Rights Commission.<ref>"Testimony given by Lin Farley", Hearings on women in blue-collar, service, and clerical occupations|publisher=Commission on Human Rights of the City of New York, April 21, 1975</ref><ref></ref> In the book In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution (1999), journalist Susan Brownmiller says the women at Cornell became public activists after being asked for help by Carmita Dickerson Wood, a 44-year-old single mother who was being harassed by a faculty member at Cornell's Department of Nuclear Physics.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> Farley wrote a book, Sexual Shakedown: The Sexual Harassment of Women on the Job, published by McGraw-Hill in 1978 and in a paperback version by Warner Books in 1980.<ref name = "ss"/>
These activists, Lin Farley, Susan Meyer, and Karen Sauvigne went on to form Working Women United which, along with the Alliance Against Sexual Coercion (founded in 1976 by Freada Klein, Lynn Wehrli, and Elizabeth Cohn-Stuntz), were among the pioneer organizations to bring sexual harassment to public attention in the late 1970s. One of the first legal formulations of the concept of sexual harassment as consistent with sex discrimination and therefore prohibited behavior under Civil Rights Act of 1964 appeared in the 1979 seminal book by Catharine MacKinnon<ref name=":8"></ref> entitled "Sexual Harassment of Working Women".<ref></ref>
=== Key sexual harassment cases ===
Sexual harassment first became codified in U.S. law as the result of a series of sexual harassment cases in the 1970s and 1980s. Many of the early women pursuing these cases were African American, often former civil rights activists who applied principles of civil rights to sex discrimination.<ref name=":1"></ref>
Williams v. Saxbe (1976) and Paulette L. Barnes, Appellant, v. Douglas M. Costle, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (1977) determined it was sex discrimination to fire someone for refusing a supervisor's advances.<ref name=":1" /><ref></ref> Around the same time, Bundy v. Jackson was the first federal appeals court case to hold that workplace sexual harassment was employment discrimination.<ref></ref> Five years later the Supreme Court agreed with this holding in Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson. Another pioneering legal case was Alexander v. Yale, which established that the sexual harassment of female students could be considered sex discrimination under Title IX, and was thus illegal.
The term was largely unknown (outside academic and legal circles) until the early 1990s when Anita Hill witnessed and testified against Supreme Court of the United States nominee Clarence Thomas.<ref name="techrep">Bowers, Toni; Hook, Brian. urltoken Hostile work environment: A manager's legal liability , Tech Republic. October 22, 2002. Retrieved on March 3, 2012.</ref> Since Hill testified in 1991, the number of sexual harassment cases reported in the United States and Canada increased 58 percent and have climbed steadily.<ref name="techrep" />
==Situations==
Sexual harassment may occur in a variety of circumstances and in places as varied as factories, schools, colleges, the theater, and the music business.<ref></ref><ref name="Sexual harassment 1"></ref><ref name="Sexual harassment 2"></ref><ref name="sexual harssment 3"></ref><ref name="Sexual Harassment 4"></ref><ref name="review of Chuck Philips women in music article"></ref><ref name="Philips uncovers sexual harassment in the music business"></ref> Often, the perpetrator has or is about to have power or authority over the victim (owing to differences in social, political, educational or employment relationships as well as in age). Harassment relationships are specified in many ways:
* The perpetrator can be anyone, such as a client, a co-worker, a parent or legal guardian, relative, a teacher or professor, a student, a friend, or a stranger.
* Harassment can occur in varying locations, in schools,<ref></ref> colleges, workplaces, in public, and in other places.
* Harassment can occur whether or not there are witnesses to it.
* The perpetrator may be completely unaware that his or her behavior is offensive or constitutes sexual harassment. The perpetrator may be completely unaware that his or her actions could be unlawful.<ref name="eeoc"/>
* Incidents of harassment can take place in situations in which the targeted person may not be aware of or understand what is happening.
* An incident may be a one-time occurrence.
* Adverse effects on harassed persons include stress, social withdrawal, sleep disorders, eating difficulties, and other impairments of health.
* The victim and perpetrator can be any gender.
* The perpetrator does not have to be of the opposite sex.
* The incident may arise from misunderstanding by the perpetrator and/or the victim. These misunderstandings can be reasonable or unreasonable.
With the advent of the internet, social interactions, including sexual harassment, increasingly occur online, for example in video games or in chat rooms.
According to the 2014 PEW research statistics on online harassment, 25% of women and 13% of men between the ages of 18 and 24 have experienced sexual harassment while online.<ref></ref>
== In the workplace ==
The United States' Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) defines workplace sexual harassment as "unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature . . . when this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment” (EEOC).<ref name=":7"></ref>
Throughout the United States workplace, 79% of sexual harassment victims are women, and 21% are men. Out of those numbers, 51% of those people were harassed by a supervisor. Though sexual harassment happens in not all, but most professions, business, trade, banking, and finance are the biggest industries where sexual harassment occurs. Twelve per cent of the victims received threats of termination if they did not comply with their predators' request.
===Armed forces===
In 2018, an estimated 20,500 people in the US armed forces (about 13,000 women and 7,500 men) were assaulted, up from 14,900 in 2016.<ref></ref> Three hundred and two of the 2,558 cases were pursued by victims were prosecuted. Out of the 2,558 cases, 38% were committed by someone of higher rank.
== In the military ==
Studies of sexual harassment have found that it is markedly more common in the military than in civilian settings.<ref name=":12"></ref><ref name=":0"></ref> A Canadian study found that key risk factors associated with military settings are the typically young age of personnel, the 'isolated and integrated' nature of accommodation, the minority status of women, and the disproportionate number of men in senior positions.<ref name=":32"></ref> The Masculinity values and behaviours that are rewarded and reinforced in military settings, as well as their emphasis on conformity and obedience, are also thought to play a role.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref name=":5" /> Canadian research has also found that the risk increases during deployment on military operations.<ref name=":3"></ref>
While some male military personnel are sexually harassed, women are substantially more likely to be affected.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":92"></ref><ref name=":11"></ref> Women who are younger and joined the military at a younger age face a greater risk, according to American, British and French research.<ref></ref><ref name=":22"></ref><ref name=":72"></ref>
Child recruits (under the age of 18) and children in cadet forces also face an elevated risk. In the UK, for example, hundreds of complaints of the sexual abuse of cadets have been recorded since 2012.<ref name=":14"></ref><ref name=":15"></ref><ref name=":16"></ref> In Canada, one in ten complaints of sexual assault in military settings are from child cadets or their parents.<ref name=":14" /><ref name=":15" /><ref name=":16" /><ref></ref><ref name=":17"></ref>
Individuals detained by the military are also vulnerable to sexual harassment. During the Iraq War, for example, personnel of the US army and Central Intelligence Agency committed a number of human rights violations against detainees in the Abu Ghraib prison,<ref></ref> including rape, sodomy, and other forms of sexual abuse.<ref name="New Yorker 2004-05-17"></ref><ref name="Benjamin2009"></ref><ref name="hersh2007"></ref>
Although the risk of sexual misconduct in the armed forces is widely acknowledged, personnel are frequently reluctant to report incidents, typically out of fear of reprisals, according to research in Australia, Canada, France, the UK, and the US.<ref name=":12"/><ref name=":5"></ref><ref name=":92"/><ref name=":22"/><ref name=":72"/><ref name=":02"></ref><ref></ref>
Women affected by sexual harassment are more likely than other women to suffer stress-related mental illness afterwards.<ref name=":32"/> Research in the US found that when sexual abuse of female military personnel is Psychological trauma, the odds of suffering from Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after deployment on operations increase by a factor of nine.<ref name=":0" />
==Varied behaviors==
One of the difficulties in understanding sexual harassment is that it involves a range of behaviors. In most cases (although not in all cases) it is difficult for the victim to describe what they experienced. This can be related to difficulty classifying the situation or could be related to stress and humiliation experienced by the recipient. Moreover, behavior and motives vary between individual cases.<ref></ref>
Author Martha Langelan describes four different classes of harassers.<ref>Langelan, Martha. urltoken Back Off: How to Confront and Stop Sexual Harassment and Harassers . Fireside, 1993. .</ref>
* A predatory harasser: a person who gets sexual thrills from humiliating others. This harasser may become involved in sexual extortion, and may frequently harass just to see how targets respond. Those who don't resist may even become targets for rape.
* A dominance harasser: the most common type, who engages in harassing behavior as an ego boost.
* Strategic or territorial harassers who seek to maintain privilege in jobs or physical locations, for example a man's harassment of a female employee in a predominantly male occupation.
* A street harasser: Another type of sexual harassment performed in public places by strangers. Street harassment includes verbal and nonverbal behavior, remarks that are frequently sexual in nature and comment on physical appearance or a person's presence in public.<ref></ref>
== Prevention ==
Sexual harassment and assault may be prevented by secondary school,<ref></ref> college,<ref name=Foubert></ref><ref></ref> and workplace education programs.<ref></ref> At least one program for fraternity men produced "sustained behavioral change".<ref name=Foubert /><ref></ref>
Many sororities and fraternities in the United States take preventive measures against hazing and hazing activities during the participants' pledging processes (which may often include sexual harassment). Many Greek organizations and universities nationwide have anti-hazing policies that explicitly recognize various acts and examples of hazing, and offer preventive measures for such situations.<ref> urltoken Pualwan, CEO Emily N. HazingPrevention.org. Retrieved September 29, 2018.</ref>
Anti-sexual harassment training programs have little evidence of effectiveness and "Some studies&nbsp;suggest that training may in fact backfire, reinforcing gendered stereotypes that place women at a disadvantage".<ref> the prohibition of sex discrimination covers men and women. This discrimination occurs when the sex of the worker is made as a condition of employment (i.e. all female waitpersons or male carpenters) or where this is a job requirement that does not mention sex but ends up preventing many more persons of one sex than the other from the job (such as height and weight limits). This act only applies to employers with 15 or more employees.<ref name=":7" />
Barnes v. Train (1974) is commonly viewed as the first sexual harassment case in America, even though the term "sexual harassment" was not used.<ref></ref> In 1976, Williams v. Saxbe established sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination when sexual advances by a male supervisor towards a female employee, if proven, would be deemed an artificial barrier to employment placed before one gender and not another. In 1980 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued regulations defining sexual harassment and stating it was a form of sex discrimination prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In the 1986 case of Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, the Supreme Court first recognized "sexual harassment" as a violation of Title VII, established the standards for analyzing whether the conduct was welcome and levels of employer liability, and that speech or conduct in itself can create a "hostile environment".<ref></ref> This case filed by Mechelle Vinson ruled that the sexual conduct between the subordinate and supervisor could not be deemed voluntary due to the hierarchical relationship between the two positions in the workplace.<ref></ref> Following the ruling in Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, reported sexual harassment cases grew from 10 cases being registered by the EEOC per year before 1986 to 624 case being reported in the subsequent following year.<ref name=":6"></ref> This number of reported cases to the EEOC rose to 2,217 in 1990 and then 4,626 by 1995.<ref name=":6" />
The Civil Rights Act of 1991 added provisions to Title VII protections including expanding the rights of women to sue and collect compensatory and punitive damages for sexual discrimination or harassment, and the case of Ellison v. Brady (US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit – 924 F.2d 872 (9th Cir. 1991)) resulted in rejecting the reasonable person standard in favor of the "reasonable woman standard" which allowed for cases to be analyzed from the perspective of the complainant and not the defendant.<ref></ref> However, some legal scholars have argued this does not go far enough and that the reasonable person standard also needs to take intersectionality into account.<ref></ref> Also in 1991, Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co. became the first sexual harassment case to be given class action status paving the way for others. Seven years later, in 1998, through that same case, new precedents were established that increased the limits on the "discovery" process in sexual harassment cases, that then allowed psychological injuries from the litigation process to be included in assessing damages awards. In the same year, the courts concluded in Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, Florida, and Burlington v. Ellerth, that employers are liable for harassment by their employees.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Moreover, Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services set the precedent for same-sex harassment, and sexual harassment without motivation of "sexual desire", stating that any discrimination based on sex is actionable so long as it places the victim in an objectively disadvantageous working condition, regardless of the gender of either the victim, or the harasser.
In the 2006 case of Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, the standard for retaliation against a sexual harassment complainant was revised to include any adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely to dissuade a "reasonable worker" from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.
During 2007 alone, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and related state agencies received 12,510 new charges of sexual harassment on the job.<ref></ref> In Astra USA v. Bildman, 914 N.E.2d 36 (Mass. 2009), applying New York's faithless servant doctrine, the court held that a company's employee who had engaged in financial misdeeds and sexual harassment must "forfeit all of his salary and bonuses for the period of disloyalty."<ref name="auto6x"></ref> The court held that this was the case even if the employee "otherwise performed valuable services," and that the employee was not entitled to recover restitution for the value of those other services.<ref name="auto6x" /><ref></ref>
The 2010 case, Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ruled that a hostile work environment can be created in a workplace where sexually explicit language and pornography are present. A hostile workplace may exist even if it is not targeted at any particular employee.<ref></ref>
From 2010 through 2016, approximately 17% of sexual harassment complaints filed with the EEOC were made by men.<ref></ref>
=====Education=====
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (United States) states "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."
In Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools (1992), the U.S. Supreme Court held that private citizens could collect damage awards when teachers sexually harassed their students.<ref></ref> In Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser (1986) the courts ruled that schools have the power to discipline students if they use "obscene, profane language or gestures" which could be viewed as substantially interfering with the educational process, and inconsistent with the "fundamental values of public school education."<ref></ref> Under regulations issued in 1997 by the U.S. Department of Education, which administers Title IX, school districts should be held responsible for harassment by educators if the harasser "was aided in carrying out the sexual harassment of students by his or her position of authority with the institution."<ref></ref> In Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, and Murrell v. School Dist. No. 1, 1999, schools were assigned liability for peer-to-peer sexual harassment if the plaintiff sufficiently demonstrated that the administration's response shows "deliberate indifference" to "actual knowledge" of discrimination.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
====Additionally====
There are a number of legal options for a complainant in the U.S.: mediation, filing with the EEOC or filing a claim under a state Fair Employment Practices (FEP) statute (both are for workplace sexual harassment), filing a common law tort, etc.<ref name="whattodo"></ref> Not all sexual harassment will be considered severe enough to form the basis for a legal claim. However, most often there are several types of harassing behaviors present, and there is no minimum level for harassing conduct under the law.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The section below "EEOC Definition" describes the legal definitions that have been created for sexual harassment in the workplace. Definitions similar to the EEOC definition have been created for academic environments in the U.S. Department of Education Sexual Harassment Guidance.<ref></ref>
====EEOC Definition====
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claims that it is unlawful to harass an applicant or employee of any sex in the workplace. The harassment could include sexual harassment. The EEOC says that the victim and harasser could be any gender and that the other does not have to be of the opposite sex. The law does not ban offhand comments, simple teasing, or incidents that aren't very serious. If the harassment gets to the point where it creates a harsh work environment, it will be taken care of.<ref name="eeoc"/> In 1980, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission produced a set of guidelines for defining and enforcing Title VII (in 1984 it was expanded to include educational institutions). The EEOC defines sexual harassment as:
Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:
# Submission to such conduct was made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment,
# Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual was used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or
# Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.
1. and 2. are called "quid pro quo" (Latin for "this for that" or "something for something"). They are essentially "sexual bribery", or promising of benefits, and "sexual coercion".
Type 3. known as "hostile work environment", is by far the most common form. This form is less clear cut and is more subjective.<ref name="webcom" />
Note: a workplace harassment complainant must file with the EEOC and receive a "right to sue" clearance, before they can file a lawsuit against a company in federal court.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
=====Quid pro quo sexual harassment=====
Quid pro quo means "this for that." In the workplace, this occurs when a job benefit is directly tied to an employee submitting to unwelcome sexual advances. For example, a supervisor promises an employee a raise if he or she will go out on a date with him or her, or tells an employee he or she will be fired if he or she doesn't sleep with him or her.<ref></ref> Quid pro quo harassment also occurs when an employee makes an evaluative decision, or provides or withholds professional opportunities based on another employee's submission to verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Quid pro quo harassment is equally unlawful whether the victim resists and suffers the threatened harm or submits and thus avoids the threatened harm.<ref></ref>
=====Hostile environment sexual harassment=====
This occurs when an employee is subjected to comments of a sexual nature, unwelcome physical contact, or offensive sexual materials as a regular part of the work environment. For the most part, a single isolated incident will not be enough to prove hostile environment harassment unless it involves extremely outrageous and egregious conduct. The courts will try to decide whether the conduct is both "serious" and "frequent." Supervisors, managers, co-workers and even customers can be responsible for creating a hostile environment.<ref></ref>
The line between "quid pro quo" and "hostile environment" harassment is not always clear and the two forms of harassment often occur together. For example, an employee's job conditions are affected when a sexually hostile work environment results in a constructive discharge. At the same time, a supervisor who makes sexual advances toward a subordinate employee may communicate an implicit threat to retaliate against her if she does not comply.<ref></ref>
<blockquote>"Hostile environment" harassment may acquire characteristics of "quid pro quo" harassment if the offending supervisor abuses his authority over employment decisions to force the victim to endure or participate in the sexual conduct. Sexual harassment may culminate in a retaliatory discharge if a victim tells the harasser or her employer she will no longer submit to the harassment, and is then fired in retaliation for this protest. Under these circumstances it would be appropriate to conclude that both harassment and retaliation in violation of section 704(a) of Title VII have occurred."</blockquote>
=====Sexual orientation discrimination=====
In the United States, there are no federal laws prohibiting discrimination against employees based on their sexual orientation. However, Executive Order 13087, signed by President Bill Clinton, outlaws discrimination based on sexual orientation against federal government employees. If a small business owner owns his or her business in a state where there is a law against sexual orientation discrimination, the owner must abide to the law regardless of there not being a federal law. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have laws against this form of discrimination in the workplace. These states include California, Connecticut, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.<ref></ref> For example, California has laws in place to protect employees who may have been discriminated against based upon sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation. California law prohibits discrimination against those "with traits not stereotypically associated with their gender", such as mannerisms, appearance, or speech. Sexual orientation discrimination comes up, for instance, when employers enforce a dress code, permit women to wear makeup but not men, or require men and women to only use restrooms designated for their particular sex regardless of whether they are transgender.
=====Retaliation=====
Retaliation has occurred when an employee suffers a negative action after he or she has made a report of sexual harassment, file a grievance, assist someone else with a complaint, or participate in discrimination prevention activities. Negative actions can include being fired, demotion, suspension, denial of promotion, poor evaluation, unfavorable job reassignment—any adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely to dissuade a "reasonable worker" from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. (See Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White.)<ref></ref> Retaliation is as illegal as the sexual harassment itself, but also as difficult to prove. Also, retaliation is illegal even if the original charge of sexual harassment was not proven.
=====New Jersey=====
New Jersey was historically known to have one of the strongest anti-sexual harassment laws in the United States. The Law Against Discrimination used to hold an employer liable if the sexual harassment was done by a member of upper-level management. In 2015, the New Jersey Supreme Court modified the precedence in the State of New Jersey and prevented the company from being liable if they had a well-published and enforced anti-harassment policy. Accordingly, if a policy existed and was enforced, the victim or witness to the sexual harassment would need to complain about the conduct. The company would not be liable if they investigate the matter and take some remedial measures to make sure that the harassment stops. The Company only becomes liable if the activity occurs again. (See Aguas v. NJ.)<ref></ref>
== Historical antecedents ==
=== Ancient Rome ===
In ancient Rome, according to Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, what is now called sexual harassment<ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468">Frier, Bruce W., & Thomas A.J. McGinn, A Casebook on Roman Family Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, pbk. 2004 , p.&nbsp;468 (author Frier prof. classics & Roman law, Univ. of Michigan, & coauthor McGinn assoc. prof. classical studies, Vanderbilt Univ.).</ref> was then any of accosting, stalking, and abducting. Accosting was "harassment through attempted seduction"<ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /> or another's chastity with smooth talk&nbsp;. contrary to good morals",<ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /> which was more than the lesser offense(s) of "obscene speech, dirty jokes, and the like",<ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /> "foul language",<ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /> and "clamor",<ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /> with the accosting of "respectable young girls" who, however, were dressed in slaves' clothing being a lesser offense<ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /> and the accosting of "women&nbsp;. dressed as prostitutes" being an even lesser offense.<ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /> Stalking was "silently, persistently pursuing"<ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /> if it was "contrary to good morals",<ref></ref> because a pursuer's "ceaseless presence virtually ensures appreciable disrepute".<ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /> Abducting an attendant, who was someone who follows someone else as a companion and could be a slave,<ref name=":9"></ref> was "successfully forcing or persuading the attendant to leave the side of the intended target",<ref name=":9" /> but abducting while the woman "has not been wearing respectable clothing" was a lesser offense.<ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" />
== Criticism ==
Though the phrase sexual harassment is generally acknowledged to include clearly damaging and morally deplorable behavior, its boundaries can be broad and controversial. Accordingly, misunderstandings can occur. In the US, sexual harassment law has been criticized by persons such as the criminal defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz and the legal writer and libertarian Eugene Volokh, for imposing limits on the right to free speech.<ref></ref>
Jana Rave, professor in organizational studies at the Queen's School of Business, criticized sexual harassment policy in the Ottawa Business Journal as helping maintain archaic stereotypes of women as "delicate, asexual creatures" who require special protection when at the same time complaints are lowering company profits.<ref name="janaraver"></ref> Camille Paglia says that young girls can end up acting in such ways as to make sexual harassment easier, such that for example, by acting "nice" they can become a target. Paglia commented in an interview with Playboy, "Realize the degree to which your niceness may invoke people to say lewd and pornographic things to you--sometimes to violate your niceness. The more you blush, the more people want to do it."<ref></ref>
Other critics assert that sexual harassment is a very serious problem, but current views focus too heavily on sexuality rather than on the type of conduct that undermines the ability of women or men to work together effectively. Viki Shultz, a law professor at Yale University comments, "Many of the most prevalent forms of harassment are designed to maintain work—particularly the more highly rewarded lines of work—as bastions of male competence and authority."<ref></ref> Feminist Jane Gallop sees this evolution of the definition of sexual harassment as coming from a "split" between what she calls "power feminists" who are pro-sex (like herself) and what she calls "victim feminists", who are not. She argues that the split has helped lead to a perversion of the definition of sexual harassment, which used to be about sexism but has come to be about anything that's sexual.<ref>Gallop, Jane. urltoken Feminist Accused of Sexual Harassment. Duke University Press, 1997. .</ref>
There is also concern over abuses of sexual harassment policy by individuals as well as by employers and administrators using false or frivolous accusations as a way of expelling employees they want to eliminate for other reasons. These employees often have virtually no recourse thanks to the at-will law in most US states.<ref>Westhues, Kenneth. Eliminating Professors: A Guide to the Dismissal Process. Lewiston, NY: The Edwin Mellen Press, 1998. .</ref>
O'Donohue and Bowers outlined 14 possible pathways to false allegations of sexual harassment: "lying, borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, psychosis, gender prejudice, substance abuse, dementia, false memories, false interpretations, biased interviews, sociopathy, personality disorders not otherwise specified."<ref></ref>
There is also discussion of whether some recent trends towards more revealing clothing and permissive habits have created a more sexualized general environment, in which some forms of communication are unfairly labeled harassment, but are simply a reaction to greater sexualization in everyday environments.<ref>Parker, Kathleen. " urltoken 'Save the males': Ho culture lights fuses, but confuses ." New York Daily News. June 30, 2008. Based on Save the Males by Kathleen Parker, 2008, Random House.</ref>
There are many debates about how organizations should deal with sexual harassment. Some observers feel strongly that organizations should be held to a zero tolerance standard of "Must report—must investigate—must punish."
Others write that those who feel harassed should in most circumstances have a choice of options.<ref name="maryrowe"/><ref name="DoiBFMissing" /><ref></ref>
Sexual harassment laws may also be used unfairly applied in effect. Unsolicited sexual advances were considered more disturbing and more discomforting when perpetrated by an unattractive opposite sex colleague than when perpetrated by an attractive opposite sex colleague.<ref></ref>
