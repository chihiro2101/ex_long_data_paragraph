Dating creation

== Sumerian and Babylonian ==
The standard ancient Sumerian King List (WB 444) lists various mythical antediluvian kings and gives them reigns of several tens of thousands of years. The first Sumerian king Alulim, at Eridu, is described as reigning for 28,800 years, followed by several later kings of similar periods. In total these antediluvian kings ruled for 241,200 years from the time when "the kingship was lowered from heaven" to the time when "the flood" swept over the land.<ref>The Sumerian King List, Thorkild Jacobsen, 1939, pp. 71, 77).</ref> Excavations in Iraq have revealed evidence of localized flooding at Shuruppak (modern Tell Fara, Iraq) and various other Sumerian cities—all dated to the same time. A layer of riverine sediments, radiocarbon dated to ca. 2900 BC, interrupts the continuity of settlement, extending as far north as the city of Kish. Polychrome pottery from the Jemdet Nasr period (3000–2900 BC) was discovered immediately below the Shuruppak flood stratum. The "flood" described in the Sumerian King List, is believed to have a historical basis, and has been dated 2900 BC.<ref>Sumer and the Sumerians, Harriet Crawford, Cambridge University Press, 2004.</ref> Adding 241,200 years to 2900 gives the date 244,100 BC; however, most modern scholars do not believe the ancient Sumerians or Babylonians believed in a chronology of their own this old. Instead they believed that these figures were either fabrications, or were based on not literal solar years (365.2425 days) but instead lunar months (29.53059 days).<ref>"Science Deified & Science Defied: The Historical Significance of Science in Western Culture, Part 1640", p. 45, by Richard Olson, publisher = University of California Press</ref>
Cicero, reacting to the chronologies of such authors as Berossos (who composed a Greek-language history of Babylonia, known as the Babyloniaca, during the 3rd century BC) strongly criticised the claim that the Babylonians had kings going back hundreds of thousands of years:
Diodorus Siculus also wrote something similar about how he believed the Babylonians fabricated their chronology:
Despite these criticisms, some ancient Greeks, including most notably Alexander Polyhistor and Proclus, believed the Babylonian kings were hundreds of thousands of years old, and that the Babylonians dated their creation 400,000–200,000 years before their own time.<ref></ref><ref>Proclus,In Timaeum, i.</ref>
==Egyptian==
The ancient Turin King List lists a mythical predynastic "reign of the gods" which first occurred 36,620 years before Menes (3050 BC), therefore dating the creation to around 39,670 BC.<ref>The Turin Papyrus (in the register listing the Reign of the Gods) the final two lines of the column sums up: "Venerables Shemsu-Hor, 13,420 years; Reigns before the Shemsu-Hor, 23,200 years; Total 36,620 years." Scholars such as Wilkinson (1851), Bunsen (1845) and Meyer (1904) all came to the same conclusion independently. This finding was later popularized by several non-scholarly books.</ref>
Fragments from Manetho (Eusebius, George Syncellus and preserved in Felix Jacoby's FGrH), however, list different dates.<ref>Manetho, (trans. W. G. Waddell), William Heinemann, London, 1940, Introduction pp. xvi-xvii</ref> Eusebius, regarding Aegyptiaca, in his Chronicle recorded that:
==Chinese==
The ancient Chinese historian Xu Zheng in his Three Five Historic Records dated the creation of the world by Pangu 36,000 years (2 x 18,000) before the reign of the legendary Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors.<ref></ref><ref>Ancient Chinese Civilization, Rupert Matthews, Todd Van Pelt, The Rosen Publishing Group, 2009, p.6</ref><ref>Handbook of Chinese Mythology, Lihui Yang, ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 176.</ref> The date of the Three sovereigns is fixed at 3000–2700 BC<ref>Footbinding: a Jungian engagement with Chinese culture and psychology, Shirley See Yan Ma, Taylor & Francis, 2010, Page xvii</ref> and therefore dates the creation about 39,000&nbsp;BC.
==Maya==
The Mesoamerican Long Count calendar dates the creation of the world of human beings to 11 August 3114 BC (in the most commonly accepted correlation) according to the proleptic Gregorian calendar, or Monday, 6 September 3114 BC according to the proleptic Julian calendar.<ref>David Freidel, Linda Schele, and Joy Parker, Maya Cosmos: Three thousand years on the shaman's path (New York: William Morrow, 1993) pp.59–75.</ref> There was also a previous creation that did not have a beginning date, but a date on Stela F from Quirigua refers to a date possibly 24 trillion years in the past.<ref>Matthew G.

===Genesis creation narrative===
Within the biblical framework and chronology, various dates have been proposed for the date of creation since ancient times, to more recent periods. The Bible begins with the Book of Genesis, in which God creates the Earth, the rest of the Universe, and the Earth's plants and animals, including the first humans, in six days. A second narrative begins with the first human pair, Adam and Eve, and goes on to list many of their descendants, in many cases giving the ages at which they had children and died. If these events and ages are interpreted literally throughout and the genealogies are considered closed, it is possible to build up a chronology in which many of the events of the Old Testament are dated to an estimated number of years after creation. Some biblical scholars have gone further, attempting to harmonise this biblical chronology with that of recorded history, thus establishing a date for creation in a modern calendar. Since the biblical story lacks chronology for some periods, the duration of events has been subject to interpretation in many different ways, resulting in a variety of estimates of the date of creation.
Numerous efforts have been made to determine the biblical date of creation, yielding varying results. Besides differences in interpretation, the use of different versions of the Bible can also affect the result. Two dominant dates for creation using such models exist, about 5500 BC and about 4000 BC. These were calculated from the genealogies in two versions of the Bible, with most of the difference arising from two versions of Genesis. The older dates stem from the Greek Septuagint.<ref> urltoken Septuagint, Genesis </ref> The later dates are based on the Hebrew Masoretic text.<ref></ref> The patriarchs from Adam to Terah, the father of Abraham, were often 100 years older when they begat their named son in the Septuagint than they were in the Hebrew or the Vulgate (Genesis 5, 11). The net difference between the two genealogies of Genesis amounts to 1466 years (ignoring the "second year after the flood" ambiguity), which accounts for virtually all of the 1500-year difference between 5500 BC and 4000 BC. For example, the period from the creation to the Flood derives from the genealogical table of the ten patriarchs listed in , and , called the generations of Adam. According to the Masoretic Text, this period consists of 1,656 years, and Western Christian Bibles deriving from the Latin Vulgate also follow this dating. However, the Samaritan texts give an equivalent period of 1,307 years, and according to the Septuagint (Codex Alexandrinus, Elizabeth Bible) it is 2,262 years.<ref>Catholic Encyclopedia: Biblical Chronology</ref> James Ussher agrees with the dating until the birth of Abraham, which he argues took place when Terah was 130, and not 70 as is the direct reading of , thus adding 60 years to his chronology for events postdating Abraham.<ref name=Jones278></ref>
===Early Jewish estimations===
The earliest post-exilic Jewish chronicle preserved in the Hebrew language, the Seder Olam Rabbah, compiled by Jose ben Halafta in 160 AD, dates the creation of the world to 3761 BC while the later Seder Olam Zutta to 4339 BC.<ref>Young’s Analytical Concordance of the Holy Bible, 1879, 8th Edition, 1939—entry under ‘Creation’ quoting Dr. William Hales New Analysis of Chronology and Geography, History and Prophecy, Vol. 1, 1830, p. 210.</ref> The Hebrew Calendar has traditionally, since the 4th century AD by Hillel II, dated the creation to 3761 BC.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
===Septuagint===
Many of the earliest Christians who used the Septuagint version of the Bible calculated creation as having occurred about 5500 BC, and Christians up to the Middle-Ages continued to use this rough estimate: Clement of Alexandria (5592 BC), Theophilus of Antioch (5529 BC), Sextus Julius Africanus (5501 BC), Hippolytus of Rome (5500 BC), Gregory of Tours (5500 BC), Panodorus of Alexandria (5493 BC), Maximus the Confessor (5493 BC), George Syncellus (5492 BC), Sulpicius Severus (5469 BC) and Isidore of Seville (5336 BC).<ref>A Collation of the Sacred Scriptures, Charles Roger Dundee, 1847, p. 20.</ref><ref></ref><ref name=Jones26></ref> The Byzantine calendar has traditionally dated the creation of the world to September 1, 5509 BC.
The Chronicon (Eusebius) (early 4th century) dated creation to 5228 BC while Jerome (c. 380, Constantinople) dated creation to 5199 BC.<ref> urltoken The Penn Commentary on Piers Plowman by Andrew Galloway page 69</ref> In the Roman Martyrology, the Proclamation of the Birth of Christ formerly used this date,<ref></ref> as did the Irish Annals of the Four Masters.<ref> urltoken from 5194 AM in the Annals at CELT — University College Cork's Corpus of Electronic Texts project has the full text of the annals online, both in the original Irish and in O'Donovan's translation</ref>
Bede was one of the first to break away from the standard Septuagint date for the creation and in his work De Temporibus ("On Time") (completed in 703 AD) dated the creation to 18 March 3952 BC but was accused of heresy at the table of Bishop Wilfrid, because his chronology was contrary to accepted calculations of around 5500 BC.<ref>The Reckoning of Time, Wallis, Faith, trans, pp. xxx, 405–415.</ref>
===Masoretic===
After the Masoretic Text was published, however, dating creation around 4000 BC became common, and was received with wide support.<ref>A Collation of the Sacred Scriptures, Charles Roger Dundee, 1847, pp. 10-24.</ref> Proposed calculations of the date of creation using the Masoretic from the 10th century to the 18th century include: Marianus Scotus (4192 BC), Henry Fynes Clinton (4138 BC), Maimonides (4058 BC), Henri Spondanus (4051 BC), Benedict Pereira (4021 BC), Louis Cappel (4005 BC), James Ussher (4004 BC), Augustin Calmet (4002 BC), Isaac Newton (4000 BC), Petavius (3984 BC), Theodore Bibliander (3980 BC), Johannes Kepler (April 27, 3977 BC) based on his book Mysterium Cosmographicum, Heinrich Bünting (3967 BC), Christen Sørensen Longomontanus (3966 BC), Melanchthon (3964 BC), Martin Luther (3961 BC), Cornelius Cornelii a Lapide (3961 BC), John Lightfoot (3960 BC), Joseph Justus Scaliger (3949 BC), Christoph Helvig (3947 BC), Gerardus Mercator (3928 BC), Matthieu Brouard (3927 BC), Benito Arias Montano (3849 BC), Andreas Helwig (3836 BC), David Gans (3761 BC), Gershom ben Judah (3754 BC) and Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller (3616 BC).<ref name=Jones26 />
Among the Masoretic creation estimates or calculations for the date of creation only Archbishop Ussher's specific chronology dating the creation to 4004 BC became the most accepted and popular, mainly because this specific date was attached to the King James Bible.<ref></ref>
===Alfonsine tables===
Alfonso X of Castile commissioned the Alfonsine tables, composed of astronomical data based on observation, from which the date of the creation has been calculated to be either 6984 BC.<ref>Young’s Analytical Concordance of the Holy Bible, 1879 8th Edition, 1939—entry under ‘Creation’.</ref><ref>New Analysis of Chronology and Geography, History and Prophecy, William Hales, vol. 1, p. 210, 1830.</ref><ref></ref>
===Other biblical estimations===
In 1738, said he had collected over 200 different estimates, ranging from 3483 BC to 6984 BC.<ref></ref> John Clark Ridpath attributes these values respectively to Yom-Tov Lipmann-Muhlhausen and Regiomontanus.<ref></ref>
* Christian Charles Josias Bunsen in the 19th century dated the creation to 20,000 BC.<ref>Epoch of Creation according to various authorities in Pre-Adamites by Walter Winchell, 1880.</ref>

Dating creation is the attempt to provide an estimate of the age of Earth or the age of the universe as understood through the origin myths of various religious traditions. Various traditional story held that Earth, or the entire Universe, was brought into being in a grand creation myth by one or more gods. Once these cultures developed calendars, many began to ponder the question of precisely how long ago this event happened.
