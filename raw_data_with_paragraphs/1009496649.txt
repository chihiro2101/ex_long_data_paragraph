Anderlecht

==History==
===Origins and medieval times===
The first traces of human activity on the right bank of the Zenne date from the Stone Age and Bronze Age. The remnants of a Roman villa and of a Franks necropolis were also found on the territory of Anderlecht. The first mention of the name Anderlecht, however, dates only from 1047 under the forms Anrelech, then Andrelet (1111), Andreler (1148), and Anderlech (1186). At that time, this community was already home to a chapter of canons and to two feudal manors, those of the powerful lords of Aa and of Anderlecht.
In 1356, Louis II of Flanders, fought against Brussels on the territory of Anderlecht, in the so-called Battle of Scheut, supposedly over a monetary matter. Although he defeated his sister-in-law, Joanna, Duchess of Brabant, and briefly took her title, she regained it the following year with the help of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1393, Joanna's charter made Anderlecht a part of Brussels. It is also around this time that the church of Saint Guy was rebuilt above the earlier Romanesque crypt in the Brabantian Gothic style.
===15th–18th centuries===
The city of Anderlecht became a beacon of culture in the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1521, Erasmus lived in the Erasmus House for a few months. Charles, Duke of Aumale and Grand Veneur of France also had a residence here.
The 17th and 18th centuries were marked by the wars between the Low Countries and France. On 13 November 1792, right after the Battle of Jemappes, General Dumouriez and the French Revolutionary army routed the Austrians here once again. Among the consequences were the disbanding of the canons and Anderlecht being proclaimed an independent municipality by the French.
===19th century and later===
The 19th century saw a remarkable population growth, mainly because of the proximity to a rapidly expanding Brussels. Remarkable new urban developments and garden cities such as Het Rad, Moortebeek and / were built at the beginning of the 20th century to house the influx of newcomers. Today, the name Anderlecht rings a bell in every Belgian ear thanks to its very successful football club.
==Districts==

Formerly known as Rinck, it is divided into several sectors: the / district, also called the Vaillance (Dutch: Dapperheid) district, is the meeting point for those who hail to the heart of Anderlecht. It is also where the Place de la Vaillance with its Collegiate Church, the /, as well as Anderlecht's main schools are located. / is the municipality's main shopping street.

===Cureghem/Kuregem===
Located in the east of Anderlecht, the Cureghem (Dutch: district is one of the municipality's largest and most populated neighbourhoods. It developed during the Industrial Revolution along the Brussels–Charleroi Canal and is currently in a fragile social and economic situation due to the decline of its economy and the poor quality of some of its housing. Between 1836 and 1991, the district housed the Royal School of Veterinary Medicine, now moved to Liège but often still referred to as 'Cureghem'. The old campus, listed as protected heritage, is currently facing a large process of rehabilitation.
Three listed buildings; the former Atlas Brewery, the old power station and the former Moulart Mill are testaments to the old industrial activities next to the waterway. The Town Hall of Anderlecht is located on the /, at the heart of this district.
===La Roue/Het Rad===
Located in the south of Anderlecht, the La Roue (Dutch: district is one of the largest districts of the municipality and one of the garden cities of the Brussels region. Built in the 1920s, with its modest and picturesque houses, it offers a great vision of an early 20th century working class neighbourhood. It is also home to one of the largest agribusiness industry campuses in Belgium, CERIA/COOVI, and other popular department stores.

*The Collegiate Church of St. Peter and St. Guido is located in the municipality's historical centre, on the northern side of the Place de la Vaillance, its main square. It contains the grave of the 11th century saint Guy of Anderlecht. Its Romanesque crypt dates from the 10th century and is one of the oldest in Belgium. Most of the church, however, dates from 1350 and later, with most of the currently visible architecture representing the Ogee style (15th–16th centuries).
