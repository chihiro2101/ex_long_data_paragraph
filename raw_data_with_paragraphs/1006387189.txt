Eel Pie Island

==Name and former names==
The name may have come from eel pies which were served by the inn on the island in the 19th century. Its earlier names chronologically were the Parish Ait and Twickenham Ait, the latter co-existing until at least the 1880s. Before the 19th century it was for many centuries three parts distinguished by their proudness above the ordinary mean high water mark.

===Early history===
Some mesolithic red deer antler bone hand-made implements have been retrieved from the island's shore.<ref>'Archaeology: The Mesolithic Age', in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 1, Physique, Archaeology, Domesday, Ecclesiastical Organization, the Jews, Religious Houses, Education of Working Classes To 1870, Private Education From Sixteenth Century, ed.

===Eel Pie House===
An inn was on the Ait by 1743<ref name=reynolds>'Twickenham: Economic and social history', in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 3, ed. Susan Reynolds (London, 1962), pp. 151-155. British History Online urltoken accessed 14 December 2017</ref> and in the 19th century it was a popular stopping point for steamer excursions.<ref name=reynolds/> When a new inn was built in 1830 to replace it, the former venue was alternatively called a "dingy wooden cottage" or an "unassuming but popular little barn".<ref name=reynolds/>
Samuel Lewis's national gazetteer of 1848 devotes a large minority of the text covering Twickenham to the island; saying it is: 
The ait is recorded in at least two distinct parts in detailed maps until the end of the 19th century; the west part was built up in height and measured .<ref name=osoldmaps>OS 25-inch map of 1894, Surrey sheet VI.7 revised 1893–94, published 1898.</ref> Its named features were a large Boat House, the Island Hotel, a bowling green in the west and the Thames Electric & Steam Launch Works.<ref name=osoldmaps/> The east end is marked with marsh plantation and liable to flood; it was in the same maps measured at and together the parts form the same land as today.<ref name=osoldmaps/>
A bridge was proposed to Middlesex County Council or the Metropolitan Borough of Twickenham in 1889. A set of rope pulleys operated in the early 20th century for assisting transporting light goods. It was not until 1957 that the first bridge to the ait was completed.
===Eel Pie Island Hotel===
The island was the site of the Eel Pie Island Hotel, originally a genteel 19th-century three-storey building that later hosted ballroom dancing during the 1920s and 1930s.<ref></ref> In 1956, trumpeter Brian Rutland, who ran a local band called The Grove Jazz Band, started jazz sessions at the newly reopened hotel.<ref name="Eel Pie"></ref> Some time afterwards, Arthur Chisnall took over the running of the club and continued to promote various jazz bands and then, in the 1960s, rock and R&B groups.<ref name=BBC></ref><ref name='Vat'></ref>
Famous names who performed at the dance hall between 1957 and 1967 include:

*The Tridents (featuring Jeff Beck)<ref name="Museum"/>

In 1967, the hotel was forced to close because the owner could not meet the £200,000 cost of repairs demanded by police.<ref name="Museum"/> In 1969, the club briefly reopened as Colonel Barefoot's Rock Garden,<ref name="Membury"/> with bands such as Black Sabbath,<ref name="Membury"/> The Edgar Broughton Band,<ref name="Membury"/> Stray, Genesis, and Hawkwind<ref name="Membury"/> (then known as Hawkwind Zoo) performing there.
Caldwell Smythe (entrepreneur, vocalist, ex-Riot Squad and, briefly, The Honeycombs) said: "I approached the owner, Mr Snapper, who lived in Kingston and we agreed a rental deal. I called it Colonel Barefoot's Rock Garden and plastered west London with quad crown posters." Smythe booked bands such as Edgar Broughton, Free, Deep Purple, King Crimson, Genesis, Wishbone Ash and Mott The Hoople. Smythe said: "There were two stages: the headliner was on the big stage and the support on the small stage with the light show projectionist above it. We had a bar doing tea, soft drinks, hot dogs and hamburgers. We then did Colonel Barefoot's Killer Punch (cider, cooking brandy and cinnamon) and we gave it away along with beer in half pint plastic disposable cups. I had rows with the fire department as the emergency exits were chained shut to stop people bunking in. Eventually, after a raid by the Fire Chief, I closed down and walked. I was living in Chiswick at this time."
In 1969, the hotel was occupied by a small group of local Anarchism including illustrator Clifford Harper. By 1970 the Eel Pie Island Commune had become the UK's largest hippie commune.<ref name='Faiers'></ref>
The building had by now fallen into disrepair and was placed under a demolition order. However, in 1971 the Eel Pie Island Hotel burned down in a mysterious fire.<ref name="Museum"/><ref name="Kilvington"/>
The centre of the island was devastated by fire in 1996, and a year later, the only footbridge to the island was damaged by a utilities contractor.<ref name="Kilvington"></ref> A new footbridge opened in August 1998.<ref name="Kilvington"/>
==Description and uses==
The island has about 50 homes, 120 inhabitants and two or three boatyards, as well as some other small businesses and artists' studios. It has nature reserves at both ends, protected from public access. All plots and walkways are privately owned. The public can access the island's main pathway from the bridge, which does not skirt or overlook any of its shore. 
===Artists===
For brief periods each year, usually in June and December, 26 studios in and around a working boatyard, collectively known as Eel Pie Island Art Studios, open to the public, enabling them to enjoy and buy the artists' works.<ref> urltoken 
===Water sports===
The island is home to Twickenham Rowing Club, one of the oldest rowing clubs on the Thames, and Richmond Yacht Club.<ref></ref>
