Gaius Valerius Flaccus (poet)

==Life==
The only widely accepted mention of Valerius Flaccus by his contemporaries is by Quintilian (10.1.90),<ref name="Quintilian1.90"></ref> who laments the recent death of "Valerius Flaccus" as a great loss; as Quintilian's work was finished about 90 AD, this traditionally gives a limit for the death of Valerius Flaccus. Recent scholarship, however, puts forward an alternative date of about 95 AD, and definitely before the death of Domitian in 96 AD.<ref>Valerius Flaccus, Valerius Flaccus: Argonautica, Book 3 (Cambridge University Press, 2015) urltoken page 1.</ref>
It has been claimed that he was a member of the College of Fifteen, who had charge of the Sibylline books, based on a reference in his work to the presence of a tripod in a "pure home" (1.5).<ref name="Argonautica1.5"></ref> The assumption that this indicates he himself was a member, however, has also been contested.<ref name="OxCompClass" /><ref name="DictGreekRoman"></ref>
A contested mention of a poet of the name "Valerius Flaccus" is by Martial (1.76),<ref name="Martial1.76"></ref> who refers to a native of Padua. A subscription in the Vatican manuscript adds the name Setinus Balbus, a name which suggests that its holder was a native of Sezze in Latium, however it is not clear if this inscription refers to "Valerius Flaccus" or someone else.<ref name="DictGreekRoman" /> The connection of this "Valerius Flaccus" to Gaius Valerius Flaccus has been contested under the assumption that Martial was referring to the friend's financial strife, and that Gaius Valerius Flaccus was a member of the College of Fifteen, and therefore likely to have been wealthy.<ref name="OxBib" />
==Argonautica==
Valerius Flaccus' only surviving work, the Argonautica, was dedicated to Vespasian on his setting out for Britain. It was written during the siege, or shortly after the capture, of Jerusalem by Titus in 70 AD. As the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD is alluded to, its composition must have occupied him a long time. The Argonautica is an epic poem probably intended to be in eight books (though intended totals of ten and twelve books, the latter corresponding to Virgil's Aeneid, an important poetic model, have also been proposed) written in traditional dactylic hexameters, which recounts Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece.<ref name="OxBib" />
The Argonautica was lost until 1411, when the first 4½ volumes were found at St Gall in 1417 and published at Bologna in 1474.<ref> urltoken Gaius Valerius Flaccus at theodora.com.</ref>
The poem's text, as it has survived, is in a very corrupt state; it ends so abruptly with the request of Medea to accompany Jason on his homeward voyage, that it is assumed by most modern scholars<ref>J.H.Mozley, in Loeb Classical Library, A.J. Kleywegt (2005) and others.</ref> that it was never finished. It is a free imitation and in parts a translation of the Argonautica of Apollonius of Rhodes, "to whom he is superior in arrangement, vividness, and description of character" (Loeb Classical Library). The familiar subject had already been treated in Latin verse in the popular version of Varro Atacinus. The object of the work has been described as the glorification of Vespasian's achievements<ref> urltoken Valerius Flaccus, Gaius active 1st century at World cat identies.</ref> in securing Roman rule in Britain and opening up the ocean to navigation (as the Euxine was opened up by the Argo).
In 1911, the compilers of the Encyclopædia Britannica remarked, 
More modern analysis has been more accepting of Valerius Flaccus' style, noting how it fits in the "long and energetic Roman tradition of appropriation of the golden age and iron age myths"<ref name="OxCompClass" /> and commenting on his narrative technique:

;Recent scholarship
Increased interest in the last decades has resulted in a full-length general introduction (Debra Hershkowitz, Valerius Flaccus' Argonautica: Abbreviated Voyages in Silver Latin Epic, Oxford University Press, 1999), two new editions, in 1997 (Liberman) and 2003, a commentary on the whole poem by F.
