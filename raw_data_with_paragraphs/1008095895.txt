Idolatry

==Etymology and nomenclature==
The word idolatry comes from the Greek word eidololatria (εἰδωλολατρία) which itself is a compound of two words: eidolon (εἴδωλον "image") and latreia (λατρεία "worship", related to λάτρις).<ref></ref> The word eidololatria thus means "worship of idols", which in Latin appears first as idololatria, then in Vulgar Latin as idolatria, therefrom it appears in 12th century Old French as idolatrie, which for the first time in mid 13th century English appears as "idolatry".<ref>Douglas Harper (2015), Etymology Dictionary, urltoken Idolatry</ref><ref></ref>
Although the Greek appears to be a calque of the Hebrew phrase avodat elilim, which is attested in rabbinic literature (e.g., bChul., 13b, Bar.), the Greek term itself is not found in the Septuagint, Philo, Josephus, or in other Hellenistic Jewish writings. The original term used in early rabbinic writings is oved avodah zarah (AAZ, worship of avoda zara, or "pagan"), while avodat kochavim umazalot (AKUM, worship of planets and constellations) is not found in its early manuscripts.<ref></ref> The later Jews used the term , avodh zereh, meaning "strange worship".<ref></ref>
Idolatry has also been called idolism,<ref> urltoken idolism, Merriam Webster;<br></ref> iconolatry<ref> urltoken iconolatry, Merriam Webster;<br></ref> or idolodulia in historic literature.<ref>;<br>See John Calvin (1537) urltoken The Institutes of the Christian Religion, Quote: "The worship which they pay to their images they cloak with the name of εἰδωλοδυλεία (idolodulia), and deny to be εἰδωλολατϱεία (idolatria). So they speak, holding that the worship which they call dulia may, without insult to God, be paid to statues and pictures. (.) For the Greek word λατϱεύειν having no other meaning than to worship, what they say is just the same as if they were to confess that they worship their images without worshipping them. They cannot object that I am quibbling upon words. (.) But how eloquent soever they may be, they will never prove by their eloquence that one and the same thing makes two. Let them show how the things differ if they would be thought different from ancient idolaters."</ref>
==Prehistoric and ancient civilizations==
The earliest so-called Venus figurines have been dated to the prehistoric Upper Paleolithic era (35–40 ka onwards).<ref></ref> Archaeological evidence from the islands of the Aegean Sea have yielded Neolithic era Cycladic figures from 4th and 3rd millennium BC, idols in namaste posture from Indus Valley civilization sites from the 3rd millennium BC, and much older petroglyphs around the world show humans began producing sophisticated images.<ref></ref><ref>National Museum, urltoken Seated Male in Namaskar pose, New Delhi, Government of India;<br>S Kalyanaraman (2007), Indus Script Cipher: Hieroglyphs of Indian Linguistic Area, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 234–236</ref> However, because of a lack of historic texts describing these, it is unclear what, if any connection with religious beliefs, these figures had,<ref name="Moorey2003p1"/> or whether they had other meaning and uses, even as toys.<ref>S.

The earliest historic records confirming cult images are from the ancient Egyptian civilization, thereafter related to the Greek civilization.<ref name="Johnson2010p50"></ref> By the 2nd millennium BC two broad forms of cult image appear, in one images are zoomorphic (god in the image of animal or animal-human fusion) and in another anthropomorphic (god in the image of man).<ref name="Moorey2003p1"></ref> The former is more commonly found in ancient Egypt influenced beliefs, while the anthropomorphic images are more commonly found in Indo-European cultures.<ref name="Johnson2010p50"/><ref name="Adams1997p44"></ref> Symbols of nature, useful animals or feared animals may also be included by both. The Stele from 4,000 to 2,500 BC period discovered in France, Ireland through Ukraine, and in Central Asia through South Asia, suggest that the ancient anthropomorphic figures included zoomorphic motifs.<ref name="Adams1997p44"/> In Nordic and Indian subcontinent, bovine (cow, ox, -*gwdus, -*g'ou) motifs or statues, for example, were common.<ref name="Sax2001p48"></ref><ref></ref> In Ireland, iconic images included pigs.<ref></ref>
The Ancient Egyptian religion was polytheistic, with large cult images that were either animals or included animal parts. Ancient Greek civilization preferred human forms, with idealized proportions, for divine representation.<ref name="Johnson2010p50"/> The Canaanites of West Asia incorporated a golden calf in their pantheon.<ref name=johnson21></ref>
The ancient philosophy and practices of the Greeks, thereafter Romans, were imbued with polytheistic idolatry.<ref></ref><ref name="Urbano2013"></ref> They debate what is an image and if the use of image is appropriate. To Plato, images can be a remedy or poison to the human experience.<ref name="Dawson2008"/> To Aristotle, states Paul Kugler, an image is an appropriate mental intermediary that "bridges between the inner world of the mind and the outer world of material reality", the image is a vehicle between sensation and reason. Idols are useful psychological catalysts, they reflect sense data and pre-existing inner feelings. They are neither the origins nor the destinations of thought but the intermediary in the human inner journey.<ref name="Dawson2008"></ref><ref></ref> Fervid opposition to the idolatry of the Greeks and Romans was of Early Christianity and later Islam, as evidenced by the widespread desecration and defacement of ancient Greek and Roman sculptures that have survived into the modern era.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>

===Judaism===
 permitted.<ref name="Kogan1992p169"/><ref name=novak73></ref>
Many Jewish scholars such as Rabbi Saadia Gaon, Rabbi Bahya ibn Paquda, and Rabbi Yehuda Halevi have elaborated on the issues of idolatry. One of the oft-cited discussions is the commentary of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (Maimonides) on idolatry.<ref name=novak73/> According to the Maimonidean interpretation, idolatry in itself is not a fundamental sin, but the grave sin is the belief that God can be corporeal. In the Jewish belief, the only image of God is man, one who lives and thinks; God has no visible shape, and it is absurd to make or worship images; instead man must worship the invisible God alone.<ref name=novak73/><ref></ref>
The commandments in the Hebrew Bible against idolatry forbade the practices and gods of ancient Akkad, Mesopotamia, and Egypt.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The Tanakh states that God has no shape or form, is utterly incomparable, is everywhere and cannot be represented in a physical form of an idol.<ref></ref>
Biblical scholars have historically focused on the textual evidence to construct the history of idolatry in Judaism, a scholarship that post-modern scholars have increasingly begun deconstructing.<ref name=janowitz239/> This biblical polemics, states Naomi Janowitz, a professor of Religious Studies, has distorted the reality of Israelite religious practices and the historic use of images in Judaism. The direct material evidence is more reliable, such as that from the archaeological sites, and this suggests that the Jewish religious practices have been far more complex than what biblical polemics suggest. Judaism included images and cultic statues in the First Temple period, the Second Temple period, Late Antiquity (2nd to 8th century CE), and thereafter.<ref name=janowitz239/><ref></ref> Nonetheless, these sorts of evidence may be simply descriptive of Ancient Israelite practices in some—possibly deviant—circles, but cannot tell us anything about the mainstream religion of the Bible which proscribes idolatry.<ref></ref>
The history of Jewish religious practice has included cult images and figurines made of ivory, terracotta, faience and seals.<ref name=janowitz239/><ref>Allen Shapiro (2011), urltoken Judean pillar figurines: a study, MA Thesis, Advisor: Barry Gittlen, Towson University, United States</ref> As more material evidence emerged, one proposal has been that Judaism oscillated between idolatry and iconoclasm. However, the dating of the objects and texts suggest that the two theologies and liturgical practices existed simultaneously. The claimed rejection of idolatry because of monotheism found in Jewish literature and therefrom in biblical Christian literature, states Janowitz, has been unreal abstraction and flawed construction of the actual history.<ref name=janowitz239/> The material evidence of images, statues and figurines taken together with the textual description of cherub and "wine standing for blood", for example, suggests that symbolism, making religious images, icon and index has been integral part of Judaism.<ref name=janowitz239/><ref></ref><ref name="Fine2001"></ref> Every religion has some objects that represent the divine and stand for something in the mind of the faithful, and Judaism too has had its holy objects and symbols such as the Menorah.<ref name=janowitz239></ref>

==Traditional religions==
===Africa===
Africa has numerous ethnic groups, and their diverse religious idea have been grouped as African Traditional Religions, sometimes abbreviated to ATR. These religions typically believe in a Supreme Being which goes by different regional names, as well as spirit world often linked to ancestors, and mystical magical powers through divination.<ref></ref> Idols and their worship have been associated with all three components in the African Traditional Religions.<ref></ref>
According to J.O. Awolalu, proselytizing Christians and Muslims have mislabelled idol to mean false god, when in the reality of most traditions of Africa, the object may be a piece of wood or iron or stone, yet it is "symbolic, an emblem and implies the spiritual idea which is worshipped".<ref name=awolalu1>J. O. Awolalu (1976), What is African Traditional Religion?, Studies in Comparative Religion, Vol. 10, No. 2, pages 8, 1–10</ref> The material objects may decay or get destroyed, the emblem may crumble or substituted, but the spiritual idea that it represents to the heart and mind of an African traditionalist remains unchanged.<ref name=awolalu1/> Sylvester Johnson – a professor of African American and Religious Studies, concurs with Awolalu, and states that the colonial era missionaries who arrived in Africa, neither understood the regional languages nor the African theology, and interpreted the images and ritualism as "epitome of idolatry", projecting the iconoclastic controversies in Europe they grew up with, onto Africa.<ref></ref>
First with the arrival of Islam in Africa, then during the Christian colonial efforts, the religiously justified wars, the colonial portrayal of idolatry as proof of savagery, the destruction of idols and the seizure of idolaters as slaves marked a long period of religious intolerance, which supported religious violence and demeaning caricature of the African Traditional Religionists.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> The violence against idolaters and idolatry of Traditional Religion practicers of Africa started in the medieval era and continued into the modern era.<ref></ref><ref name="Firestone1999p20"></ref><ref name="Gopin2002"></ref> The charge of idolatry by proselytizers, state Michael Wayne Cole and Rebecca Zorach, served to demonize and dehumanize local African populations, and justify their enslavement and abuse locally or far off plantations, settlements or for forced domestic labor.<ref name="ColeZorach2009p17">, Quote: "By negating African religious practices, the pejorative characterizations of these works as objects of idolatry served in vital ways to both demonize and dehumanize local populations, thereby providing a moral buttress for European religious and human trade practices on the continent".</ref><ref></ref>
===Americas===
Statues, images and temples have been a part of the Traditional Religions of the indigenous people of the Americas.<ref name=morill79/><ref name="Seaman2013p140"></ref><ref name=cole77></ref> The Incan, Mayan and Aztec civilizations developed sophisticated religious practices that incorporated idols and religious arts.<ref name=cole77/> The Inca Empire, for example, has believed in Viracocha (also called Pachacutec) as the creator deity and nature deities such as Inti (sun deity), and Mama Cocha the goddess of the sea, lakes, rivers and waters.<ref></ref><ref name=littleton726></ref><ref name="Roza2008p27"></ref>
In Mayan culture, Kukulkan has been the supreme creator deity, also revered as the god of reincarnation, water, fertility and wind.<ref name=littleton797/> The Mayan people built step pyramid temples to honor Kukulkan, aligning them to the Sun's position on the spring equinox.<ref name=littleton843></ref> Other deities found at Mayan archaeological sites include Xib Chac – the benevolent male rain deity, and Ixchel – the benevolent female earth, weaving and pregnancy goddess.<ref name=littleton843/> A deity with aspects similar to Kulkulkan in the Aztec culture has been called Quetzalcoatl.<ref name=littleton797></ref>
Missionaries came to the Americas with the start of Spanish colonial era, and the Catholic Church did not tolerate any form of native idolatry, preferring that the icons and images of Jesus and Mary replace the native idols.<ref name="Eire1989p5"/><ref></ref><ref name=morill79></ref> Aztec, for example, had a written history which included those about their Traditional Religion, but the Spanish colonialists destroyed this written history in their zeal to end what they considered as idolatry, and to convert the Aztecs to Catholicism. The Aztec Indians, however, preserved their religion and religious practices by burying their idols under the crosses, and then continuing their idol worship rituals and practices, aided by the syncretic composite of atrial crosses and their idols as before.<ref></ref>
During and after the imposition of Catholic Christianity during Spanish Empire, the Incan people retained their original beliefs in deities through syncretism, where they overlay the Christian God and teachings over their original beliefs and practices.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref name="kuznar2011p45"></ref> The male deity Inti became accepted as the Christian God, but the Andean rituals centered around idolatry of Incan deities have been retained and continued thereafter into the modern era by the Incan people.<ref name="kuznar2011p45"/><ref name="Brian M. Fagan 1996 345"></ref>
===Polynesia===
The Polynesians have had a range of polytheistic theologies found across the Pacific Ocean. The Polynesian people produced idols from wood, and congregated around these idols for worship.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
The Christian missionaries, particularly from the London Missionary Society such as John Williams, and others such as the Methodist Missionary Society, characterized these as idolatry, in the sense of islanders worshipping false gods. They sent back reports which primarily focussed on "overthrow of pagan idolatry" as evidence of their Christian sects triumph, with fewer mentions of actual converts and baptism.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
==False god or intolerance==
Yehezkel Kaufman (1960) states that the biblical prohibition of idolatry relates to the belief where the idols are considered gods. He adds that it is erroneous to assume that all idolatry was of this type, when in some cases, idols may have only been representations of gods. He cites a passage from 1 Kings 18:27, the Hebrew prophet Elijah challenges the priests of Baal atop of Mount Carmel to persuade their god to perform a miracle. The pagan priests beseeched their god without the use of an idol, which is evidence that Baal was not an idol, but rather one of the polytheistic gods that merely could be worshipped with or without the use of an idol.
The accusations and presumption that all idols and images are devoid of symbolism, or that icons of one's own religion are "true, healthy, uplifting, beautiful symbolism, mark of devotion, divine", while of other person's religion are "false, an illness, superstitious, grotesque madness, evil addiction, satanic and cause of all incivility" is more a matter of subjective personal interpretation, rather than objective impersonal truth.<ref name=janowitz239/> Allegations that idols only represent false gods, followed by violence and iconoclastic destruction, state Regina Schwartz and other scholars, is little more than religious intolerance.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The philosopher David Hume in his Dialogue on Religion, wrote that pagan idolatry is premised on pluralism, tolerance and acceptance of diverse representations of the divine, while monotheism has been intolerant, attempted to destroy freedom of expression and has violently forced others to accept and worship their singular view of the divine.<ref name=halbertal105></ref>

Idolatry is the worship of an idol or cult image, being a physical image, such as a statue, or a person in place of God.<ref name="Halbertal1992p1"/><ref>, Quote: "Idolatry (.) in the first commandment denotes the notion of worship, adoration, or reverence of an image of God."</ref><ref></ref> In Abrahamic religions, namely Judaism, Christianity and Islam, idolatry connotes the worship of something or someone other than God as if it were God. In these monotheistic religions, idolatry has been considered as the "worship of false gods" and is forbidden by the values such as the Ten Commandments.

The history of religions has been marked with accusations and denials of idolatry. These accusations have considered statues and images to be devoid of symbolism. Alternatively, the topic of idolatry has been a source of disagreements between many religions, or within denominations of various religions, with the presumption that icons of one's own religious practices have meaningful symbolism, while another person's different religious practices do not.<ref name=janowitz239/><ref name=halbertal105/>
