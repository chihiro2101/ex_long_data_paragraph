Jacob Aaron Westervelt

==Early life (1800–1817)==
Westervelt was the eldest son of Ari and Vrowti Westervelt. Ari Westervelt was a builder by occupation. He built several houses in Franklin Street, New York, and constructed the South Schraalenburgh Church in today's Bergenfield borough.<ref name="Westervelt"></ref><ref>Locate the church on urltoken "archiplanet.org" . Retrieved on March 14, 2009.</ref> Westervelt was born in Tenafly, New Jersey, on January 20, 1800, and was baptized at Schraalenburgh on February 16, being the first child to receive that sacrament after the completion of the new church. The Westervelts then resided at the old family homestead on Tenafly Road midway between Englewood and Tenafly. When Ari Westervelt was working on improving the riverfront, he moved, together with his infant son, to New York in 1804, to be nearer his work.<ref>The author of the article " urltoken Death of an ex-Mayor&nbsp;— career of Jacob A. Westervelt" in The New York Times wrote that the family moved to New York in 1804. Walter Tallman Westervelt wrote in his book that the Westervelts moved in 1805.</ref> It was to his father that Jacob Aaron owed his good education. His father died when Westervelt was only 14.<ref name="career" />
The sources differ as to Westervelt's further education and early career. He received additional education under the tutelage of James P. Forrester, then headmaster of the school connected with the Collegiate (Dutch) Church in New York, and was afforded greater educational opportunities under Barron & Brown, in a special course on surveying and navigation. Afterwards he went to sea, serving on ships for more than two years. He left the sea in 1817 and became an apprentice under Christian Bergh, a prosperous shipbuilder on the East River.<ref name="Westervelt" /> A differing source reports that he went to sea directly after his father's death,<ref name="dayton">Steamboat Days (1925), by Dayton, Fred Erving, chapter 19.</ref> while another states that he was already apprenticed to Christian Bergh in 1814.<ref name="career">" urltoken Death of an ex-Mayor&nbsp;— career of Jacob A.

==Christian Bergh's shipyard (1817–1836)==
Westervelt learned the "art, trade and mystery"<ref name="shipping" /> of his profession in a most independent way—as a teenage sailor and as an apprentice to Christian Bergh, for whom he worked at the very latest from the year 1817. Such was his talent that he was in Bergh's absolute confidence. Before even graduating from his apprenticeship, Westervelt accepted an offer to start business in Charleston, where he undertook the construction of two schooners, with the help of African American slaves from planters in and around Charleston (with his employer's consent).<ref name="dayton" /> He was so successful during those few months that he continued in business there, but he found the environment too confining for his ambitions and in 1822<ref name="Westervelt" /> he returned to New York, where he formed a partnership with Robert Carnley and his old master<ref name="dayton" /> under the name of C. Bergh & Co.<ref name="career" /> Some of the ships built by Bergh and Westervelt were Hope (1825), Henry IV (1826), Charlemagne (1828), Albany (1831), Philadelphia (1832), Utica (1833), Westminster (1835), and Toronto (1835). Christian Bergh retired a wealthy man in 1837,<ref>According to Fred Irving Dayton (Steamboat Days), Christian Bergh retired in 1835 (and not 1837), which can not be true, as there must have been a collaboration between Christian Bergh and his son Henry who went into business after 1835 (he matriculated in the class of 1834 at Columbia College, but left before graduating).</ref> and was succeeded by his sons Henry and Edwin Bergh, who continued the business until just after their father's death in 1843.<ref name="Morrison">History of New York ship yards (1909) by John Harrison Morrison, page 44, reprint by University of Michigan Library 2006, .</ref><ref name="care">Heritage of Care (2007) by Marion S. Lane, Stephen Zawistowski, Marty (FRW) Beck, page 3, .</ref>
==Westervelt & Co. shipyard (1836–1864)==
In 1836 Westervelt built at least two ships under his own name, the Baltimore and Mediator, in partnership with the 22-year-old ship chandler Marshall Owen Roberts as Westervelt & Roberts.<ref name="palmer"> urltoken "Palmer List of Merchant Vessels". Retrieved on March 28, 2009.

There are differing reports as to the start of this new chapter of Westervelt's life. On one side it is stated that Westervelt bought out his former partners Carnley and the Bergh brothers and took control of the Bergh shipyard,<ref> urltoken "Era of the clipper ships" by Donald Gunn Ross III.

Retrieved on March 29, 2009.</ref> Other sources state that Westervelt and William MacKay (not to be confused with Canadian shipbuilder Donald McKay) established one of a few new yards at Corlear's Hook (the block bounded by Third, Goerck and Houston Streets)<ref name="dayton" /> in 1841 and moved to Lewis and Seventh Street in 1844.<ref name="Morrison2">History of New York ship yards (1909) by John Harrison Morrison, pages 95–97, reprint by University of Michigan Library 2006, .</ref> Westervelt may also have designed and built ships in connection with Edward Mills.<ref name="dayton" /> 
The shipyard Westervelt & MacKay, later Westervelt & Sons (which Westervelt formed with his sons Aaron J. and Daniel),<ref name="era">The clipper ship era: an epitome of famous American and British clipper ships, their owners, builders, commanders, and crews, 1843–1869 (1910) by Arthur Hamilton Clark, page 48, .</ref> became prominent and prospered. Together with MacKay and his sons he built 50 steamships, 93 traditional sailing vessels and clippers, 5 barques, 14 schooners, one sloop, two lightships, and 11 pilot boats—a total of 181 vessels of 150,624&nbsp;tons.<ref name="dayton" /> 
Some of his noteworthy pilot boats are:
* Mary and Catharine (1848)<ref></ref> 
* Christian Bergh (1851)<ref></ref> 
* George W. Blunt (1856)<ref></ref> 
* Edwin Forrest (1855)<ref></ref>
* Abraham Leggett (1870)<ref></ref>
Westervelt built more vessels of medium tonnage than any builder of his time. 
Some of his noteworthy sailing packets are:
*The Constellation (1849), built for the Robert Kermit Red Star Line—1,534&nbsp;tons; 201&nbsp;feet 10&nbsp;inches x 41&nbsp;feet x 28&nbsp;feet (length x beam x depth of hold); 3 decks; draft 23&nbsp;feet. This was the largest sailing vessel in the New York–Liverpool packet service at that time. The Constellation carried between 800 and 900 steerage passengers per passage on the lower deck (the 912 steerage passengers she discharged on 29 May 1851 was a record at the time).<ref name="palmer" />

===Clipper ships===
Westervelt also built clippers, for example Contest (1852),<ref></ref> Hornet (1851),<ref></ref> N.B. Palmer (1851), Kathay (1853),<ref name="minnehaha"></ref> and . Clipper bows were distinctively narrow and heavily raked forward, allowing them to rapidly clip through the waves. The first archetypal clipper, with sharply raked stem, counter stern and square rig, was Ann McKim,<ref>" urltoken The Ann McKim". eraoftheclipperships.com. Retrieved on March 30, 2009.</ref> built in Baltimore in 1833<ref></ref> by Kennard & Williamson.<ref>Baltimore Republican and Commercial Advertiser, June 3, 1833.</ref> For some historians, the Rainbow<ref name = "vanmetre">
</ref> was the first true "Yankee clipper". She was built in 1845 to a new design by the American naval architect John W. Griffiths who is said to have based his design on the owner's previous ship Ann McKim.<ref name="bruzelius"></ref> This type of vessel had been in demand for the China trade, but they were rather small. From the experience gained in the service of these first clippers, the builder soon found the changes that were necessary in the design for the building of larger and faster ships demanded in 1850 for the California, China and Australia clipper routes.

====Westervelt's clippers====
The greatest New York clippers took shape in the yards of Westervelt and his friend William H. Webb.<ref name="annual" /><ref>" urltoken MIT Museum's Hart Nautical Collection Portrays the Romance and Reality of Clipper Ships" (PDF), MIT Museum press release from September 20, 2004, page 3. Retrieved on March 30, 2009.</ref> The N.B. Palmer was perhaps the most famous clipper built in the Westervelt yard, besides the Sweepstakes. In China she was known as "the Yacht", and with her nettings in the tops, brass guns, gold stripe, and her lavish entertainment on the Fourth of July and Washington's Birthday, she well deserved the title. A full-rigged model of the N.B. Palmer was exhibited at The Crystal Palace, London, in 1851, and attracted much attention as a fine example of the American clipper ship.<ref>The clipper ship era: an epitome of famous American and British clipper ships, their owners, builders, commanders, and crews, 1843–1869 (1910) by Arthur Hamilton Clark, page 162, .</ref> In 1858–1859 the N.B. Palmer with her 28-year-old Captain Hingham had tied the record of 82 days for the Shanghai to New York run.<ref name="minnehaha" /> The Sweepstakes, though black-hulled like other clippers, bore a stripe of gold, found on only a few others like the N.B. Palmer, and was praised for her sleek lines and speed. Sweepstakes (which was the last clipper to be built by the Westervelt shipyard) gained celebrity for her record-breaking seventy-four-day run from New York to Bombay in 1857,<ref name="mcny"></ref> and for making the trip between New York City and San Francisco in only 106 days.<ref></ref>
====The end of the clipper ship era====
The economic boom spurred on by the California Gold Rush that had brought on the era of the clipper ships had turned to bust. All the secrets of building lofty clippers had been discovered and there were too many of them in existence. The dropping freight rates now gave no incentive to build any more. The San Francisco market was so saturated that many a disgusted ship captain dumped unwanted cargo overboard in the bay before sailing on to other ports.<ref name="minnehaha" /> The diary of Robert Underhill, which recorded his 1856 travels on the Sweepstakes, revealed that Westervelt was also traveling on this voyage to San Francisco and the Orient. Underhill's entries made clear that Westervelt recognized the economic situation facing the port of New York and was seeking other possible venues for the family business.<ref name="mcny" />
By 1859 most of the extreme clippers had been dismasted more than once after half a decade or more of relentless hard driving. All were in a leaky condition, and most of their owners were by then in dire financial straits and could not afford expensive repairs to clippers that could not find a paying cargo to justify such expenses. Their masts were cut down, their yards shortened and their sails reduced as they were refitted and re-rigged with the new Howes rig to make them easier to handle by smaller crews. Other less fortunate clippers were discarded outright and sold for a pittance.<ref name="minnehaha" />
===Steamboats and steamships===
Some historians<ref>e.g. </ref> take the view that Westervelt built the first true American steamship that crossed the Atlantic to Europe. The Marquis Claude de Jouffroy from France invented and constructed the first steamboat, the so-called Palmipède, in 1774, and a second one, the steamboat , in 1783. Robert Fulton built the first commercially successful steam paddleship in the US, the (also known as Clermont) in 1807, using a Boulton and Watt engine.<ref name="science"></ref>
The is usually said to be the first steamship to cross the Atlantic (in 1819). She was originally planned as a sailing ship but was changed into a steamer. Because she did not make the entire passage under steam,<ref name="Gjenvik"></ref> some dispute the Savannahs claim as the pioneering ocean steamer of the Atlantic. The British steamer City of Kingston<ref name="Morrison4"></ref> and the , a Quebec-built craft,<ref name="Gjenvik" /> have been suggested as the first true steamers to make the crossing.
Three side-wheel steamers were also built in New York: the Lion and the Eagle (subsequently Regent and Congress), built in 1841 by Jacob Bell for the Spanish navy,<ref>History of New York ship yards (1909) by John Harrison Morrison, page 102, reprint by University of Michigan Library 2006, .</ref> and at about the same time the Kamschatka built by William H. Brown for the Russian navy. After the Savannah, there was no steamship owned or run by an American company that navigated the Atlantic Ocean to a port in Europe until 1847.<ref name="Morrison4" />
In 1846 began inquiries regarding the building of steamships for regularly scheduled transatlantic service. Edward Mills, a novice in the shipping business, led a syndicate that received the contract for mail delivery to Le Havre and Bremen for five years. With his associates C. H. Sand, Mortimer Livingston and John L. Stephens, he founded the Ocean Steam Navigation Company in May 1846.<ref name=morrison1903_p408>Morrison 1903, p. 408.</ref> The company was unable to attract sufficient capital to carry out its original business plan to build four ships and instead ordered two ships from Westervelt & MacKay, Washington and Hermann (1848).<ref name="Morrison2" /> The Westervelt shipyard built the hull, and the engines were made by Stillman, Allen & Co.<ref></ref> This was one of the less successful chapters in the history of the Westervelt shipyard. Both paddle steamers were said to be slow and had insufficient cargo space, and the government soon revoked the Le Havre portion of the mail contract because of the line's poor performance.<ref name="Morrison2" />
.<ref></ref>
===Warships and ships for governments===
By 1855, the gold rush was over and Westervelt, like other shipbuilders, began looking for new markets to keep his yard busy, as the shipping lines that had carried almost 2.7&nbsp;million emigrants across the Atlantic by sailing vessels between 1846–1855,were ordering fewer ships than before. The declining trend continued because of the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. Between 1855 and the end of the war in 1865, only 1.4&nbsp;million emigrants were conveyed from Europe to the United States.<ref name="Laakso"></ref>
On March 3, 1857 the U.S. Congress authorized five screw sloops of war, one of them the (the first ship so named by the U.S. Navy).<ref></ref> It was laid down later that year by Westervelt and his sons, launched in 1858, and commissioned on January 26, 1859 with Captain (later Admiral) David G. Farragut in command.<ref name="brooklyn"></ref> USS Brooklyn was active in Caribbean operations until the start of the American Civil War. In 1861 she was an active participant in the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America. She received orders for many different missions: she was one of the ships that attacked the Forts St. Philip and Jackson, and under the command of Captain James Alden, Jr. she was part of the fleet that helped to blockade Mobile Bay. During the battle of Mobile Bay, which lasted a little more than three hours, 54 of Brooklyns crew were killed and 43 wounded while firing 183 projectiles. After spending the next few weeks helping reduce the Confederate land works guarding the entrance, Brooklyn departed Mobile Bay on September 6, 1864 and headed for Hampton Roads for service in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Soon thereafter, Brooklyn was in the task force that arrived off Fort Fisher on January 13, 1865, and her guns supported the attack until the fort surrendered on January 15. Since this victory completed the last major task of the Union Navy during the Civil War, Brooklyn sailed north and was decommissioned at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on January 31, 1865.<ref name="civilwar"></ref> Admiral Farragut declared Brooklyn to have been the most efficient man-of-war in the American navy.<ref name="dayton" />
Besides the Brooklyn, also built at the Westervelt shipyard were the gunboats , and the revenue cutter , all of which performed efficient blockading services during the war. Westervelt also built many vessels for foreign governments, among these the frigate Hope in 1825 for the Greek government, Guadalquiver for Spain, and Eusiyama for Japan. Westervelt was awarded the Order of Isabella the Catholic by the Queen of Spain for the preparation of models and plans for three Spanish frigates.<ref name="Westervelt" /><ref name="shipping" />
===Postwar slump and closure (1861–1868)===
The most successful year for Westervelts's yard was 1858 when 12 ships were built (aggregating 14,081&nbsp;tons). At the outbreak of the Civil War, Westervelt was one of the richest shipowners in the country. He was a supporter of the Union cause. President Abraham Lincoln esteemed his judgment highly, and entrusted him with the purchase of many of the river craft which were altered to suit the demands of Blockade and transport service. Westervelt accepted nothing for such service, but contented himself with the profits accruing from his shipyard. It was during this period that his fortune shrank very much faster than it had been accumulated. Steamer after steamer was wrecked, burned or captured by Confederate cruisers, until at the close of the war he was almost bankrupt. During one year alone his losses from marine casualties amounted to $500,000.<ref name="career" />
After the end of the Civil War in 1865, the U.S. government auctioned off the hundreds of ships it had requisitioned during the war at firesale prices, depressing the market and leaving American shipyards with no work. The result was that most American shipyards, along with marine engine specialists, failed. Not only the Westervelt shipyard, but the whole shipbuilding industry in New York was badly affected by the slump, being practically wiped out in the ensuing years. As the demise of shipbuilding after the war afforded him little opportunity to recover from his losses, the firm was dissolved in 1868, with no large surplus of assets. By this time Westervelt had constructed 247 ships with his partners, more than any other American shipbuilder in his day.<ref name="career" />
==Dock Commissioner (1870–1879)==
When the Dock Department was created in 1870, Wilson G. Hunt prevailed upon Westervelt to accept the duties of Superintendent of the Department. His management was characterized by prudence, sagacity and honesty.<ref name="career" /> When William Frederick Havemeyer became Mayor in 1873,<ref name="mayor" /> Westervelt was appointed a Commissioner of Docks and at the same time elected President of the Board of Dock Commissioners<ref></ref> (which position he also held at the time of his death),<ref name="career" /> and as such made tremendous improvements in piers and docks. His chief engineer, whom he selected in July 1870, was General George B. McClellan,<ref>" urltoken A brief history of the early years of the department of docks (1989)" (PDF) by Richard M. Casella, page 3 (found on the website of urltoken "historicdoc.com"). Retrieved on March 24, 2009.</ref> and his secretary General was Louis Fitzgerald.<ref name="annual" /> In 1875 George S. Greene Jr. became the new chief engineer.<ref>" urltoken A brief history of the early years of the department of docks (1989)" (PDF) by Richard M. Casella, page 7 (found on the website of urltoken "historicdoc.com"). Retrieved on March 24, 2009.</ref>
As Dock Commissioner, Westervelt followed in the footsteps of his father by continuing to improve the riverfront.<ref name="nytdocks"></ref><ref></ref>
In 1873 the Drafter and engineers in the office of the Engineer-in-Chief were engaged in the preparation of maps and drawings to show the Land grant under water, around, and adjoining the island of Manhattan which had been made by either the state or Municipal governments from 1696 till 1873. They were also been engaged in the preparation of plans for a proposed exterior bulkhead wall which was planned to be built all around the city.<ref name="nytdocks" />
A new dock system was also proposed of which the main feature was a wide river street encircling the waterfront to afford ample accommodation for the movement of freight and its transportation by rail. The new river and sea wall was to be constructed of granite and a Beton concrete, composed of Portland cement and broken stone. From this wall projecting into the river were a series of piers constructed of wood, iron, and stone. The large concrete blocks used in the construction of the new river wall were manufactured at the yards of the Dock Commission in Gansevoort Street, Manhattan. Two to three blocks, of forty to fifty tons each, were made daily.<ref name="nytdocks" /> Westervelt was closely involved in these improvements.
==Political career==
===Start in politics (1840–1852)===
Westervelt was politically an ardent but not very active Democrat. In 1840 he was elected to the Common Council,<ref name="career" /> in which he served for two years as an Alderman from the thirteenth ward.<ref name="annual">Eighteenth Annual Report (1920) from the Bergen County Historical Society, Hackensack, New Jersey (number 13, pages 61–62).</ref> Westervelt stepped back from active political involvement for a couple of years, but remained a shrewd observer of current affairs and recognized nuisances and the needs of the people of "his" town. He witnessed sharply increasing taxes between 1850 and 1852 and the establishment of a reform movement that began to decry excessive government spending. Grand jury revelations of widespread corruption on the common council heightened such concerns. Reformers mobilized and ran the Democratic incumbents out of office, electing in their place a combination of Whigs and reform Democrats committed to "economy" in government.<ref name="park"></ref> In November 1852 Westervelt was nominated for Mayor of the city by reformist representatives of the Democratic party. The mayoralty election was held at the same time as the presidential election, and the Democrats were successful in both.<ref name="Westervelt" />
===Election as Mayor (1853–1855) and political goals===
Westervelt was elected by a majority of 10,000, the largest ever received by a candidate up to that time (being nearly as much indebted to Whigs as to Democrats for his seat),<ref name="career" /> against the most popular member of the Whig party, Alderman Morgan Morgans, carrying his own ward by a majority of nearly 1,000, and only a few votes behind the electoral ticket for President Franklin Pierce.<ref name="Westervelt" /> The new mayor inherited the bad financial situation of the city, corrupt politicians, and an ailing police system. In his first message<ref name="message"></ref> to the Community Council he declared the subjects he planned to deal with first, and that according to him, needed the attention of the council:<ref name="message" />
===Mayor Westervelt and the police===
Westervelt's term was marked by many reforms of the city's police.<ref name="career" /> One of the most controversial was his attempt to enforce a police uniform.<ref name="uniform"></ref>
In 1844, New York City's population of 320,000 was served by an archaic police force, consisting of one night watch, one hundred city marshals, thirty-one constables, and fifty-one municipal police officers.<ref name="lankevich">American Metropolis: A History of New York City (1998) by George L. Lankevich, pages 84–85, .</ref> On 7 May 1844, the state legislature approved a proposal that authorized creation of a city police force, along with abolition of the nightwatch system.<ref name="lankevich"/> Under Mayor William Havemeyer, the NYPD was reorganized on May 13, 1845, with the city divided into three districts, with courts, magistrates, and clerks, and station houses.<ref name="lankevich"/> Within eight years this system showed weaknesses. The New York Times wrote in 1853, "Our police are inefficient. Worse has been said of them."<ref name="uniform" /> Another publication delineated the situation much more precisely:
It was Mayor Westervelt's stated aim to sort out the bad seed.<ref name="badseed">Examples of such occurrences in the article " urltoken Meeting of the Board of Police Commissioners" in The New York Times from September 27, 1853, page 3. Retrieved on March 24, 2009.</ref> In 1853 an administrative body was created, called the Board of Police Commissioners, consisting of Mayor Westervelt, the recorder and the city judge. Apart from the fact that the chief of police was selected by the Mayor with the Board's approval, the Board had full powers of appointment and dismissal of all members of the force and was charged with general administrative duties.<ref name="policesystem">American Police Systems (1920) by Raymond B. Fosdick (Raymond Blaine), pages 67–69, .</ref>
In nothing was the undisciplined attitude of the police more clearly shown than in their refusal to wear uniforms. "Un-American", "undemocratic", "militarism", "King's livery", "a badge of degradation and servitude"—ideas of this kind formed the basis of opposition against Westervelt's wish to put policemen in uniform,<ref name="policesystem" /> mainly from the force itself and an influential number of citizens who deemed it "unrepublican" to put the servants of the city in livery.<ref name="career" /> On June 24, 1854 there was a large, angry meeting of 1,000–1,500 policemen. The objects of the meeting were stated in a notice posted prominently in the streets and published in the morning papers:
Westervelt's position was clear: that a uniform incites a high degree of chivalry sentiment, that it involves a "pride of cloth", and that the wearer knows that if he disgraces it he disgraces himself and the profession in which he serves.<ref name="uniform" /> Westervelt earned many party enemies by his determined policy to keep appointments to the police force, which were then a large part of the patronage appertaining to the mayoralty, free from political influence.<ref name="career" />
===Mayor Westervelt's influence on tourism===
By the early 1850s New York had grown to sufficient size and prominence that the city decided to host a major exhibition of the type that London had pioneered in 1851.<ref>The Great Exhibition of 1851: A Nation on Display by Jeffrey A. Auerbach, Yale University Press, 1999, .</ref> Such early exhibitions were forerunners of the later world's fairs. The Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations opened during the term of Mayor Westervelt on July 14, 1853, in a sparsely developed part of the city. Fortieth and Forty-second streets bounded the fair's four-acre site to the immediate west of the Croton Distributing Reservoir—today's Bryant Park. Within New York's Crystal Palace, designed by Karl Gildemeister, four thousand exhibitors displayed the industrial wares, consumer goods, and artworks of the nation.<ref name="cityhistory">History of the city of New York: its origin, rise and progress by Martha J. Lamb & Burton Harrison, pages 358–359.</ref> Westervelt was President of the Exhibition,<ref name="annual" /> which set off one of the first major Tourism in New York City; many hotels were built to handle the influx of visitors. Over one million people visited the Crystal Palace Exhibition, which closed on November 1, 1854 (in spite of its popularity, the exhibition's sponsors lost $300,000 on the venture). The structure remained standing after the fair, and was leased for a variety of purposes before being destroyed by fire on October 5, 1858.<ref name="cityhistory" />
===Controversial opinions===
====Proposed reduction of Central Park====
Mayor Westervelt did not shy away from unpopular decisions if he considered them to serve the general good. In 1853 the New York legislature designated a area from 59th to 106th Streets for the creation of the planned Central Park, though the land alone cost over $5&nbsp;million. At the time, the city's finances were declining, and Westervelt was concerned about overspending and the state's regulatory overreach in its decision to designate such a large area. There were several competing proposals to curtail the park, but no decision was made until March 1855, when the city's board of councilmen voted 14-to-3 to trim both the lower thirteen blocks (from 59th to 72nd Streets) and four hundred feet from each side of Central Park. However, on March 23, 1855, the new Democratic Mayor, Fernando Wood, vetoed the measure.<ref name="park" />
====Riots====
The New York Draft Riots, the worst riots in United States history with respect to lives lost, took place during the Civil War in 1863, when immigrant factory workers forcibly resisted the federal government's military draft. In the United States, the period from 1820–1870 was generally characterized by conflicts on the domestic front, such as the police riots and the riots of the Know-Nothing movement.<ref></ref> It was during Westervelt's term as mayor that some of the first Know-Nothing riots occurred.<ref name="career" /> This nativist American political movement was empowered by popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by Irish Catholic immigrants, who were often regarded as hostile to American values and controlled by the Pope in Rome.<ref name="advent"></ref> This body of thought was often propagated by street preachers. One of the most ambivalent characters was Reverend Mr. Parsons, who had been in the habit of regularly preaching on the wharves, in shipyards and other "obscure" places along the East and North Rivers. On December 11, 1853 he planted himself upon a pile of timber in the Westervelt & MacKay shipyard.<ref name="Parsons"></ref> His voice traveled far, and in the course of half an hour there was an assemblage of some ten thousand people. As a result of his speech a serious riot occurred and on the orders of Mayor Westervelt the preacher was taken into custody. Some Know-Nothinger hastened to the station house with the intention of liberating him. Finding no redress there, five thousand excited men marched to 308 East Broadway and surrounded the residence of Mayor Westervelt. Finding that he was absent from home,<ref name="Parsons" /> they contented themselves with daubing a large cross on the door.<ref name="career" /><ref>According to Arthur Hamilton Clark (The clipper ship era: an epitome of famous American and British clipper ships) the front door of Jacob Aaron Westervelt's house in East Broadway was ornamented with a carved stone cap representing the stern of a packet ship.</ref>
The feelings of the members of this movement against the participation of foreign-born citizens in municipal affairs had grown very bitter,<ref name="advent" /> and Westervelt set himself so sternly against them that his house was mobbed again.<ref name="career" /> Probably due to the paucity of support for his reformist efforts during his term, but also because he applied himself more and more to the business of shipbuilding again, Westervelt declined a renomination, which for him was equivalent to an election, and was succeeded as Mayor by Fernando Wood.<ref name="Westervelt" /> In 1857 Westervelt became a member of the New York State Assembly for Rockland County.<ref></ref>
==Genealogy of the Westervelt family==
===Ancestors===
Westervelt, as his name indicates, came from old Dutch stock.<ref name="career" /> The name was known in the Netherlands at a very early period, and although the family members were not of nobility, they had been extensive property owners for many generations. The earliest mention of the Westervelts that has been recorded is of a Dirk van Westervelt and his family who resided in and around the town of Harderwijk for many years. Some individuals sharing that name appear to have been early inhabitants of Zwolle, and their descendants are still to be found there, known by the name Westerveld.<ref name="Westervelt2">Genealogy of the Westervelt family, by Walter Tallman Westervelt, pages 1–2.</ref>
In the middle of the 17th century a few Westervelts lived in Meppel, situated a few miles from the eastern shore of the Zuiderzee, in the province of Drenthe and three miles east of Zwolle. Amongst them were two brothers, Willem and Lubbert Lubbertsen van Westervelt, both farmers and cattle raisers, who with their wives and children decided to move to the New World.<ref name="Westervelt2" /> They left Amsterdam on board ("Hope") on April 8, 1662. On their arrival on May 24, 1662, New Amsterdam (which later became New York City) was suffering from a prolonged drought as no rain had fallen for eighty consecutive days.<ref name="Westervelt2" /> Lubbert settled near Hackensack, New Jersey and was one of the promoters of the Dutch Church organized there in 1686. Willem was a member of the Marble Collegiate Church in New Amsterdam (1667), whilst his son lived at New Utrecht on Long Island. This son sold his lands in 1706 and is supposed to have moved to New Jersey, where the family has been numerous and prominent for the past 300&nbsp;years.<ref name="career" /> William Lubbertsen van Westervelt with his wife and six children, and Lubbert Lubbertsen van Westervelt, with his wife and four children, became the progenitors of the van Westervelt/Westervelt family in America, and were at one time the second largest family in Bergen County, New Jersey.<ref name="Westervelt2" /> Jacob Aaron Westervelt was a seventh-generation descendant of Lubbert Lubbertsen van Westervelt.<ref name="career" />
