The first college to open its doors within the town of Greensboro was the woman's college, Greensboro Female College.

Through the Methodist Church, a charter was secured in 1838, an event which makes the college Timeline of women's colleges in the United States. The college became coeducational in the late 1950s.
The cornerstone of the first building was laid in 1843, and in 1846 the institution opened its doors to students. Young women came from many southern states to become the first classes of the new president, the Rev. Solomon Lea, and his faculty.<ref>Arnett, Ethel Stephens.
