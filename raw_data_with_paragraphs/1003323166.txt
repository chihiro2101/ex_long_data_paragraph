Sea Change (album)

==Background==
Following Beck's tour for his Midnite Vultures album, Beck and his fianc√©e, stylist Leigh Limon, ended their nine-year relationship. Three weeks before Beck's 30th birthday, he discovered Limon had been having an affair with a member of Los Angeles band Whiskey Biscuit.<ref name="age"></ref> Beck lapsed into a period of melancholy and introspection, during which he wrote the bleak, acoustic-based tracks on Sea Change.<ref name="heartbreak"></ref> He wrote most of the album's 12 songs in one week, but shelved them. "Songs sit in my head for a while," he told Time in 2002. "I have dozens in there, songs from eight years ago that I've written but never recorded. After a while, I just sort of decide to record them."<ref name="time"></ref> Beck also strayed from the songs to keep from talking about his personal life, as well as to focus on music and "not really strew my baggage across the public lobby." Eventually, however, he found the songs speak to an experience (a relationship breakup) that is common, and that it would not seem self-indulgent to record them.<ref name="beckchecksin"></ref> In 2001, Beck drifted back to the songs and called his frequent producer, Nigel Godrich.<ref name="time"/>
Beck intended to record the album in late 2001, but due to the September 11 attacks, "it took a while for people to line up."<ref name="shipinabottle"/> Before working with Godrich, Beck recorded tracks with Dan the Automator in January 2002 in preparation for the new record,<ref name="beckoners"></ref> but no songs from those sessions were used for Sea Change.<ref name="completion"></ref> Many songs, such as "Lost Cause", were performed live prior to the album's recording. Another new song, "Evil Things", was also performed and demoed but ultimately not recorded for the album, due to loss of time.<ref name="beckenters"/> Regarding the performances of more personal tracks in the days before Sea Change, Beck explained in a 2008 interview that "Those were the kinds of songs I would play in the middle of the show. I'd try to throw a couple of them in. I just remember the audience kind of disregarding them, or moshing, or throwing things. Just because those were the kinds of persons that came out."<ref name="pitchfork" />
==Recording and production==
Beck and his group of musicians entered the studio with intentions to make the record an acoustic-based offering, in the vein of those for his emotive 1998 disc Mutations. Early in the recording process, Beck told Godrich that he was hoping to record one track per day, similar to the process of Mutations. However, each song ended up taking at least two days to record, due to orchestral arrangements.<ref name="shipinabottle"/> Musical partners in the studio included multi-instrumentalist Jon Brion, drummer James Gadson, and guitarist Jason Falkner, as well as longtime musical partners, keyboardist Roger Joseph Manning Jr., bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen, drummer Joey Waronker, guitarist Smokey Hormel, and cellist Suzie Katayama.<ref name="beckoners"/> In addition, Beck's father, David Campbell, provided string arrangements.<ref name="completion"/> Joey Waronker left mid-way through recording for Hawaii; James Gadson filled in for him the remaining days.<ref name="shipinabottle"/>
Recording began as soon as the band entered Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles on March 6, 2002.<ref name="beckenters"></ref> Much of Sea Change was recorded live, with extra effects (including bells and strings) added later.<ref name="heartbreak"/> In order to capture the immediacy of the material, the artists worked quickly and spontaneously, frequently laying second takes of songs to disc.<ref name="heartbreak"/> During production, Beck realized his singing voice had gotten significantly deeper. "Before we recorded," said Godrich, "We listened to Mutations, and his voice sounded like Mickey Mouse. His range has dropped. Now when he opens his mouth, a canyonesque vibration comes out. It's quite remarkable. He has amazing tone."<ref name="time"/>
By the end of production, the group of musicians had to work faster than they intended. "We kind of ran out of time at the end," said Beck. "Joni Mitchell was coming in to do her record, but she works very civilized and she takes the weekend off, so we were sneaking in on the weekends and trying to finish."<ref name="heartbreak"/> Eventually, recording lasted a little over three weeks and the album was mixed from there on, which was completed May 7.<ref name="shipinabottle"/><ref name="completion"/> At one session, Hansen began strumming his 1995 single "It's All in Your Mind" randomly before beginning a new song, and Godrich became ecstatic, remarking "We have to do that." The strikingly different re-recorded version appears on Sea Change as an "evolved song", according to Hansen.<ref name="shipinabottle"/>
"Ship in the Bottle" was the only completed track left off the record. "That was the super-pop song of the record," said Beck in a 2002 interview. "I think it was a little too corny. I mean, it was heartfelt, but since then people have been telling me they really liked it. I think we felt that the album was so long already. I don't know what the fate of that will be."<ref name="shipinabottle"></ref> "Ship in the Bottle" was released on the Japanese version of Sea Change and later remasters.<ref name="ship"></ref>
==Music==
Sea Change is based around a musical suite of reflective, acoustic-based songs that showcase Beck's singer-songwriter side.<ref name="completion"/> The term sea change is defined as a broad transformation, which reflects the departure in style from both Beck's previous effort Midnite Vultures and previous, sample-based recordings, as well as Beck's desire to give each album an identity.<ref name="tour1"/> Origins for the album's unique, passionate sound had been building up for years, according to Beck in a 2002 interview: "There are threads of what I've done before. If you listen to my earlier B- sides, you'll hear this record. I have been wanting to make this record for years," he explained. "I've been edging towards the idea, and so it just took a while."<ref name="tour1"></ref> Despite initial difficulty upon deciding on the name, the title originates from "Little One", the eleventh track on the album: "Drown, drown / Sailors run aground / In a sea change nothing is safe".<ref name="tour1"/>
The recordings from Sea Change sessions include themes of heartbreak and desolation, solitude and loneliness.<ref name="usatoday"></ref> Although often compared to Mutations, Beck himself regarded the album, in a 2008 interview, as more representative of his 1994 album One Foot in the Grave and "more representative of what I was doing in the early days."<ref name="pitchfork"/>
==Promotion and release==
Before release, retailers worried about the commercial impact of Sea Change due to its sound. Analysts predicted the album would not receive heavy radio support, noting that Beck's reputation, critical acclaim and the possibility of multiple Grammy nominations might offset an uncommercial sound.<ref name="beckchecksin"/> "It's a really beautiful album, but it's going to appeal to a different audience than he's had before," said Vince Szydlowski, senior director of product for the Virgin Megastore chain, shortly before the release of Sea Change. "If you're used to the 'Where It's At (Beck song)' Beck, then this isn't the record for you. I think it'll go gold, but it'll struggle beyond gold."<ref name="beckchecksin"/> The album's release date was announced May 31, 2002. In addition, the album's initial track listing was also released, featuring songs in a very different order than their final version, as well as including the track "Ship in the Bottle".<ref name="completion"/> The album's title was announced in August 2002.<ref name="flaminglips"/> In promotion of the record, new tracks from the record were released in chronological order by track listing weekly through Beck's website in July and August, 2002.<ref name="becktour"/>
Sea Change was released September 24, 2002.
Around the time of release of the album, there was a four-track sampler named 'Sea Change Album Sampler'. It was packaged like a CD single and contained the following tracks:

Sea Change is the eighth studio album by American musician Beck, released on September 24, 2002 by Geffen Records. Recorded over a two-month period in Los Angeles with producer Nigel Godrich, the album features themes of heartbreak and desolation, solitude, and loneliness. For the album, much of Beck's trademark cryptic and ironic lyrics were replaced by simpler, more sincere lyrical content. He also eschewed the heavy sampling of his previous albums for live instrumentation. Beck cited the breakup with his longtime girlfriend as the major influence on the album.
Sea Change peaked at number 8 on the Billboard 200, later being certified gold in 2005 by the RIAA. It was met with favorable responses from critics, who considered Beck's transition from sonically experimental work to emotionally charged balladry to be successful and convincing. The album later appeared in many publications' lists of the best albums of the 2000s,<ref name="Acclaimed Music - Beck"></ref> and is today one of Beck's best-reviewed recordings.<ref name="Acclaimed Music - Beck"/> "Lost Cause" and "Guess I'm Doing Fine" were released as singles.
