Ambisonics

== Introduction ==
Ambisonics can be understood as a three-dimensional extension of M/S (mid/side) stereo, adding additional difference channels for height and depth. The resulting signal set is called B-format. Its component channels are labelled <math>W</math> for the sound pressure (the M in M/S), <math>X</math> for the front-minus-back sound pressure gradient, <math>Y</math> for left-minus-right (the S in M/S) and <math>Z</math> for up-minus-down.<ref group="note">The traditional B-format notation is used in this introductory paragraph, since it is assumed that the reader may have come across it already. For higher-order Ambisonics, use of the ACN notation is recommended.</ref>
The <math>W</math> signal corresponds to an omnidirectional microphone, whereas <math>XYZ</math> are the components that would be picked up by figure-of-eight capsules oriented along the three spatial axes.
=== Panning a source ===
A simple Ambisonic panner (or encoder) takes a source signal <math>S</math> and two parameters, the horizontal angle <math>\theta</math> and the elevation angle <math>\phi</math>. It positions the source at the desired angle by distributing the signal over the Ambisonic components with different gains:
:<math>W=S \cdot \frac</ref> is a commercially available 32-channel, ambisonic microphone array.
Due to the aggressive equalisation necessary, the timbral and noise performance of higher-order arrays is not currently comparable to traditional high-quality recording microphones, and the resulting B-format is increasingly band-limited towards higher orders, raising issues of up- and downwards compatibility.
A recent paper by Peter Craven et al.<ref>P G Craven, M J Law, and C Travis, urltoken Microphone arrays using tangential velocity sensors , Ambisonics Symposium, Graz 2009</ref> (subsequently patented) describes the use of bi-directional capsules for higher order microphones to reduce the extremity of the equalisation involved. No microphones have yet been made using this idea.
=== Ambisonic panning ===
The most straightforward way to produce Ambisonic mixes of arbitrarily high order is to take monophonic sources and position them with an Ambisonic encoder.
A full-sphere encoder usually has two parameters, azimuth (or horizon) and elevation angle. The encoder will distribute the source signal to the Ambisonic components such that, when decoded, the source will appear at the desired location.
More sophisticated panners will additionally provide a radius parameter that will take care of distance-dependent attenuation and bass boost due to near-field effect.
Hardware panning units and mixers for first-order Ambisonics have been available since the 1980s<ref>Michael A Gerzon and Geoffrey J Barton, Ambisonic Surround-Sound Mixing for Multitrack Studios, AES Preprint C1009, 2nd International Conference: The Art and Technology of Recording May 1984. urltoken Elen, urltoken Ambisonic mixing – an introduction, Studio Sound, September 1983</ref><ref>Nigel Branwell, urltoken Ambisonic Surround-Sound Technology for Recording and Broadcast, Recording Engineer/Producer, December 1983</ref> and have been used commercially.
Today, panning plugins and other related software tools are available for all major digital audio workstations, often as free software. However, due to arbitrary bus width restrictions, few professional digital audio workstations (DAW) support orders higher than second. Notable exceptions are REAPER, Pyramix, ProTools, Nuendo and Ardour.
=== Ambisonic manipulation ===
First order B-format can be manipulated in various ways to change the contents of an auditory scene. Well known manipulations include "rotation" and "dominance" (moving sources towards or away from a particular direction).<ref name="aes.org"/><ref>Dave G. Malham, urltoken Spatial Heading Mechanisms and Sound Reproduction 1998, retrieved 2014-01-24</ref>
Additionally, linear time-invariant signal processing such as equalisation can be applied to B-format without disrupting sound directions, as long as it applied to all component channels equally.
More recent developments in higher order Ambisonics enable a wide range of manipulations including rotation, reflection, movement, 3D reverb, upmixing from legacy formats such as 5.1 or first order, visualisation and directionally-dependent masking and equalisation.
=== Data exchange ===
Transmitting Ambisonic B-format between devices and to end-users requires a standardized exchange format. While traditional first-order B-format is well-defined and universally understood, there are conflicting conventions for Higher-order Ambisonics, differing both in channel order and weighting, which might need to be supported for some time. Traditionally, the most widespread is Furse-Malham higher order format in the <code>.amb</code> container based on Microsoft's WAVE-EX file format.<ref name=".AMB">Richard Dobson urltoken The AMB Ambisonic File Format </ref> It scales up to third order and has a file size limitation of 4GB.
New implementations and productions might want to consider the AmbiX<ref>Christian Nachbar, Franz Zotter, Etienne Deleflie, and Alois Sontacchi: urltoken AmbiX - A Suggested Ambisonics Format Ambisonics Symposium 2011, Lexington (KY) 2011</ref> proposal, which adopts the <code>.caf</code> file format and does away with the 4GB limit. It scales to arbitrarily high orders and is based on SN3D encoding. SN3D encoding has been adopted by Google as the basis for its YouTube 360 format.<ref>YouTube Help, urltoken Use spatial audio in 360-degree and VR videos</ref>

Dolby Laboratories have expressed "interest" in Ambisonics by acquiring (and liquidating) Barcelona-based Ambisonics specialist imm sound prior to launching Dolby Atmos,<ref></ref> which, although its precise workings are undisclosed, does implement decoupling between source direction and actual loudspeaker positions. Atmos takes a fundamentally different approach in that it does not attempt to transmit a sound field; it transmits discrete premixes or stems (i.e., raw streams of sound data) along with metadata about what location and direction they should appear to be coming from. The stems are then decoded, mixed, and rendered in real time using whatever loudspeakers are available at the playback location.
=== Use in gaming ===
Higher-order Ambisonics has found a niche market in video games developed by Codemasters. Their first game to use an Ambisonic audio engine was Colin McRae: DiRT, however, this only used Ambisonics on the PlayStation 3 platform.<ref>
</ref> Their game Race Driver: GRID extended the use of Ambisonics to the Xbox 360 platform,<ref></ref> and Colin McRae: DiRT 2 uses Ambisonics on all platforms including the PC.<ref></ref>
The recent games from Codemasters, F1 2010, Dirt 3,<ref></ref> F1 2011<ref></ref> and Dirt: Showdown,<ref></ref> use fourth-order Ambisonics on faster PCs,<ref></ref> rendered by Blue Ripple Sound's Rapture3D OpenAL driver and pre-mixed Ambisonic audio produced using Bruce Wiggins' WigWare Ambisonic Plug-ins.<ref></ref>
== Patents and trademarks ==
Most of the patents covering Ambisonic developments have now expired (including those covering the Soundfield microphone) and, as a result, the basic technology is available for anyone to implement. Exceptions to this include Dr Geoffrey Barton's Trifield technology, which is a three-speaker stereo rendering system based on Ambisonic theory , and so-called "Vienna" decoders, based on Gerzon and Barton's Vienna 1992 AES paper, which are intended for decoding to irregular speaker arrays .
The "pool" of patents comprising Ambisonics technology was originally assembled by the UK Government's National Research & Development Corporation (NRDC), which existed until the late 1970s to develop and promote British inventions and license them to commercial manufacturers – ideally to a single licensee. The system was ultimately licensed to Nimbus Records (now owned by Wyastone Estate Ltd).
The "interlocking circles" Ambisonic logo (UK trademarks and 
, and the text marks "AMBISONIC" and "A M B I S O N" (UK trademarks and 
, formerly owned by Wyastone Estate Ltd., have expired as of 2010.

Ambisonics is a full-sphere surround sound format: in addition to the horizontal plane, it covers sound sources above and below the listener.<ref>Michael A. Gerzon, Periphony: With-Height Sound Reproduction. Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, 1973, 21(1):2–10.</ref>
Unlike other multichannel surround formats, its transmission channels do not carry speaker signals. Instead, they contain a speaker-independent representation of a sound field called B-format, which is then decoded to the listener's speaker setup. This extra step allows the producer to think in terms of source directions rather than loudspeaker positions, and offers the listener a considerable degree of flexibility as to the layout and number of speakers used for playback.
Ambisonics was developed in the UK in the 1970s under the auspices of the British National Research Development Corporation.
Despite its solid technical foundation and many advantages, Ambisonics had not until recently been a commercial success, and survived only in niche applications and among recording enthusiasts.
With the easy availability of powerful digital signal processing (as opposed to the expensive and error-prone analog circuitry that had to be used during its early years) and the successful market introduction of home theatre surround sound systems since the 1990s, interest in Ambisonics among recording engineers, sound designers, composers, media companies, broadcasters and researchers has returned and continues to increase.
