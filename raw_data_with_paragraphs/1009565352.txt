Mount Kilimanjaro

==Fauna and flora==
===Animals===
Large animals are rare on Kilimanjaro and are more frequent in the forests and lower parts of the mountain. Elephants and Cape buffaloes are among the animals that can be potentially hazardous to trekkers. Bushbucks, chameleons, dik-diks, duikers, mongooses, sunbirds, and warthogs have also been reported. Zebras, leopards and hyenas have been observed sporadically on the Shira plateau.<ref></ref> Specific species associated with the mountain include the Kilimanjaro shrew<ref></ref> and the chameleon Kinyongia tavetana.<ref></ref>
=== Vegetation===
Natural forests cover about on Kilimanjaro.<ref name="PlantEcology"></ref> In the foothill area maize, beans, sunflowers and, on the western side, wheat are cultivated. Remnants of the former savanna vegetation with Acacia, Combretum, Terminalia and Grewia also occur. Between and , coffee also appears as part of the "Chagga home gardens" agroforestry. Native vegetation at this altitude range (Strombosia, Newtonia, and Entandrophragma) is limited to inaccessible valleys and gorges<ref name="MaundiCrater"></ref> and is completely different from vegetation at higher altitudes. On the southern slope montane forests first contain Ocotea usambarensis as well as ferns and epiphytes, farther up in cloud forests Podocarpus latifolius, Hagenia abyssinica and Erica excelsa grow as well as fog-dependent mosses. On the drier northern slopes olive, Croton-Calodendrum, Cassipourea, and Juniperus form forests in order of increasing altitude. Between and lie Erica bush and heathlands, followed by Helichrysum until .<ref name="PlantEcology2"/><ref></ref> Neophytes have been observed, including Poa annua.<ref name="PlantEcology2"></ref>
Records from the Maundi crater at indicate that the vegetation of Kilimanjaro has varied over time. Forest vegetation retreated during the Last Glacial Maximum and the ericaceous vegetation belt lowered by between 42,000 and 30,000 years ago because of the drier and colder conditions.<ref name="MaundiCrater"/>
The Tussock Grassland is an area on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro that contains many unique species of vegetation such as the water holding cabbage.
== Climate ==
The climate of Kilimanjaro is influenced by the height of the mountain, which allows the simultaneous influence of the equatorial trade winds and the high altitude anti-trades; and by the isolated position of the mountain. Kilimanjaro has Mountain breeze and valley breeze, a regimen stronger on the southern than the northern side of the mountain. The flatter southern flanks are more extended and affect the atmosphere more strongly.<ref name="AnAscentOfKilimanjaro"/>
Kilimanjaro has two distinct rainy seasons, one from March to May and another around November. The northern slopes receive much less rainfall than the southern ones.<ref name="PlantEcology"/> The lower southern slope receives annually, rising to at altitude and peaking "partly over" in the forest belt at . In the alpine zone, annual precipitation decreases to .<ref name="PlantEcology2"/>
The average temperature in the summit area is approximately . Nighttime surface temperatures on the Northern Ice Field (NIF) fall on average to with an average daytime high of . During nights of extreme radiative cooling, the NIF can cool to as low as .<ref name="SinghSingh2011"></ref>
Snowfall can occur at any time of year but is mostly associated with northern Tanzania's two rainy seasons.<ref name="SinghSingh2011"/> Precipitation in the summit area occurs principally as snow and graupel of per year and ablates within days or years.<ref name="TraceElements"/>

== Tourism industry==
Kilimanjaro National Park generated US$51 million in revenue in 2013,<ref name="MusaHigham2015"></ref> the second-most of any Tanzanian national park.<ref name="Christie"></ref> The Tanzania National Parks Authority reported that the park recorded 57,456 tourists during the 2011–12 budget year, of whom 16,425 hiked the mountain; the park's General Management Plan specifies an annual capacity of 28,470.<ref></ref> The mountain hikers generated irregular and seasonal jobs for about 11,000 guides, porters, and cooks in 2007.<ref name="Mitchell"></ref> Concerns have been raised about their poor working conditions and inadequate wages of these workers.<ref name="MusaHigham2015"/><ref name="Christie"/><ref name="Mitchell"/> 
Due to its popularity as destination, the Tanzanian and Kenyan governments have invested in road infrastructure to improve accessibility to Kilimanjaro National Park. In Tanzania, Kilimanjaro International Airport also serves as an important transportation hub.<ref name="Reno"></ref>
There are seven official trekking routes by which to ascend and descend Kilimanjaro: Lemosho, Lemosho Western-Breach, Machame, Marangu, Mweka, Rongai, Shira, and Umbwe.<ref></ref> The Machame route can be completed in six or seven days,<ref name="Machame"></ref> Lemosho in six to eight, and the Northern Circuit routes in seven or more days. The Lemosho Route can also be continued via the Western-Breach, summitting via the western side of the mountain. The Western-Breach is more secluded and avoids the 6-hour midnight ascent to the summit (like other routes). The Rongai is the easiest of the camping routes.<ref></ref> The Marangu is also relatively easy, if frequently busy; accommodation is in shared huts.<ref></ref> The Lemosho Western-Breach Route commences on the western side of Kilimanjaro at Lemosho and continues to the summit via the Western-Breach Route.<ref name="Information about Mt Kilimanjaro"></ref><ref></ref>
=== Climbing records ===
The oldest person to climb Mount Kilimanjaro is Anne Lorimor, who reached Uhuru Peak 3.14 p.m. local time on 18 July 2019 aged 89 years and 37 days.<ref></ref> The oldest man to summit the mountain is the American Robert Wheeler, who was 85 years and 201 days when he summited on 2 October 2014.<ref name="records" /> Maxwell J.

Barker of Missouri, USA, later completed the same route at the age of ten years old on December 22, 2020. Theodore Margaroli from London age 10 reached the summit unassisted by the Western Breach, the hardest but most scenic route in 2019.<ref name="records" /><ref><nowiki>{{records|title= Youngest person to climb Mount Kilimanjaro via the Western Breach route|url=</nowiki> urltoken Despite an age-limit of 10 years for a climbing permit, Keats Boyd from Los Angeles reached the summit on 21 January 2008 at the age of 7.<ref name="records" /> This record was equaled by Montannah Kenney from Texas in March 2018.<ref name="records" /><ref></ref>
The fastest ascent and the fastest roundtrip have been recorded by the Swiss-Ecuadorian mountain guide Karl Egloff. On 13 August 2014, after guiding a party to the summit the previous days, he ran from Umbwe Gate to the top in 4 hours and 56 minutes and returned to the Mweka Gate at in a total time of 6 hours, 42 minutes and 24 seconds.<ref name="fkt"> urltoken Route: Kilimanjaro at fastestknowntime.com</ref><ref>Matt Hart, urltoken Where in the World Did Karl Egloff Come From? , Outside 5, Mar 2015</ref> Previous records, using the same route, were held by Spanish mountain runner Kílian Jornet (ascent in 5:23:50, roundtrip 7:14 on 29 September 2010) and by Tanzanian guide Simon Mtuy (an unsupported roundtrip in 9:21 on 22 February 2006).<ref> urltoken Swiss Sets New Kilimanjaro Fastest Ascent And Descent Record at climbkilimanjaroguide.com</ref><ref name="records"></ref><ref></ref>

=== Safety ===
Though the climb is not technically as challenging as the Himalayas or Andes, the high elevation, low temperature, and occasional high winds can make Kilimanjaro a difficult trek. Acclimatization is required, and even experienced and physically fit trekkers may suffer some degree of altitude sickness.<ref name=Acclimatization></ref><ref></ref> A study of people attempting to reach the summit of Kilimanjaro in July and August 2005 found that 61.3 percent succeeded and 77 percent experienced acute mountain sickness (AMS).<ref name="DaviesKalson2009"></ref> A retrospective study of 917 persons who attempted to reach the summit via the Lemosho or Machame routes found that 70.4 percent experienced AMS, defined in this study to be headache, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, or loss of appetite.<ref></ref>
Kilimanjaro's summit is well above the altitude at which life-threatening high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) or high altitude cerebral edema (HACE), the most severe forms of AMS, can occur.<ref name=MedicalProblems></ref> These health risks are increased substantially by excessively fast climbing schedules motivated by high daily national park fees, busy holiday travel schedules, and the lack of permanent shelter on most routes.<ref></ref> The six-day Machame route, which involves one night of "sleeping low", may delay the onset of AMS but does not ultimately prevent its occurrence.<ref></ref>
Falls on steep portions of the mountain and rock slides have killed trekkers. For this reason, the route via the Arrow Glacier was closed for several years, reopening in December 2007.<ref></ref> The improper disposal of human waste on the mountain environment has created a health hazard, necessitating the boiling of all water.<ref></ref>
According to the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre in Moshi, 25 people died from January 1996 to October 2003 while climbing the mountain. Seventeen were female and eight were male, ranging in age from 29 to 74. Fourteen died from advanced high altitude illness, including one with HACE, five with HAPE, and six with both HACE and HAPE. The remaining eleven deaths resulted from "trauma (3), myocardial infarction (4), pneumonia (2), cardio-pulmonary failure of other underlying cause (1), and acute appendicitis (1). The overall mortality rate was an 13.6 per 100,000 climbers."<ref></ref>

Approaching from the saddle between Mawenzi and Kibo, Höhnel stopped at , but Teleki continued until he reached the snow at .<ref></ref> Later in 1887, the German geology professor Hans Meyer reached the lower edge of the ice cap on Kibo, where he was forced to turn back because he lacked the equipment needed to progress across the ice.<ref name="Stewart"></ref> The following year, Meyer planned another attempt with Oscar Baumann, a cartographer, but the mission was aborted after the pair were held hostage and ransomed during the Abushiri Revolt.<ref name="Stewart"/> In the autumn of 1888, the American naturalist Dr. Abbott and the German explorer Otto Ehrenfried Ehlers approached the summit from the northwest. While Abbott turned back earlier, Ehlers at first claimed to have reached the summit rim, but after severe criticism of the claim, withdrew it.<ref name=meyer/>
In 1889, Meyer returned to Kilimanjaro with the Austrian mountaineer Ludwig Purtscheller for a third attempt.<ref name="Stewart"/> This attempt was based on the establishment of several campsites with food supplies so that multiple attempts at the top could be made without having to descend too far.<ref name="Stewart"/> Meyer and Purtscheller pushed to near the crater rim on 3 October but turned back exhausted from hacking footsteps in the icy slope.<ref name="Stewart"/> Three days later, they reached the highest summit, on the southern rim of the crater.<ref name="Stewart"/> They were the first to confirm that Kibo has a crater.<ref name="Stewart"/> After descending to the saddle between Kibo and Mawenzi, Meyer and Purtscheller attempted to climb the more technically challenging Mawenzi but could only reach the top of Klute Peak, a subsidiary peak, before retreating due to illness.<ref name="Stewart"/> On 18 October, they reascended Kibo to enter and study the crater, cresting the rim at Hans Meyers Notch.<ref name="Stewart"/> In total, Meyer and Purtscheller spent 16 days above during their expedition.<ref name="Stewart"/> They were accompanied in their high camps by Mwini Amani of Pangani, who cooked and supplied the sites with water and firewood.<ref name=meyer/>
The first ascent of the highest summit of Mawenzi was made on 29 July 1912, by the German climbers Eduard Hans Oehler and Fritz Klute, who named it Hans Meyer Peak.
