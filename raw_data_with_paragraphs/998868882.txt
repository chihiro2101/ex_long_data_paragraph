Monmouth Rebellion

==Duke of Monmouth==
Monmouth was an illegitimate son of Charles II. There had been rumours that Charles had married Monmouth's mother, Lucy Walter,<ref name="fraser">Fraser, 1979 page 175</ref> but no evidence was forthcoming,<ref>Bevan1973 pages 11–25</ref> and Charles always said that he only had one wife, Catherine of Braganza.<ref>Tincey, 2005 page 12</ref>
Monmouth had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the English Army by his father in 1672 and Captain general in 1678, enjoying some successes in the Netherlands in the Third Anglo-Dutch War, as commander of a British brigade in the French army.<ref name="fraser"/>
==Context==
The English Civil War had left resentment among some of the population about the monarchy and the penalties which had been imposed on the supporters of the Commonwealth. The South West of England contained several towns where opposition remained strong.<ref>Dunning, 1984 page 22</ref> Fears of a potential Catholic monarch persisted, intensified by the failure of Charles II and his wife to produce any children.<ref>Bevan, 1973 page 98</ref> A defrocked Anglican clergyman, Titus Oates, spoke of a "Popish Plot" to kill Charles and to put the Duke of York on the throne.<ref>Miller, 2000 page 87</ref> The Earl of Shaftesbury, a former government minister and a leading opponent of Catholicism, attempted to have James excluded from the line of succession.<ref>Miller, 2000 pages 99–105</ref> Some members of Parliament even proposed that the crown go to Charles's illegitimate son, James Scott, who became the Duke of Monmouth.<ref>Harris, 2006 page 74</ref> In 1679, with the Exclusion Bill - which would exclude the King's brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, from the line of succession - in danger of passing, Charles II dissolved Parliament.<ref>Miller, 2000 pages 93–95</ref> Two further Parliaments were elected in 1680 and 1681, but were dissolved for the same reason.<ref>Miller, 2000 page 103</ref>
After the Rye House Plot of 1683, an attempt to assassinate both Charles and James, Monmouth went into self-imposed exile in the Netherlands, and gathered supporters in The Hague.<ref></ref> Monmouth was a Protestant and had toured the South West of England in 1680, where he had been greeted amicably by crowds in towns such as Chard and Taunton.<ref>Clarke, 1985 pages 6–7</ref> So long as Charles II remained on the throne, Monmouth was content to live a life of pleasure in Holland, while still hoping to accede peaceably to the throne. The accession of James II and coronation at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1685 put an end to these hopes.<ref>Harris, 2006 page 45</ref>
==Plan==
The Monmouth rebellion was planned in Holland and coordinated with another rebellion in Scotland led by Archibald Campbell, the Duke of Argyll.<ref>Miller, 2000 pages 140–143</ref><ref>Harris, 2006 pages 73–86</ref> Several areas of England were considered as potential locations for rebellion, including Cheshire and Lancashire along with the South West, as these were seen as having the highest number of opponents of the monarchy.<ref>Earle 1977 page 55</ref> Argyll and Monmouth both began their expeditions from Holland, where James's nephew and son-in-law, stadtholder William III of Orange, had not detained them or put a stop to their recruitment efforts.<ref>Miller, 2000 pages 139–140</ref> Argyll sailed to Scotland and, on arriving there, raised recruits mainly from his own clan, the Campbells,<ref>Harris, 2006 pages 75–76</ref> as part of the Argyll's Rising. He had previously been involved in the Rye House Plot of 1683.<ref></ref><ref name=DNB></ref>
Another important member of the rebellion was Robert Ferguson, a fanatical Scottish Presbyterian minister. He was also known as "the plotter". It was Ferguson who drew up Monmouth's proclamation, and he who was most in favour of Monmouth being crowned King.<ref>Ferguson, 2008 page 215</ref> Thomas Hayward Dare was a goldsmith from Taunton and a Whig politician, a man of considerable wealth and influence who had been jailed during a political campaign calling for a new parliament. He was also fined the huge sum of £5,000 for uttering "seditious" words. After his release from jail, he fled to Holland and became the paymaster general to the Rebellion.<ref></ref>
To raise the funds for ships and weaponry, Monmouth pawned many of his belongings. His wife Anne Scott, 1st Duchess of Buccleuch, and her mother also pawned their jewellery to hire the Dutch warship Helderenberg.<ref>Bevan, 1973 page 192</ref> Ann Smith gave him £1,000.<ref name=ODNB></ref>
==From Lyme Regis to Sedgemoor==
On 30 May 1685<ref></ref> Monmouth set sail for South West England, a strongly Protestant region, with three small ships, four light field guns, and 1500 muskets.<ref></ref> He landed on 11 June with 82 supporters, including Lord Grey of Warke,<ref></ref> Nathaniel Wade, and Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun.<ref>Wyndham, 1976 page 131</ref> They gathered about 300 men on the first day at Lyme Regis in Dorset,<ref></ref> where a long statement prepared by Ferguson denounced the king.<ref>Harris, 2006 pages 82–85</ref><ref>Wyndham, 1976 pages 132–133</ref>
King James had previously received intelligence about the impending plot, and the ships leaving Holland, ten days before.<ref>Clarke, 1985 page 10</ref> He was warned of Monmouth's arrival soon after the first landing. The mayor of the town, Gregory Alford,<ref>Earle, 1977 page 57</ref> informed the local militias while Samuel Damsell and another customs officer rode from Lyme to London, arriving on 13 June, having ridden .<ref>Clarke, 1985 pages 10–13</ref> To face Monmouth's rebels, John Churchill was given command of the regular foot in the King's army, and the honour of leading the campaign passed to the Earl of Feversham.<ref>Tincey, 2005 pages 157–158</ref> It would take a few days to assemble the army and travel from London to the west country, therefore initial defence was left to local militias.
Over the next couple of days volunteers arrived in Lyme offering to serve under Monmouth. By 15 June he had a force in excess of 1,000 men.<ref>Dunning, 1984 page 24</ref> On 13 June he lost two of his leading supporters when Dare and Fletcher disputed who should ride one of the best horses provided by local supporters. Fletcher shot and killed Dare and was then put under arrest and sent back to the frigate Helderenberg.<ref>Tincey, 2005 page 41</ref> The next day, 40 cavalry and 400&nbsp;foot soldiers, under the command of Lord Grey and Wade, moved on to the nearby town of Bridport, where they encountered 1,200 men from the local royalist Dorset militia.<ref>Clarke, 1985 page 16</ref> The skirmish ended with the retreat of Grey and the cavalry followed by Wade with the foot soldiers.<ref>Tincey, 2005 pages 42–46</ref> Many of the militiamen deserted and joined Monmouth's army.<ref>Whiles, 1985 page 7</ref> Following this confrontation, Lord Albermarle led a royalist force from Exeter towards the forces of the Duke of Somerset, who were approaching Lyme Regis from the opposite direction.<ref>Clarke, 1985 page 18</ref>
Monmouth learned of the approach of royalist reinforcements and departed, but instead of marching to London, he headed north with his force towards the county of Somerset. On 15 June he fought with the militia at Axminster, taking the town before the militias could join up.<ref>Tincey, 2005 pages 47–49</ref> More recruits joined his disorganised force, which was now around 6,000, consisting mostly of nonconformists, artisans, and farm workers armed with farm tools (such as pitchforks).<ref name="histuk"></ref> One famous supporter was the young Daniel Defoe.<ref>Earle, 1977 page 180</ref>
Monmouth again denounced the king in Chard<ref></ref> and was the subject of a coronation in Taunton on 20 June 1685, against the wishes of some of his republican supporters such as Wade.<ref name=dunning26>Dunning, 1984 page 26</ref> The Taunton Corporation was forced to witness the event at sword point outside the White Hart Inn, to encourage the support of the country gentry.<ref></ref> In Taunton, Monmouth was joined by many new supporters and formed a new regiment of 800 men.<ref name=dunning26/> The king's force of Dragoons under Churchill continued to close on Monmouth, arriving in Chard on 19 June. With the assistance of the local militias they attempted to stop new recruits arriving in Taunton to join Monmouth.<ref>Tincey, 2005 pages 52–54</ref> Feversham meanwhile moved with his forces into Bristol, on the assumption that this would be Monmouth's next target, and took overall charge of the campaign.<ref>Tincey, 2005 pages 54–56</ref>
Monmouth and his growing force then continued north to Bridgwater, where he took up residence at Bridgwater Castle on 21 June,<ref></ref> Glastonbury (22 June) and on to Shepton Mallet, arriving on 23 June in worsening weather.<ref>Wyndham (1976), pages 135–137</ref> Meanwhile, the Royal Navy captured Monmouth's ships, cutting off any hope of an escape back to the continent.<ref></ref> The Royalist forces of Churchill, who was now in Chard, and of Feversham, in Bristol, also received reinforcements who had marched from London.<ref>Tincey, 2005 pages 58–61</ref>
On 24 June, Monmouth's army encamped at Pensford, and a small force skirmished with the Gloucester Militia to take control of Keynsham, a vital crossing point over the River Avon. He made Keynsham Abbey his headquarters there.<ref>Tincey, 2005 page 61</ref> Monmouth intended to attack the city of Bristol, after London the largest and most important city in England at that time, However, he heard the city had been occupied by Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort. There were inconclusive skirmishes with a force of Life Guards commanded by Feversham.<ref>Tincey, 2005 pages 61–67</ref> These attacks gave the impression that there was a much larger royalist force in the vicinity than there actually was. Several historians have speculated that if Monmouth had marched as quickly as possible for Bristol at this point, when it was only protected by the Gloucestershire militia, he would probably have been able to take the city and the final outcome of the rebellion might have been very different. Once Bristol had been taken, more recruits would have been attracted to the Rebellion and a later march on London would have been possible.<ref>Tincey, 2005 pages 64–67</ref><ref>Dunning, 1984 page 28</ref><ref>Wyndham, 1976 pages 139–141</ref><ref>Clarke, 1985 page 24</ref><ref>Earle, 1977 pages 97–98</ref><ref>Sawers, 2007 pages 12–13</ref>
On 26 June, Monmouth moved towards Bath, and arriving on the south side of it found it had also been occupied by royalist troops. He camped for the night in Philips Norton (now Norton St Philip), where his forces were attacked on the morning of 27 June by the leading elements of Feversham's forces, which had now combined into a larger force, but were still awaiting their artillery.<ref name="Tincey 2005 pages 68 73">Tincey, 2005 pages 68–73</ref> Monmouth’s half-brother Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, led some cavalry, dragoons, and 500 musketeers into the village, where they were surrounded by the rebels and had to hack through hedges to escape. They were rescued by Churchill and withdrew with approximately twenty casualties on each side; however, each side believed that the other had taken greater losses.<ref name="Tincey 2005 pages 68 73"/>
Monmouth then marched overnight to Frome, arriving on 28 June. The morale of Monmouth's forces started to collapse as news of the failure of the rebellion in Scotland arrived that day, while the makeshift army was camped in Frome.<ref></ref><ref>Tincey, 2005 page 74</ref> Argyll's small force had been involved in minor skirmishes at Greenock and Ellangreig. He took Ardkinglass castle, but after disagreements with key supporters about when and where to fight the royalists commanded by Rosse and William Cleland, his supporters dwindled away and the Scottish rebellion failed.<ref name="DNB"/>
The rebels planned to go next to Warminster, where there were many nonconformist wool workers, but on 27 June the Wiltshire Militia had marched from Bath to Trowbridge, and on 29 June entered Westbury. Hearing that an army supporting him had gathered near Bridgwater, Monmouth turned back through Shepton Mallet and arrived in Wells on 1 July. <ref>Whiles, 1985 page 10</ref> His men damaged the Bishop's Palace and the west front of Wells Cathedral, tearing lead from the roof to make bullets, breaking the windows, smashing the organ and the furnishings, and for a time stabling their horses in the nave.<ref></ref>
Feversham aimed to contain the rebels in the South West until the rest of his forces, including three battalions of British mercenaries sent by William III of Orange from Holland arrived. In the light of propaganda suggesting the rebels had an army of 40,000 and that 500 royalist troops had been lost at Norton St Philip, Feversham was ordered to engage Monmouth's forces. On 30 June the final parts of Feversham's army, including his artillery, arrived and eventually Monmouth was pushed back via Shepton Mallet to the Somerset Levels, where Alfred the Great had found refuge in his conflicts with the Vikings. Becoming hemmed in at Bridgwater on 3 July, he ordered his troops to fortify the town.<ref></ref>
==Battle of Sedgemoor==
Monmouth was finally defeated by Feversham with John Churchill, his second in command, on 6 July at the Battle of Sedgemoor.
Once Monmouth's force had entered and started to fortify Bridgwater, he sent some of his cavalry to collect six cannon from Minehead. He planned to stay in Bridgwater until they returned and then break out and head for Bristol. Feversham and his army of 500 horse and 1,500 militiamen camped on the edge of Sedgemoor at the village of Westonzoyland. Monmouth could view them from the tower of Church of St Mary and may have inspected them more closely from the Church of St Mary in Chedzoy, before deciding to attack them.<ref>Tincey, 2005 pages 84–89</ref>
The Duke eventually led his untrained and ill-equipped troops out of Bridgwater at around 10:00&nbsp;pm to undertake a night-time attack on the King's army. They were guided by Richard Godfrey, the servant of a local farmer, along the old Bristol road towards Bawdrip. With their limited cavalry in the vanguard, they turned south along Bradney Lane and Marsh Lane and came to the open moor with its deep and dangerous rhynes (drainage ditches).<ref></ref>
There was a delay while the rhyne was crossed and the first men across startled a royalist patrol. A shot was fired and a horseman from the patrol galloped off to report to Feversham. Lord Grey of Warke led the rebel cavalry forward and they were engaged by the King's Regiment of Horse which alerted the rest of the royalist forces.<ref>Whiles, 1985 page 24</ref> The superior training of the regular army and their horses routed the rebel forces by outflanking them. His untrained supporters were quickly defeated by the professionals, and hundreds were cut down by cannon- and musket-fire.
The death count on the rebel side has variously been given as between 727 and 2,700, with royalist losses of 27 who were buried in the churchyard of the Church of St Mary the Virgin in Westonzoyland, which was used as a prison for rebel soldiers.<ref></ref>
==After Sedgemoor==
Monmouth fled from the field of battle, but was captured in a ditch on 8 July (either at Ringwood in the New Forest, or at Horton in Dorset<ref></ref>). Parliament had passed an Act of Attainder, on 13 June sentencing Monmouth to death as a traitor,<ref></ref> therefore no trial was needed before his execution. Despite begging for mercy and claims of conversion to Catholic Church, he was beheaded at Tower Hill by Jack Ketch on 15 July 1685. It is said that it took multiple blows of the axe to sever his head. Though some sources say it took eight blows, the official Tower of London website says it took five blows,<ref></ref> while Charles Spencer, in his book Blenheim, claims it was seven.<ref>Spencer, 2004 page 54</ref> The Hangman in 'Punch and Judy' is named after this notorious character, Jack Ketch. The dukedoms of Monmouth and Buccleuch were forfeited, but the subsidiary titles of the dukedom of Monmouth were restored to the Duke of Buccleuch.<ref>Bevan, 1973 page 237</ref>
The subsequent Bloody Assizes of Judge Jeffreys were a series of trials of Monmouth's supporters in which 320 people were condemned to death and around 800 sentenced to be transported to the Caribbean, <ref></ref> for ten years' hard labour.<ref></ref>
James II took advantage of the suppression of the rebellion to consolidate his power. He asked Parliament to repeal the Test Act and the Habeas Corpus Act, used his dispensing power to appoint Roman Catholics to senior posts, and raised the strength of the standing army. Parliament opposed many of these moves, and on 20 November 1685 James dismissed it. In 1688, when the birth of James Francis Edward Stuart heralded a Catholic succession, James II was deposed by William of Orange in the Glorious Revolution at the invitation of the disaffected Protestant Establishment.<ref></ref>

The Monmouth Rebellion and the events surrounding it have formed the basis for several works of fiction. John Dryden's work Absalom and Achitophel is a satire partially concerned with equating biblical events with the Monmouth Rebellion.<ref></ref> The Monmouth Rebellion plays a key role in Peter S. Beagle's novel Tamsin, about a 300-year-old ghost who is befriended by the protagonist.<ref></ref> It also plays an important role in R. D. Blackmore's novel Lorna Doone. Arthur Conan Doyle's historical novel Micah Clarke deals directly with Monmouth's landing in England, the raising of his army, its defeat at Sedgemoor, and the reprisals which followed.<ref></ref> Several characters in Neal Stephenson's trilogy The Baroque Cycle, particularly Quicksilver and The Confusion, play a role in the Monmouth Rebellion and its aftermath.<ref></ref>
Dr. Peter Blood, main hero of Rafael Sabatini's novel Captain Blood, was sentenced by Judge Jeffreys for aiding wounded Monmouth rebels. Transported to the Caribbean, he started his career as a pirate there.<ref></ref> Another of Sabatini's novels, Mistress Wilding, also takes place during this time, as the hero, Anthony Wilding, is a supporter of Monmouth. John Masefield's 1910 novel Martin Hyde: The Duke's Messenger tells the story of a boy who plays a central part in the Monmouth Rebellion, from the meeting with Argyll in Holland to the failed rebellion itself.<ref></ref> The Royal Changeling, (1998), by John Whitbourn, describes the rebellion with some fantasy elements added, from the viewpoint of Sir Theophilus Oglethorpe.<ref></ref>
In Lorna Doone, Richard Doddridge Blackmore's romantic novel of 1869, Farmer John Ridd rescues his brother-in-law Tom Faggus from the battlefield of Sedgwick, but is captured as a rebel, and is brought before Judge Jefferies. Another novel covering the events of the Rebellion was Sir Walter Besant's For Faith and Freedom.
The events immediately before and after the Battle of Sedgemoor, and leading up to James II's exile following The Glorious Revolution provide the setting for Robert Neill's historical novel Lilliburlero.<ref></ref> The aftermath of the Rebellion is the setting for A.E.W. Mason's 1896 novel The Courtship of Morrice Buckler.

The Monmouth Rebellion, also known as the Pitchfork Rebellion, the Revolt of the West or the West Country rebellion, was an attempt to overthrow James II. Prince James, Duke of York, had become King of England, Scotland, and Ireland upon the death of his elder brother Charles II on 6 February 1685. James II was a Roman Catholic and some Protestants under his rule opposed his kingship. James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, the eldest illegitimate son of Charles II, claimed to be rightful heir to the throne and attempted to displace his uncle.
Plans were discussed to overthrow the monarch, following the failure of the Rye House Plot to assassinate Charles II and James in 1683, while Monmouth was in self-imposed exile in the Dutch Republic. The Monmouth rebellion was coordinated with Argyll's Rising, a rebellion in Scotland, where Archibald Campbell, the Duke of Argyll, landed with a small force. The Duke of Monmouth had been popular in the South West of England, so he planned to recruit troops locally and take control of the area before marching on London.
Monmouth landed at Lyme Regis on 11 June 1685. In the following few weeks, his growing army of nonconformists, artisans and farm workers fought a series of skirmishes with local militias and regular soldiers commanded by Louis de Duras, 2nd Earl of Feversham and John Churchill, who later became the Duke of Marlborough. Monmouth's forces were unable to compete with the regular army and failed to capture the city of Bristol. The rebellion ended with the defeat of Monmouth's army at the Battle of Sedgemoor on 6 July 1685 by forces led by Feversham and Churchill.
Monmouth was executed for treason on 15 July 1685. Many of his supporters were tried during the Bloody Assizes, led by Judge Jeffreys and were condemned to death or transportation. James II was able to consolidate his power and reigned until 1688, when he was deposed by William of Orange in the Glorious Revolution.
