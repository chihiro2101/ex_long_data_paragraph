James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth

==Biography==
===Parentage and early life===
During the summer of 1648, Charles II of England was captivated by Lucy Walter, who was at The Hague for a short while about this time. He was only eighteen, and she is often spoken of as his first mistress, but they may have had a tryst as early as 1646.<ref> cites Gardiner, Hist. of Civil War, iii. 238; Boero, Istoria.di Carlo II, Rome, 1863.</ref>
Charles moved to The Hague during 1648, during the Second English Civil War, where his sister Mary and his brother-in-law William II, Prince of Orange, were providing more support to his father Charles I‘s cause than his French relations.
James was born in Rotterdam in the Netherlands on 9 April 1649, and spent his early years in Schiedam.<ref name=odnb></ref>
Research by Hugh Noel Williams suggests that Charles had not arrived at The Hague until the middle of September 1648 – seven months before the child's birth, but that he had met Lucy in July. Some voices later whispered that in the summer of 1648 Lucy had been the mistress of Colonel Robert Sidney, a younger son of the Earl of Leicester.<ref>Williams, p. 6</ref> When the child grew to manhood, those loyal to the Duke of York (whom the exclusionists wished to replace as heir to the throne) publicly put about the story that they saw a semblance to Sidney.<ref name=odnb/> These voices may have been encouraged by the Duke of York himself, brother of King Charles II, who was afraid of any of the acknowledged fourteen royal bastards’ possible claims to the throne, Charles having no legitimate surviving children.<ref name=odnb/> In 2012, a DNA test of Monmouth's patrilineal descendant the 10th Duke of Buccleuch showed that he shared the same Y chromosome as a distant Stuart cousin; this is evidence that Charles II was indeed Monmouth's father.<ref name=scotsman></ref>
Monmouth had a younger sister or half-sister, Mary Crofts, whose father may have been Lord Taaffe. Mary later married the Irishman William Sarsfield, thus becoming the sister-in-law of the Jacobite general Patrick Sarsfield.<ref></ref>
As an illegitimate son, Monmouth was ineligible to succeed to the English or Scottish thrones, unless he could prove rumours that his parents had married secretly.<ref></ref> Monmouth came to maintain that his parents were married and that he possessed evidence of their marriage, but he never produced it.<ref name="hull"></ref> Charles II, as King, later testified in writing to his Council that he had never been married to anyone except his queen, Catherine of Braganza.<ref></ref>
In March 1658, young James Crofts was kidnapped by one of the King's men, sent to Paris, and placed in the care of a John Crofts (1635–1664), whose surname he took. He briefly attended a school in Familly.<ref name=odnb/>
===Officer and commander===
On 14 February 1663, at the age of 13, shortly after having been brought to England, James was created Duke of Monmouth, with the subsidiary titles of Earl of Doncaster and Baron Scott of Tynedale, all three in the Peerage of England, and on 28 March 1663 he was appointed a Order of the Garter.<ref></ref>
On 20 April 1663, just days after his 14th birthday, he was married to the heiress Anne Scott, 1st Duchess of Buccleuch. James took his wife's surname upon marriage.<ref name="hull"/> The day after his marriage, the couple were made Duke of Buccleuch, Earl and Countess of Dalkeith, and Lord and Lady Scott of Whitchester and Eskdale in the Peerage of Scotland.<ref name="burkes"></ref> Monmouth, as he became known, was popular, particularly for his Protestantism, whereas the official heir presumptive to the throne, the King's brother James, Duke of York, had openly converted to Catholic Church.<ref name=odnb/>
In 1665, at the age of 16, Monmouth served in the Royal Navy under his uncle, the Duke of York in the Second Anglo-Dutch War.<ref name=odnb/> In June 1666, he returned to England to become captain of a troop of cavalry.<ref name=odnb/> On 16 September 1668 he was made colonel of the 1st Troop of Horse Guards.<ref name=odnb/> He acquired Moor Park in Hertfordshire in April 1670.<ref></ref> At the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Dutch War in 1672, a brigade of 6,000 English and Scottish troops was sent to serve as part of the French army (in return for money paid to King Charles), with Monmouth as its commander.<ref name=odnb/> He became Lord Lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire and Governor of Kingston-upon-Hull in April 1673.<ref name=odnb/> In the campaign of 1673 and in particular at the Siege of Maastricht that June, Monmouth gained a considerable reputation as one of Britain's finest soldiers.<ref name=odnb/> He was reported to be replacing Marshal Schomberg as commander of England's Zealand Expedition, but this did not happen.<ref>Watson p.67-68</ref>
In 1674, Monmouth became Chancellor of Cambridge University<ref></ref> and Master of the Horse, and King Charles II directed that all military orders should be brought first to Monmouth for examination, thus giving him effective command of the forces; his responsibilities included the movement of troops and the suppression of riots.<ref name=odnb/> In March 1677, he also became Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire.<ref name=odnb/>
===Claim to the Crown===
In 1678, Monmouth was the commander of the Anglo-Dutch brigade, now fighting for the Dutch Republic against the French, and he distinguished himself at the Battle of Saint-Denis in August that year during the Franco-Dutch War, further increasing his reputation.<ref></ref> The following year, after his return to Britain, he commanded the small army raised to put down the rebellion of the Scottish Covenanters and despite being heavily outnumbered, he decisively defeated the (admittedly poorly equipped) Covenanter rebels at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge on 22 June 1679.<ref name=odnb/>
===Rebellion===
As his popularity with the masses increased, Monmouth was obliged to go into exile in the Dutch Dutch Republic in September 1679.<ref name=odnb/> Following the discovery of the so-called Rye House Plot in 1683, which aimed to assassinate both Charles II and his brother James, Monmouth, who had been encouraged by his supporters to assert his right to the throne, was identified as a conspirator.<ref></ref> On King Charles II's death in February 1685, Monmouth led the Monmouth Rebellion, landing with three ships at Lyme Regis in Dorset in early June 1685, in an attempt to take the throne from his uncle, James II and VII.<ref></ref> He published a "Declaration for the defence and vindication of the protestant religion and of the laws, rights and privileges of England from the invasion made upon them, and for delivering the Kingdom from the usurpation and tyranny of us by the name of James, Duke of York": King James II and VII responded to this by issuing an order for the publishers and distributors of the paper to be arrested.<ref></ref>
Monmouth declared himself as the rightful King at various places along the route including Axminster, Chard,<ref></ref> Ilminster and Taunton.<ref name=odnb/> The two armies met at the Battle of Sedgemoor on 6 July 1685, the last clear-cut pitched battle on open ground between two military forces fought on English soil: Monmouth's makeshift force could not compete with the regular army, and was soundly defeated.<ref></ref>
===Capture===
Following the battle a reward of £5,000 was offered for his capture.<ref name="roberts">Roberts, p. 109</ref> On 8 July 1685, Monmouth was captured and arrested near Ringwood in Hampshire,<ref></ref> by tradition "in a field of peas". The events surrounding his capture are recorded in detail in Tait's Edinburgh Magazine.<ref>Tait's Edinburgh Magazine, Volume 12, January 1845, p.57,ed. William Tait, Christian Isobel Johnstone urltoken 
When the Duke had left his horse at Woodyates Inn, he exchanged clothes with a shepherd, who was soon discovered by local loyalists and interrogated. Dogs were then put onto the Duke's scent. Monmouth dropped his gold snuff-box, full of gold pieces, in a pea-field, where it was afterwards found.
From Woodyates Inn the Duke had gone to Shag's Heath, in the middle of which was a cluster of small farms, called the "Island". Amy Farrant gave information that the fugitives were concealed within the Island. The Duke, accompanied by Busse and Brandenburgher, remained concealed all day, with soldiers surrounding the area and threatening to set fire to the woodland. Brandenburgher deserted him at 1 am, and was later captured and interrogated, and is believed to have given away the Duke's hiding place. The spot was at the north-eastern extremity of the Island, now known as Monmouth's Close, in the manor of Woodlands, the property of the Earl of Shaftesbury. At about 7 am Henry Parkin, a militia-soldier and servant of Samuel Rolle, discovered the brown skirt of Monmouth's coat as he lay hidden in a ditch covered with fern and brambles under an ash tree, and called for help. The Duke was seized. Bystanders shouted out "Shoot him! shoot him!", but Sir William Portman happening to be near the spot, immediately rode up, and laid hands on him as his prisoner. Monmouth was then "in the last extremity of hunger and fatigue, with no sustenance but a few raw peas in his pocket. He could not stand, and his appearance was much changed. Since landing in England, the Duke had not had a good night's rest, or eaten one meal in quiet, being perpetually agitated with the cares that attend unfortunate ambition". He had "received no other sustenance than the brook and the field afforded".<ref>Tait's Edinburgh Magazine</ref>
The Duke was taken to Holt Lodge, in the parish of Wimborne, about a mile away, the residence of Anthony Etterick, a magistrate who asked the Duke what he would do if released, to which he answered "that if his horse and arms were but restored to him at the same time, he needed only to ride through the army; and he defied them to take him again". The magistrate ordered him taken to London.<ref name=roberts/>
===Attainder and execution===
Following Monmouth's capture, Parliament passed an Act of Attainder, 1 Ja. II c. 2:<ref>Raithby, p.2</ref>
The King took the unusual step of allowing his nephew an audience, despite having no intention of extending a pardon to him, thus breaking with a longstanding tradition that the King would give an audience only when he intended to show clemency. The prisoner unsuccessfully implored his mercy, and even offered to convert to Catholicism, but to no avail. The King, disgusted by his abject behaviour, coldly told him to prepare to die, and later remarked that Monmouth "did not behave as well as I expected". Numerous pleas for mercy were addressed to the King, but he ignored them all, even that of his sister-in-law, the Catherine of Braganza.<ref>Beatty, p. 60</ref>
Monmouth was beheaded by Jack Ketch on 15 July 1685, on Tower Hill.<ref></ref> Shortly beforehand, Bishops Turner of Ely and Ken of Bath and Wells visited the Duke to prepare him for eternity, but withheld the Eucharist, for the condemned man refused to acknowledge that either his rebellion or his relationship with Lady Wentworth had been sinful.<ref>Macaulay, p.491</ref> It is said that before laying his head on the block, Monmouth specifically bade Ketch finish him at one blow, saying he had mauled others before. Disconcerted, Ketch did indeed inflict multiple blows with his axe, the prisoner rising up reproachfully the while – a ghastly sight that shocked the witnesses, drawing forth execrations and groans. Some say a knife was at last employed to sever the head from the twitching body. Sources vary; some claim eight blows, the official Tower of London fact sheet says it took five blows,<ref></ref> while Charles Spencer, in his book Blenheim, puts it at seven.<ref>Spencer, p.54: "Monmouth had a particularly grisly end, the executioner's axe striking seven times before his head severed"</ref> His execution was alluded to in the film Kind Hearts and Coronets, where the executioner says "The last execution of a duke in this country was very badly botched. But that was in the days of the axe."<ref></ref>
Monmouth was buried in the Church of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower of London.<ref></ref> His Dukedom was forfeited, but his subsidiary titles, Earl of Doncaster and Baron Scott of Tindale, were restored by King George II on 23 March 1743 to his grandson Francis Scott, 2nd Duke of Buccleuch (1695–1751).<ref></ref>
===Popular legends===
According to legend, a portrait was painted of Monmouth after his execution: the tradition states that it was realised after the execution that there was no official portrait of the Duke, so his body was exhumed, the head stitched back on, and it was sat for its portrait to be painted.<ref></ref> However, there are at least two formal portraits of Monmouth tentatively dated to before his death currently in the National Portrait Gallery in London,<ref></ref> and another painting once identified with Monmouth that shows a sleeping or dead man that could have given rise to the story.<ref></ref>
One of the many theories about the identity of Man in the Iron Mask is that he was Monmouth: this seems to be based on the unlikely reasoning that James II would not execute his own nephew, so someone else was executed, and James II arranged for Monmouth to be taken to France and put in the custody of his cousin Louis XIV of France.<ref>Shaw, Samuel, "Duke of Monmouth: Man in the Iron Mask" in Oxford Journals (Oxford, 1870) Vol s4-V, No 120.</ref>
Henry Purcell set to music (Z. 481) a satirical poem by an unidentified author, ridiculing Monmouth and his parentage:<ref></ref>
A grasshopper and a fly,<br />In summer hot and dry,<br />
In eager argument were met<br />
About priority.<br />
<br />
Says the fly to the grasshopper:<br />
"From mighty race I spring,<br />
Bright Phoebus was my dad 'tis known,<br />
And I eat and drink with a king."<br />
<br />
Says the grasshopper to the fly:<br />
"Such rogues are still preferr'd;<br />
Your father might be of high degree,<br />
But your mother was but a turd."<br />
<br />
So, rebel Jemmy Scott,<br />
That did to the empire soar,<br />
His father might be the Lord knows what,<br />
But his mother we knew a whore".

James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, 1st Duke of Buccleuch, KG, PC (9 April 1649 – 15 July 1685) was a Dutch-born English nobleman. Originally called James Crofts or James Fitzroy, he was born in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, the eldest illegitimate son of Charles II of England, Scotland, and Ireland with his mistress Lucy Walter.
He served in the Second Anglo-Dutch War and commanded English troops taking part in the Third Anglo-Dutch War before commanding the Anglo-Dutch brigade fighting in the Franco-Dutch War. He led the unsuccessful Monmouth Rebellion in 1685, an attempt to depose his uncle, King James II and VII. After one of his officers declared Monmouth the legitimate King in the town of Taunton in Somerset, Monmouth attempted to capitalise on his Protestantism and his position as the son of Charles II, in opposition to James, who was a Roman Catholic. The rebellion failed, and Monmouth was beheaded for treason on 15 July 1685.
