Mount Vernon

== Washington's tomb ==
On December 12, 1799, Washington spent several hours riding over the plantation, in snow, hail and freezing rain. He ate his supper later that evening without changing from his wet clothes. The following day, he awoke with a severe sore throat (either quinsy or acute epiglottitis) and became increasingly hoarse as the day progressed. All the available medical treatments failed to improve his condition, and he died at Mount Vernon at around 10 pm on December 14, 1799, aged 67.
On December 18, a funeral was held at Mount Vernon, where his body was interred.<ref name="Funeral"></ref> Congress passed a joint resolution to construct a marble monument in the United States Capitol for his body, an initiative supported by Martha. In December 1800, the United States House passed an appropriations bill for $200,000 to build the mausoleum, which was to be a pyramid with a base square. Southerners who wanted his body to remain at Mount Vernon defeated the measure.<ref name="boorstin"></ref>
In accordance with his will, Washington was entombed in a family crypt he had built upon first inheriting the estate. It was in disrepair by 1799, so Washington's will also requested that a new, larger tomb be built. This was not executed until 1831, the centennial of his birth. The need for a new tomb was confirmed when an unsuccessful attempt was made to steal his skull.<ref name="Johnston1889"></ref> A joint Congressional committee in early 1832 debated the removal of Washington's body from Mount Vernon to a crypt in the Capitol, built by Charles Bulfinch in the 1820s. Southern opposition was intense, exacerbated by an ever-growing rift between North and South. Congressman Wiley Thompson of Georgia expressed the Southerners' fears when he said:
In 1831, the bodies of George and Martha Washington, along with other members of the family, were moved from the old crypt to the new family tomb.<ref> urltoken On October 7, 1837, Washington's remains, encased in a lead inner casket, were transferred from the closed tomb to a sarcophagus presented by John Struthers of Philadelphia. It was placed on the right side of the gateway to the tomb. A similar structure was provided for Martha's remains, which was placed on the left.<ref name="Washington1847"></ref> Other members of the Washington family are interred in an inner vault, behind the vestibule containing the sarcophagi.
== Preservation, legacy and tourism ==
Following Martha Washington's death in 1802, George Washington's will was carried out in accordance with the terms of his bequests. The largest part of his estate, which included both his papers and Mount Vernon, passed to his nephew, Bushrod Washington, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.<ref>(1) <br />(2) <br />(3) . Original source: <br>(4) .<br />(5) .</ref> The younger Washington and his wife then moved to Mount Vernon.<ref></ref> 
Bushrod Washington did not inherit much cash and was unable to support the upkeep of the estate's mansion on the proceeds from the property and his Supreme Court salary. He sold some of his own slaves to gain working capital.<ref>(1) At Google Books.<br>(2) </ref> However, the farms' low revenues left him short, and he was unable to adequately maintain the mansion.
Following Bushrod Washington's death in 1829, ownership of the plantation passed to George Washington's grandnephew, John Augustine Washington II. After he died in 1832, his wife, Jane Charlotte inherited the estate, and her son began managing it. Upon her death in 1855, John Augustine Washington III inherited the property. As his funds dwindled and the wear and tear of hundreds of visitors began to take its toll, Washington could do little to maintain the mansion and its surroundings.<ref name="Rescue"></ref> 
Washington suggested to the United States Congress that the federal government purchase the mansion.<ref name="Rescue"/> However, Congress paid little interest to Washington's offer, as the legislature was focusing on the conditions that shortly led to the American Civil War.<ref name="Rescue"/> Washington then traveled to Richmond, where he was equally unsuccessful in appealing to the Virginia General Assembly for the state to purchase the mansion.<ref name="Rescue"/> The mansion's decline continued.<ref name="Rescue"/>
In 1858, Washington sold the mansion and a portion of the estate's land to the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, which was under the leadership of Ann Pamela Cunningham.<ref name="Rescue"/> The association paid the final installment of the purchase price of $200,000 ($6.3 million in 2020 dollars) in December 1859, taking possession in February 1860.<ref name="Rescue"/> The estate first opened to the public during that year.<ref name=aboutMV/> 
The estate served as a neutral ground for both sides during the Civil War, although fighting raged across the nearby countryside. Troops from both the Union and the Confederacy toured the building. The two women caretakers asked that the soldiers leave their arms behind and either change to civilian clothes or at least cover their uniforms. They usually did as asked.<ref></ref>
Harrison Howell Dodge became the third resident superintendent in 1885. During his 52 years' overseeing the estate, he doubled the facility's acreage, improved the grounds, and added many historic artifacts to the collections. Dodge reviewed George Washington's writings about the estate, visited other Colonial-era gardens, and traveled to England to see gardens dating from the Georgian period. Using that knowledge, Dodge oversaw the restoration of the site and put in place a number of improvements that Washington had planned but had never implemented.<ref name="obit"></ref> 
Charles Wall was assistant superintendent from 1929 to 1937, then resident superintendent for 39 years. He oversaw restoration of the house and planted greenery consistent with what was used in the 18th century. In 1974, a campaign he organized was successful in preserving as parkland areas in Maryland across the Potomac River from Mount Vernon, as part of an effort to retain the bucolic vista from the house.<ref name="WallObit"></ref> His office was the same one used in the 18th century by Washington.<ref name="Barnes1995"></ref>
Steamboats began to carry tourists to the Mount Vernon estate in 1878.<ref></ref> In 1892, the Washington, Alexandria and Mount Vernon Electric Railway opened, providing electric Tram service between Alexandria and the estate.<ref name="GWMP"></ref><ref name="Merriken"></ref><ref>1894 topographic map of the city of Alexandria, Alexandria County, and eastern Fairfax County, showing the route of the Washington, Alexandria and Mount Vernon Railway (unlabled) between the city of Alexandria and Mount Vernon: </ref> The electric railway and its successors carried tourists and others between Washington, D.C., and Mount Vernon from 1896 to 1932, when the federal government acquired part of its route on which to construct the George Washington Memorial Parkway.<ref name="Merriken" /><ref>(1) <br>(2) 1904 map of Alexandria County (now Arlington County), the city of Alexandria and southeastern Fairfax County showing the route of the Washington, Alexandria & Mt.

 on the site of Washington's original distillery, a short distance from his mansion on the Potomac River. Construction of the distillery cost $2.1&nbsp;million. The fully functional replica received special legislation from the Virginia General Assembly to produce up to of whiskey annually, for sale only at the Mount Vernon gift shop. 
Frank Coleman, spokesman for the Distilled Spirits Council that funded the reconstruction, said the distillery "will become the equivalent of a national distillery museum" and serve as a gateway to the American Whiskey Trail.<ref name="Barakat2007"></ref> In 2019, Mount Vernon began an annual whiskey festival.<ref></ref>
As of 2020, the estate had received more than 85&nbsp;million visitors.<ref name=aboutMV/> In addition to the mansion, visitors can see original and reconstructed outbuildings and barns (including slaves' quarters), an operational blacksmith shop, and the Pioneer Farm. Each year on Christmas Day, Aladdin the Christmas Camel recreates Washington's 1787 hiring of a camel for 18 shillings to entertain his guests with an example of the animal that brought the Three Wise Men to Bethlehem to visit the newborn Jesus.<ref name="MB"></ref>
Mount Vernon remains a privately owned property. The non-profit Mount Vernon Ladies' Association has not received any funds from the federal government to support the restoration and maintenance of the mansion and the estate's grounds or its educational programs and activities.<ref name="Smithsonian2006"></ref> 
The association derives its income from charitable donations and the sales of tickets, produce and goods to visitors. These enable the Association to continue its mission "to preserve, restore, and manage the estate of George Washington to the highest standards and to educate visitors and people throughout the world about the life and legacies of George Washington, so that his example of character and leadership will continue to inform and inspire future generations."<ref name="AboutMV"></ref> Admission to Mount Vernon is free on Presidents' Day (the third Monday of February) and on George Washington's birthday (February 22).<ref></ref> 
Mount Vernon was featured in a 1-cent United States postage stamp in 1936 within the Army and Navy Commemorative Series. The green stamp, which was the first in the series, also contained portraits of George Washington and Nathanael Greene, a Major General of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.<ref> .</ref> 
In 1956, a 1.5-cent stamp within the Liberty Issue of U.S. postage stamps memorialized Mount Vernon as a national shrine. The Liberty Issue was originally planned to honor six presidents, six famous Americans, and six historic national shrines. The Mount Vernon stamp, which featured a view of Washington's home facing the Potomac River, was the issue's first that commemorated a shrine.<ref> .</ref> 
Mount Vernon was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 19, 1960, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.<ref name=register/><ref name=landmark/> Development and improvement of the estate is an ongoing concern. Following a $110&nbsp;million fundraising campaign, two new buildings that GWWO, Inc./Architects had designed opened in 2006 as venues for additional background on George Washington and the American Revolution.
Mount Vernon was put on the tentative list for World Heritage Site status in the early 2000s. It was submitted but failed to get approved. In 2014, Mount Vernon awarded its first Cyrus A. Ansary Prize for Courage and Character to former President George H. W. Bush.<ref>Baker, Peter, urltoken "Bush 41 Reunion Looks to Burnish His Legacy" , New York Times, 3 April 2014.

The tobacco market had declined, and many planters in northern Virginia converted to mixed crops. Like them, by 1766 Washington had ceased growing tobacco at Mount Vernon and had replaced the crop with wheat, corn, and other grains. Besides hemp and flax, he experimented with 60 other crops including cotton and silk. He also derived income from a gristmill which produced cornmeal and flour for export and also ground neighbors' grain for fees. Washington similarly sold the services of the estate's looms and blacksmith. He built and operated a small fishing fleet, permitting Mount Vernon to export fish. Washington practiced the selective breeding of sheep in an effort to produce better quality wool. Washington was not as invested in animal husbandry as he was in cropping experiments, which were elaborate and included complex field rotations, nitrogen fixing crops and a range of soil amendments.<ref></ref> The Washington household consumed a wider range of protein sources than was typical for the Chesapeake population of his day, which consumed a great deal of beef.<ref></ref>
The new crops were less labor-intensive than tobacco; hence, the estate had a surplus of slaves. But Washington refused to break up families for sale. Washington began to hire skilled indentured servants from Europe to train the redundant slaves for service on and off the estate.<ref name="chernow2010"></ref>
Following his service in the war, Washington returned to Mount Vernon and in 1785–1786 spent a great deal of effort improving the landscaping of the estate. It is estimated that during his two terms as President of the United States (1789–1797), Washington spent a total of 434 days in residence at Mount Vernon. After his presidency, Washington tended to repairs to the buildings, socializing, and further gardening.
In his will, written several months before his death in December 1799, Washington left directions for the emancipation of all the slaves who belonged to him. Of the 317 slaves at Mount Vernon in 1799, a little less than half, 123 individuals, belonged to George Washington and were set free under the terms of his will.<ref name=will></ref> When Martha Washington's first husband, Daniel Parke Custis, died without a will, she received a life interest in one-third of his estate, including the slaves. Neither George nor Martha Washington could free these slaves by law. Upon her death, they reverted to the Custis estate and were divided among her grandchildren. By 1799, 153 slaves at Mount Vernon were part of this dower property.<ref name="will" /> In accordance with state law, George Washington stipulated in his will that elderly slaves or those who were too sick to work were to be supported throughout their lives by his estate. Children without parents, or those whose families were too poor or indifferent to see to their education, were to be bound out (or apprenticed) to masters and mistresses who would teach them reading, writing, and a useful trade, until they were ultimately freed at the age of twenty-five.<ref name="will" /> In December 1800, Martha Washington signed a deed of manumission for her deceased husband's slaves, a transaction which is recorded in the abstracts of the Fairfax County, Virginia, Court Records. The slaves finally received their freedom on 1 January 1801.<ref name="will" />
