Nectocaris

== Anatomy ==
Nectocaris had a flattened, kite-shaped body with a fleshy fin running along the length of each side.<ref name=SmithAndCaron2010/> The small head had two stalked eyes, a single pair of tentacles, and a flexible funnel opening out to the underside of the body.<ref name=SmithAndCaron2010/> The funnel often gets wider away from the head. Internally, a chamber runs along the body axis, containing a pair of gills; the gills comprise blades emerging from a zig-zag axis. Muscle blocks surrounded the axial cavity, and are now preserved as dark blocks in the lateral body.<ref name="Smith2013c"/> The fins also show dark blocks, with fine striations superimposed over them. These striations often stand in high relief above the rock surface itself.<ref name="Smith2013c"/>
== Diversity ==
Although Nectocaris is known from Canada, China and Australia, in rocks spanning some 20&nbsp;million years, there does not seem to be much diversity; size excepted, all specimens are anatomically very similar. Historically, three genera have been erected for nectocaridid taxa from different localities, but these 'species' – Petalilium latus and Vetustovermis planus – likely belong to the same genus or even the same species as N.&nbsp;pteryx. Within N.&nbsp;pteryx, there seem to be two discrete morphs, one large (~10&nbsp;cm in length), one small (~3&nbsp;cm long). These perhaps represent sexual dimorphism.<ref name="Smith2013c"/>
== Ecology ==
The unusual shape of the nectocaridid funnel has led to its interpretation as an eversible proboscis, but this is difficult to reconcile with the fossil evidence. Instead, its fluid dynamics seem optimal for a role in jet propulsion, where it would have maintained an efficient slow flow of water over the large internal gills.<ref name="Smith2013c"/> The eyes of Nectocaris would have had a similar visual acuity to modern Nautilus (if they lacked a lens) or squid (if they did not).<ref name="Smith2013c"/>
== Affinity ==
The affinity of Nectocaris has been a controversial subject, and some scientists feel that it is still uncertain.<ref name=Runnegar2011/><ref name=Kroger2011/> The balance of evidence seems to suggest a relationship with the cephalopods, whether in an ancestral or derived position.<ref name="Smith2013c"/> The most pleasing interpretation – which is not without problems – is to interpret some of the features of Nectocaris as shared with the earliest cephalopods. Features that seem to be shared with the modern coleoids (which evolved much later) can then be attributed to convergence – but perhaps using the same underlying genetic machinery as modern coleoids do today.<ref name="Smith2013c"/>
==History of study==
Nectocaris has a long and convoluted history of study. Charles Doolittle Walcott, the discoverer of the Burgess Shale, had photographed the one specimen he had collected in the 1910s, but never had time to investigate it further. As such, it was not until 1976 that Nectocaris was formally described, by Simon Conway Morris.<ref name=SCM1976></ref>
Because the genus was originally known from a single, incomplete specimen and with no counterpart,<ref name="WonderfulLife"></ref> Conway Morris was unable to deduce its affinity. It had some features which were reminiscent of arthropods, but these could well have been convergently derived.<ref name=SCM1976/><ref name="Waggoner1996"></ref> Its fins were very unlike those of arthropods.<ref name=SCM1976/>
Working from photographs, the Italian palaeontologist Alberto Simonetta believed he could classify Nectocaris within the chordates.<ref name=Simonetta1988></ref> He focussed mainly on the tail and fin morphology, interpreting Conway Morris's 'gut' as a notochord – a distinctive chordate feature.<ref name=Simonetta1988/>
The classification of Nectocaris was revisited in 2010, when Martin Smith and Jean-Bernard Caron described 91&nbsp;additional specimens, many of them better preserved than the type. These allowed them to reinterpret Nectocaris as a primitive cephalopod, with only 2&nbsp;tentacles instead of the 8 or 10&nbsp;limbs of modern cephalopods. The structure previous researchers had identified as an oval carapace or shield behind the eyes<ref name=SCM1989></ref> was suggested to be a soft funnel, similar to the ones used for propulsion by modern cephalopods. The interpretation would push back the origin of cephalopods by at least 30&nbsp;million years, much closer to the first appearance of complex animals, in the Cambrian explosion, and implied that &ndash; against the widespread expectation &ndash; cephalopods evolved from non-mineralized ancestors.<ref name=SmithAndCaron2010></ref>
A later analysis claimed to undermine the cephalopod interpretation, stating that it did not square with the established theory of cephalopod evolution.<ref name="Mazurek2011"></ref> According to these authors, Nectocaris is best treated as a member incertae sedis of the arthropod group Dinocaridida (which includes the anomalocaridids), but they stopped short of formally changing the classification.<ref name="Mazurek2011"/> However, it is straightforward to demonstrate that an anomalocaridid affinity is not supported.<ref name="Runnegar2011"></ref><ref name="Smith2011"></ref> Other studies have yet to put forward a more plausible affinity,<ref name="Runnegar2011" /><ref name=Kroger2011></ref> and alternatives to the cephalopod affinity are fraught with difficulties.<ref name="Smith2013c"></ref> Whether Nectocaris represents a derived or basal cephalopod, and whether it belongs in the Crown group, it is more parsimonious to interpret its distinctive features as homologues of their equivalent in cephalopods – even if the absence of a shell in Nectocaris is an independent feature.<ref name="Smith2013c"/>
===Vetustovermis===
Vetustovermis (from Latin: "very old worm")<ref name=Glaessner1979></ref> is a soft-bodied middle Cambrian animal, known from a single reported fossil specimen from the South Australian Emu Bay shale. It is probably a junior synonym of Nectocaris pteryx.<ref name="Smith2013c"/>
The original description of Vetustovermis hedged its bets regarding classification, but tentatively highlighted some similarities with the annelid worms.<ref name=Glaessner1979/> It was later considered an arthropod,<ref name=Luo1999></ref><ref></ref> and in 2010 Smith and Caron, agreeing that Petalilium was at least a close relative of Vetustovermis (but that treating it as a synonym was premature, given the poor preservation of the Vetustovermis type), placed it with Nectocaris in the clade Nectocarididae.<ref name="SmithAndCaron2010"/>
Early press reports misspelled the genus name as Vetustodermis.
===Petalilium===
Petalilium (sometimes misspelled Petalium)<ref name="Chen2005"></ref> is an enigmatic genus of Cambrian organism known from the Haikou area,<ref name=Steiner2005></ref> from the Maoshoiatan mudstone member of the Chengjiang biota.<ref name='Han2006'></ref> The taxon is a junior synonym of Nectocaris pteryx.<ref name="Smith2013c"/>
Fossils of Petalilium show a dorsoventrally flattened body, usually 5 to 6&nbsp;centimetres, but ranging from 1.5 to 10&nbsp;cm. It has an ovate trunk region and a large muscle foot, and a head with stalked eyes and a pair of long tentacles. The trunk region possesses about 50&nbsp;soft, flexible, transverse bars, lateral serialised structures of unknown function. The upper part of the body, interpreted as a mantle, is covered with a random array of spines on the back, while gills project underneath. A complete, tubular gut runs the length of the body.
Whilst it was originally described as a phyllocarid,<ref name=Luo1999/> and a ctenophore affinity has been suggested,<ref></ref> neither interpretation is supported by any compelling evidence.<ref name='Hu2007'></ref>
Some of the characters observed in Chen et al.'s (2005) study<ref name="Chen2005"/> suggested that Petalilium may be related to Nectocaris.<ref name="SmithAndCaron2010"/>

Nectocaris pteryx is a species of possible cephalopod<ref name=SmithAndCaron2010/> known from the "early Cambrian" (Series 2) Emu Bay Shale and Chengjiang biota, the "middle Cambrian" (Wuliuan) Burgess Shale.
Nectocaris was a free-swimming, predatory or scavenging organism. This lifestyle is reflected in its binomial name: Nectocaris means "swimming shrimp" (from the Ancient Greek , , meaning "swimmer" and , , "shrimp"; , , means "wing"). Two morphs are known: a small morph, about an inch long, and a large morph, anatomically identical but around four times longer.<ref name="Smith2013c"/>
The closely related Ordovician taxon Nectocotis is a second genus, closely resembling Nectocaris, but possessing an internal skeletal element.<ref name=Smith2019></ref>
