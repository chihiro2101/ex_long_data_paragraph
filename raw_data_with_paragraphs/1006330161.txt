==References==

Turner is a common surname originating from Normandy, France, arriving in England after the Norman conquest with the earliest known records dated in the 12th century. It is the 28th-most common surname in the United Kingdom.<ref name="surnamedb" /><ref name="ReaneyWilson1991"></ref>
Most often it derives from an occupational name applied to a maker of small objects out of wood, metal or bone, by turning on a lathe (from Old French tornier, "lathe", ultimately from Latin).<ref></ref> In this sense it is analogous to the German surnames Drexel, Drechsler, and Dreyer, Polish Tokarz, Finnish Sorvari and related to English surnames such as Potter and Crocker.<ref name="Smith1986"></ref><ref name="Hanks2003"></ref>
Other occasional origins include Old French tournoieur, referring to someone either in charge of, or who participates in a tournament, and Turnhare, referring to a fast runner (one who can outrun a hare).<ref name="BrowneReaney1991"></ref>
Early recordings of this surname include Ralph le Turner in the late 12th century. The earliest recorded spelling of this family name dates from 1180 for "Warner le Turnur".<ref name="surnamedb" />
