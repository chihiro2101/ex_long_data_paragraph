Saint David's Day

==Significance of the day==
Saint David was born in Caerfai, south west Wales into an aristocratic family.<ref name=telegraph></ref><ref name=bbc></ref> He was reportedly a scion of the royal house of Ceredigion,<ref></ref> and founded a Celtic monastic community at Glyn Rhosyn (The Vale of Roses) on the western headland of Pembrokeshire at the spot where St David's Cathedral stands today.<ref></ref>
David's fame as a teacher and his asceticism spread among Celtic Christians, and he helped found about 12 monasteries.<ref name=telegraph/> His foundation at Glyn Rhosyn became an important Christian shrine,<ref></ref> and the most important centre in Wales. The date of Saint David's death is believed to be 1 March 589.<ref></ref> His final words to the community of monks were: "Brothers be ye constant. The yoke which with single mind ye have taken, bear ye to the end; and whatsoever ye have seen with me and heard, keep and fulfil."<ref></ref>
For centuries, 1 March has been a national festival. Saint David was recognised as a national patron saint in the 12th century<ref name=bbc/> at a peak time of Welsh resistance to the Normans.<ref></ref> He was canonised by Pope Callixtus II in 1120. The 17th-century diarist Samuel Pepys noted how Welsh celebrations in London for Saint David's Day would spark wider counter-celebrations amongst their English neighbours: life-sized effigies of Welshmen were symbolically lynched,<ref></ref> and by the 18th century the custom had arisen of confectioners producing "taffies"—gingerbread figures baked in the shape of a Welshman riding a goat—on Saint David's Day.<ref>Simpson, Jacqueline and Steve Roud (2000), Oxford Dictionary of English Folklore, Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 307–8.</ref>
Unlike Saint Patrick's Day in Ireland, Saint David's Day is not a national holiday, though there is strong support for it becoming a bank holiday in Wales. In the past, schools have taken a half-day holiday, which continues in some parts of Wales. Saint David's Day is also celebrated in expatriate Welsh communities outside the UK.<ref name=telegraph/> Cross-party support resulted in the National Assembly for Wales voting unanimously to make Saint David's Day a public holiday in 2000. A poll conducted for Saint David's Day in 2006 found that 87% of people in Wales wanted it to be a bank holiday, with 65% prepared to sacrifice a different bank holiday to achieve this.<ref></ref> A petition in 2007 to make Saint David's Day a bank holiday was rejected by the office of the British Prime Minister Tony Blair.<ref></ref>
In the poem Armes Prydein (The Prophesy of Britain), composed in the early to mid-10th century, the anonymous author prophesies that the Cymry (the Welsh people) will unite and join an alliance of fellow-Celts<ref></ref> to repel the Anglo-Saxons, under the banner of Saint David: A lluman glân Dewi a ddyrchafant ("And they will raise the pure banner of Dewi").<ref>Ifor Williams (ed.), Armes Prydein (University of Wales Press, 1955), line 129.</ref> Although there were occasional Welsh uprisings in the Middle Ages, the country was briefly united by various Welsh princes before its conquest<ref>Gruffydd ap Llywelyn</ref> at different times, and it arguably had a very short period of independence during the rising of Owain Glyndŵr,<ref>Glyndŵr Rising</ref> but Wales as a whole was never an independent kingdom for long. Henry, Earl of Richmond, who was born in Pembroke Castle as a patrilineal descendant of the Tudors of Penmynydd#Lineage, became King Henry VII of England after his victory over Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, to end the Wars of the Roses.<ref></ref> Henry's green and white banner with a red dragon became a rallying point for Welsh patriotism with the memory of Saint David on his Feast Day. Henry was the first monarch of the House of Tudor, and during the reign of that dynasty the royal coat of arms included the Welsh Dragon, a reference to the monarch's origin. The banner from Henry's victory was not adopted as the official Flag of Wales until 1959.<ref></ref> The flag of Saint David, however, a golden cross on a black background, was not part of the symbolism of House of Tudor.<ref></ref>

==Traditions==
Children in Wales take part in school concerts or eisteddfodau, with recitation and singing being the main activities. Formerly, schoolchildren were given a half-day holiday. Officially this custom does not continue, although the practice can vary between schools.<ref name=telegraph/> The younger girls sometimes wear traditional Welsh costumes to school. This costume consists of a long woollen skirt, apron, white blouse, woollen shawl and a Welsh hat.<ref name=telegraph/>
Also, various Welsh Regiments of the British Army use aspects of Saint David's cross, Saint David himself, or songs of Saint David in their formalities during the celebrations. Many Welsh people wear one or both of the National symbols of Wales to celebrate St. David: the daffodil (a generic Welsh symbol) or the leek (Saint David's personal symbol) on this day.<ref name=telegraph/> The leek arises from an occasion when a troop of Welsh were able to distinguish each other from a troop of English enemy (some historical accounts indicate Saxon invading forces), dressed in similar fashion, by wearing leeks.<ref></ref>
The flag of Saint David often plays a central role in the celebrations and can be seen flying throughout Wales. Popular dishes traditionally eaten on Saint David's Day include cawl (soup), Bara brith tea loaf, Welsh cake, Welsh lamb and Welsh rarebit.<ref name=telegraph/>

Saint David's Day or ; , or the Feast of Saint David, is the feast day of Saint David, the patron saint of Wales, and falls on 1 March, the date of Saint David's death in 589 AD. The feast has been regularly celebrated since the Canonization of David in the 12th century, by Pope Callixtus II, though it is not a public holiday in the UK.
Traditional festivities include wearing daffodils and leeks, recognised symbols of Wales and Saint David respectively, eating traditional Welsh food including cawl and Welsh rarebit, and women wearing traditional Welsh dress. An increasing number of cities and towns across Wales including Cardiff, Swansea and Aberystwyth also put on parades throughout the day.
