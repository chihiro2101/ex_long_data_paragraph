Saturnalia

==Origins==
In Roman mythology, Saturn was an agricultural deity who was said to have reigned over the world in the Golden Age, when humans enjoyed the spontaneous bounty of the earth without labour in a state of innocence. The revelries of Saturnalia were supposed to reflect the conditions of the lost mythical age. The Greek equivalent was the Kronia,<ref name="Hansen2002"></ref> which was celebrated on the twelfth day of the month of Hekatombaion,<ref name="Bremmer"></ref><ref name="Hansen2002"/> which occurred from around mid-July to mid-August on the Attic calendar.<ref name="Hansen2002"/><ref name="Bremmer"/> The Greek writer Athenaeus also cites numerous other examples of similar festivals celebrated throughout the Greco-Roman world,<ref name="Parker"></ref> including the Crete festival of Hermaia in honor of Hermes, an unnamed festival from Troezen in honor of Poseidon, the Thessaly festival of Peloria in honor of Zeus Pelorios, and an unnamed festival from Babylon.<ref name="Parker"/> He also mentions that the custom of masters dining with their slaves was associated with the Athenian festival of Anthesteria and the Spartan festival of Hyacinthia.<ref name="Parker"/> The Argive festival of Hybristica, though not directly related to the Saturnalia, involved a similar reversal of roles in which women would dress as men and men would dress as women.<ref name="Parker"/>
The ancient Roman historian Justinus credits Saturn with being a historical king of the Aborigines (mythology) : 
===Role reversal===
Saturnalia was characterized by role reversals and behavioral license.<ref name="Parker"/> Slaves were treated to a banquet of the kind usually enjoyed by their masters.<ref name="Parker"/> Ancient sources differ on the circumstances: some suggest that master and slave dined together,<ref>Seneca, Epistulae 47.14; Carlin A. Barton, The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans: The Gladiator and the Monster (Princeton University Press, 1993), p. 498.</ref> while others indicate that the slaves feasted first, or that the masters actually served the food. The practice might have varied over time.
Saturnalian license also permitted slaves to disrespect their masters without the threat of a punishment. It was a time for free speech: the Augustan poet Horace calls it "December liberty".<ref>Horace, Satires 2.7.4, libertas Decembri; </ref> In two satires set during the Saturnalia, Horace has a slave offer sharp criticism to his master.<ref>Horace, Satires, Book 2, poems 3 and 7; Catherine Keane, Figuring Genre in Roman Satire (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 90; Maria Plaza, The Function of Humour in Roman Verse Satire: Laughing and Lying (Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 298–300 et passim.</ref> Everyone knew, however, that the leveling of the social hierarchy was temporary and had limits; no social norms were ultimately threatened, because the holiday would end.<ref>Barton, The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans, passim.</ref>
The toga, the characteristic garment of the male Roman citizen, was set aside in favor of the Greek synthesis, colourful "dinner clothes" otherwise considered in poor taste for daytime wear.<ref> (especially note 59).</ref> Romans of citizen status normally went about bare-headed, but for the Saturnalia donned the pilleus, the conical felt cap that was the usual mark of a freedman. Slaves, who ordinarily were not entitled to wear the pilleus, wore it as well, so that everyone was "pilleated" without distinction.
The participation of freeborn Roman women is implied by sources that name gifts for women, but their presence at banquets may have depended on the custom of their time; from the late Republic onward, women mingled socially with men more freely than they had in earlier times. Female entertainers were certainly present at some otherwise all-male gatherings. Role-playing was implicit in the Saturnalia's status reversals, and there are hints of mask-wearing or "guising".<ref>At the beginning of Horace's Satire 2.3, and the mask in the Saturnalia imagery of the Calendar of Philocalus, and Martial's inclusion of masks as Saturnalia gifts</ref> No theatrical events are mentioned in connection with the festivities, but the classicist Erich Segal saw Roman comedy, with its cast of impudent, free-wheeling slaves and libertine seniors, as imbued with the Saturnalian spirit.<ref>Erich Segal, Roman Laughter: The Comedy of Plautus (Oxford University Press, 1968, 2nd ed. 1987), pp. 8–9, 32–33, 103 et passim.</ref>
===Gambling===
Gambling and dice-playing, normally prohibited or at least frowned upon, were permitted for all, even slaves. Coins and nuts were the stakes. On the Calendar of Philocalus, the Saturnalia is represented by a man wearing a fur-trimmed coat next to a table with dice, and a caption reading: "Now you have license, slave, to game with your master."<ref> citing Suetonius, Life of Augustus 71; Martial 1.14.7, 5.84, 7.91.2, 11.6, 13.1.7; 14.1; Lucian, urltoken Saturnalia 1.</ref><ref>See urltoken a copy of the actual calendar</ref> Rampant overeating and drunkenness became the rule, and a sober person the exception.<ref>, citing Cato the Elder, De agricultura 57; Aulus Gellius 2.24.3; Martial 14.70.1 and 14.1.9; Horace, Satire 2.3.5; Lucian, Saturnalia 13; Scriptores Historiae Augustae, Alexander Severus 37.6.</ref>
Seneca looked forward to the holiday, if somewhat tentatively, in a letter to a friend:
<blockquote>"It is now the month of December, when the greatest part of the city is in a bustle. Loose reins are given to public dissipation; everywhere you may hear the sound of great preparations, as if there were some real difference between the days devoted to Saturn and those for transacting business. … Were you here, I would willingly confer with you as to the plan of our conduct; whether we should eve in our usual way, or, to avoid singularity, both take a better supper and throw off the toga."<ref>Seneca the Younger, Epistulae 18.1–2.</ref></blockquote>
Some Romans found it all a bit much. Pliny describes a secluded suite of rooms in his Laurentum villa, which he used as a retreat: ".especially during the Saturnalia when the rest of the house is noisy with the licence of the holiday and festive cries. This way I don't hamper the games of my people and they don't hinder my work or studies."<ref>Pliny the Younger, Letters 2.17.24. Horace similarly sets Satire 2.3 during the Saturnalia but in the countryside, where he has fled the frenzied pace.</ref>
===Gift-giving===
The Sigillaria on 19 December was a day of gift-giving.<ref> Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.10.24, seems to indicate that the Sigillaria was a market that occurred at the end of Saturnalia, but the Gallo-Roman scholar-poet Ausonius (Eclogues 16.32) refers to it as a religious occasion (sacra sigillorum, "rites of the sigillaria").</ref> Because gifts of value would mark social status contrary to the spirit of the season, these were often the pottery or wax figurines called sigillaria made specially for the day, candles, or "gag gifts", of which Augustus was particularly fond.<ref>Suetonius, Life of Augustus urltoken 75; , pointing to the urltoken Cronosolon of Lucian on the problem of unequal gift-giving.</ref> Children received toys as gifts.<ref>Beryl Rawson, "Adult-Child Relationships in Ancient Rome," in Marriage, Divorce, and Children in Ancient Rome (Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 19.</ref> In his many poems about the Saturnalia, Martial names both expensive and quite cheap gifts, including writing tablets, dice, knucklebones, moneyboxes, combs, toothpicks, a hat, a hunting knife, an axe, various lamps, balls, perfumes, pipes, a pig, a sausage, a parrot, tables, cups, spoons, items of clothing, statues, masks, books, and pets.<ref>Martial, Epigrams 13 and 14, the Xenia and the Apophoreta, published 84–85 AD.</ref> Gifts might be as costly as a slave or exotic animal,<ref> citing Martial 5.18, 7.53, 14; Suetonius, Life of Augustus 75 and Life of Vespasian 19 on the range of gifts.</ref> but Martial suggests that token gifts of low intrinsic value inversely measure the high quality of a friendship.<ref>Ruurd R. Nauta, Poetry for Patrons: Literary Communication in the Age of Domitian (Brill, 2002), pp. 78–79.</ref> Patrons or "bosses" might pass along a gratuity (sigillaricium) to their poorer clients or dependents to help them buy gifts. Some emperors were noted for their devoted observance of the Sigillaria.<ref>, citing Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.10.24 and 1.11.49; Suetonius, Life of Claudius 5; Scriptores Historiae Augustae Hadrian urltoken 17.3, Caracalla urltoken 1.8 and Aurelian urltoken 50.3. See also </ref>
In a practice that might be compared to modern greeting cards, verses sometimes accompanied the gifts. Martial has a collection of poems written as if to be attached to gifts.<ref>Martial, Book 14 (Apophoreta); Williams, Martial: Epigrams, p. 259; Nauta, Poetry for Patrons, p. 79 et urltoken passim.</ref> Catullus received a book of bad poems by "the worst poet of all time" as a joke from a friend.<ref>Catullus, Carmen 14; Robinson Ellis, A Commentary on Catullus (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1876), pp. 38–39.</ref>
Gift-giving was not confined to the day of the Sigillaria. In some households, guests and family members received gifts after the feast in which slaves had shared.
===King of the Saturnalia===
Imperial sources refer to a Saturnalicius princeps ("Ruler of the Saturnalia"), who ruled as master of ceremonies for the proceedings. He was appointed by lot, and has been compared to the medieval Lord of Misrule at the Feast of Fools. His capricious commands, such as "Sing naked!" or "Throw him into cold water!", had to be obeyed by the other guests at the convivium: he creates and (mis)rules a chaotic and absurd world. The future emperor Nero is recorded as playing the role in his youth.<ref>By Tacitus, Annales 13.15.</ref>
Since this figure does not appear in accounts from the Roman Republic, the princeps of the Saturnalia may have developed as a satiric response to the new era of rule by a princeps, the title assumed by the first emperor Augustus to avoid the hated connotations of the word "king" (rex). Art and literature under Augustus celebrated his reign as a new Golden Age, but the Saturnalia makes a mockery of a world in which law is determined by one man and the traditional social and political networks are reduced to the power of the emperor over his subjects. In a poem about a lavish Saturnalia under Domitian, Statius makes it clear that the emperor, like Jupiter, still reigns during the temporary return of Saturn.<ref>Statius, Silvae 1.6; Nauta, Poetry for Patrons, p. 400.</ref>
===Io Saturnalia===
The phrase io Saturnalia was the characteristic shout or salutation of the festival, originally commencing after the public banquet on the single day of 17 December. The interjection io (Greek ἰώ, ǐō) is pronounced either with two syllables (a short i and a long o) or as a single syllable (with the i becoming the Latin consonantal j and pronounced yō). It was a strongly emotive ritual exclamation or invocation, used for instance in announcing triumph or celebrating Bacchus, but also to punctuate a joke.<ref>Entry on io, Oxford Latin Dictionary (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982, 1985 reprinting), p. 963.</ref>
==On the calendar==
As an observance of state religion, Saturnalia was supposed to have been held ante diem xvi Kalendas Ianuarias, sixteen days before the Kalends of January, on the oldest Roman calendar, which the Romans believed to have been established by the legendary founder Romulus and his successor Numa Pompilius. It was a dies festus, a legal holiday when no public business could be conducted. The day marked the dedication anniversary (dies natalis) of the Temple to Saturn in the Roman Forum in 497 BC. When Julius Caesar had the Julian calendar because it had fallen out of synchronization with the solar year, two days were added to the month, and Saturnalia fell on 17 December. It was felt, however, that the original day had thus been moved by two days, and so Saturnalia was celebrated under Augustus as a three-day official holiday encompassing both dates.<ref>Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.10.23; ; Fowler, Roman Festivals, p. 268; Carole E. Newlands, "The Emperor's Saturnalia: Statius, Silvae 1.6," in Flavian Rome: Culture, Image, Text (Brill, 2003), p. 505.</ref>
By the late Republic, the private festivities of Saturnalia had expanded to seven days,<ref>Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.10.3, citing the Atellane composers Novius and Mummius</ref> but during the Imperial period contracted variously to three to five days.<ref>Miller, "Roman Festivals," in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome, p. 172.</ref> Caligula extended official observances to five.<ref>Suetonius, Life of Caligula 17; Cassius Dio 59.6.4; ; Fowler, Roman Festivals, p. 268, citing Mommsen and CIL I.337.</ref>
The date 17 December was the first day of the Capricorn (astrology), the house of Saturn named for the god.<ref>Fowler, Roman Festivals, p. 268, note 3; Roger Beck, "Ritual, Myth, Doctrine, and Initiation in the Mysteries of Mithras: New Evidence from a Cult Vessel," Journal of Roman Studies 90 (2000), p. 179.</ref> Its proximity to the winter solstice (21 to 23 December on the Julian calendar) was endowed with various meanings by both ancient and modern scholars: for instance, the widespread use of wax candles (cerei, singular cereus) could refer to "the returning power of the sun's light after the solstice".<ref>Fowler, Roman Festivals, p. 272. Fowler thought the use of candles influenced the Christmas rituals of the Latin Church, and compared the symbolism of the candles to the Yule log.</ref>
==Ancient theological and philosophical views==
===Roman===
The Saturnalia reflects the contradictory nature of the deity Saturn himself: "There are joyful and utopian aspects of careless well-being side by side with disquieting elements of threat and danger."
As a deity of agricultural bounty, Saturn embodied prosperity and wealth in general. The name of his consort Ops meant "wealth, resources". Her festival, Opalia, was celebrated on 19 December. The Temple of Saturn housed the state treasury (aerarium) and was the administrative headquarters of the quaestors, the public officials whose duties included oversight of the mint. It was among the oldest cult sites in Rome, and had been the location of "a very ancient" altar (ara) even before the building of the first temple in 497 BC.<ref>Fowler, Roman Festivals, p. 271.</ref>
The Romans regarded Saturn as the original and autochthonous ruler of the Capitolium,<ref>The Capitolium had thus been called the Mons Saturnius in older times.</ref> and the first king of Latium or even the whole of Italy. At the same time, there was a tradition that Saturn had been an immigrant deity, received by Janus after he was usurped by his son Jupiter (Zeus) and expelled from Greece.<ref> The Roman theologian Varro listed Saturn among the Sabine gods.</ref> His contradictions—a foreigner with one of Rome's oldest sanctuaries, and a god of liberation who is kept in fetters most of the year—indicate Saturn's capacity for obliterating social distinctions.
Roman mythology of the Golden Age of Saturn's reign differed from the Greek tradition. He arrived in Italy "dethroned and fugitive",<ref>Versnel, "Saturnus and the Saturnalia," p. 143.</ref> but brought agriculture and civilization and became a king. As the Augustan poet Virgil described it: <blockquote>"He gathered together the unruly race of fauns and nymphs scattered over mountain heights, and gave them laws … . Under his reign were the golden ages men tell of: in such perfect peace he ruled the nations."<ref>Virgil, Aeneid 8. 320–325, as cited by </ref></blockquote>
The third century Neoplatonic philosopher Porphyry took an allegorical view of the Saturnalia. He saw the festival's theme of liberation and dissolution as representing the "freeing of souls into immortality"—an interpretation that Mithraists may also have followed, since they included many slaves and freedmen.<ref>Porphyry, De antro 23, following Numenius, as cited by Roger Beck, "Qui Mortalitatis Causa Convenerunt: The Meeting of the Virunum Mithraists on June 26, A.D. 184," Phoenix 52 (1998), p. 340. One of the speakers in Macrobius's Saturnalia is Vettius Agorius Praetextatus, a Mithraist.</ref> According to Porphyry, the Saturnalia occurred near the winter solstice because the sun enters Capricorn, the House (astrology) of Saturn, at that time.<ref>Beck, Roger, "Ritual, Myth, Doctrine, and Initiation in the Mysteries of Mithras: New Evidence from a Cult Vessel," Journal of Roman Studies 90 (2000), p. 179.</ref> In the Saturnalia (Macrobius), the proximity of the Saturnalia to the winter solstice leads to an exposition of solar monotheism, the belief that the Sun (see Sol Invictus) ultimately encompasses all divinities as one.<ref>Roel van den Broek, "The Sarapis Oracle in Macrobius Sat., I, 20, 16–17," in Hommages à Maarten J. Vermaseren (Brill, 1978), vol. 1, p. 123ff.</ref>
===Jewish===
The Mishna and Talmud (Avodah Zara 8a) describe a pagan festival called Saturnura which occurs for eight days before the winter solstice. It is followed for eight days after the solstice with a festival called Kalenda culminating with the Kalends of January. The Talmud ascribes the origins of this festival to Adam, who saw that the days were getting shorter and thought it was punishment for his sin. He was afraid that the world was returning to the chaos and emptiness that existed before creation. He sat and fasted for eight days. Once he saw that the days were getting longer again he realized that this was the natural cycle of the world, so made eight days of celebration. The Talmud states that this festival was later turned into a pagan festival. Later on in the page, the Talmud calls it Saturnalia. <ref> urltoken A portion of Avodah Zarah 8, quoted in Menachem Leibtag's Chanuka – Its Biblical Roots – Part Two, hosted on urltoken The Tanach Study Center</ref><ref> urltoken A portion of Avodah Zarah 8, quoted in Ebn Leader's The Darkness of Winter – Environmental reflections on Hanukah , hosted on urltoken The Kibbutz Institute for Holidays and Jewish Culture.</ref> See Christmas#Talmudic_hypothesis.
==Influence==
Unlike several Roman religious festivals which were particular to cult sites in the city, the prolonged seasonal celebration of Saturnalia at home could be held anywhere in the Empire.<ref>Greg Woolf , "Found in Translation: The Religion of the Roman Diaspora," in Ritual Dynamics and Religious Change in the Roman Empire. Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop of the International Network Impact of Empire (Heidelberg, July 5–7, 2007) (Brill, 2009), p. 249.

As a result of the close proximity of dates, many Christians in western Europe continued to celebrate traditional Saturnalia customs in association with Christmas and the surrounding holidays.<ref name="John"/><ref name="Forbes"></ref><ref name="GraftonMostSettis"/> Like Saturnalia, Christmas during the Middle Ages was a time of ruckus, drinking, gambling, and overeating.<ref name="GraftonMostSettis"/> The tradition of the Saturnalicius princeps was particularly influential.<ref name="Forbes"/><ref name="GraftonMostSettis"/> In medieval France and Switzerland, a boy would be elected "Boy bishop " on 28 December (the Feast of the Holy Innocents)<ref name="Forbes"/><ref name="GraftonMostSettis"/> and would issue decrees much like the Saturnalicius princeps.<ref name="Forbes"/><ref name="GraftonMostSettis"/> The boy bishop's tenure ended during the evening vespers.<ref name="Mackenzie"></ref> This custom was common across western Europe, but varied considerably by region;<ref name="Mackenzie"/> in some places, the boy bishop's orders could become quite rowdy and unrestrained,<ref name="Mackenzie"/> but, in others, his power was only ceremonial.<ref name="Mackenzie"/> In some parts of France, during the boy bishop's tenure, the actual clergy would wear masks or dress in women's clothing, a reversal of roles in line with the traditional character of Saturnalia.<ref name="GraftonMostSettis"/>
During the Late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, many towns in England elected a "Lord of Misrule" at Christmas time to preside over the Feast of Fools.<ref name="Forbes"/><ref name="GraftonMostSettis"/> This custom was sometimes associated with the Twelfth Night or Epiphany.<ref></ref> A common tradition in western Europe was to drop a Bean-feast ;<ref name="Forbes"/> whoever found the object would become the "King (or Queen) of the Bean".<ref name="Forbes"/> During the Reformation , reformers sought to revise or even completely abolish such practices, which they regarded as "popish";<ref name="GraftonMostSettis"/> these efforts were largely successful and, in many places, these customs died out completely.<ref name="GraftonMostSettis"/><ref name="Jeffrey"></ref> The Puritans banned the "Lord of Misrule" in England<ref name="Jeffrey"/> and the custom was largely forgotten shortly thereafter, though the bean in the pudding survived as a tradition of a small gift to the one finding a single almond hidden in the traditional Christmas porridge in Scandinavia.<ref name="Jeffrey"/><ref></ref>
Nonetheless, in the middle of the nineteenth century, some of the old ceremonies, such as gift-giving, were revived in English-speaking countries as part of a widespread "Christmas revival".<ref name="GraftonMostSettis"/><ref name="Jeffrey"/><ref name="Rowel1993"></ref> During this revival, authors such as Charles Dickens sought to reform the "conscience of Christmas" and turn the formerly riotous holiday into a family-friendly occasion.<ref name="Rowel1993"/> Vestiges of the Saturnalia festivities may still be preserved in some of the traditions now associated with Christmas.<ref name="GraftonMostSettis"/><ref name="Stuttard2012"></ref> The custom of gift-giving at Christmas time resembles the Roman tradition of giving sigillaria<ref name="Stuttard2012"/> and the lighting of Advent candles resembles the Roman tradition of lighting torches and wax tapers.<ref name="Stuttard2012"/><ref name="Forbes"/> Likewise, Saturnalia and Christmas both share associations with eating, drinking, singing, and dancing.<ref name="Stuttard2012"/><ref name="Forbes"/>

Saturnalia was an Roman festival and holiday in honour of the god Saturn, held on 17 December of the Julian calendar and later expanded with festivities through to 23 December. The holiday was celebrated with a sacrifice at the Temple of Saturn, in the Roman Forum, and a public banquet, followed by private gift-giving, continual partying, and a carnival atmosphere that overturned Roman social norms: gambling was permitted, and masters provided table service for their slaves as it was seen as a time of liberty for both slaves and freedmen alike.<ref>Miller, John F. "Roman Festivals," in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 172.</ref> A common custom was the election of a "King of the Saturnalia", who would give orders to people, which were to be followed and preside over the merrymaking. The gifts exchanged were usually gag gifts or small figurines made of wax or pottery known as sigillaria. The poet Catullus called it "the best of days".<ref>Catullus 14.15 (optimo dierum), as cited by </ref>
Saturnalia was the Roman equivalent to the earlier Greek holiday of Kronia, which was celebrated during the Attic month of Hekatombaion in late midsummer. It held theological importance for some Romans, who saw it as a restoration of the ancient Golden Age, when the world was ruled by Saturn. The Neoplatonism philosopher Porphyry interpreted the freedom associated with Saturnalia as symbolizing the "freeing of souls into immortality". Saturnalia may have influenced some of the customs associated with later celebrations in western Europe occurring in midwinter, particularly traditions associated with Christmas, the Feast of the Holy Innocents, and Epiphany. In particular, the historical western European Christmas custom of electing a "Lord of Misrule" may have its roots in Saturnalia celebrations.
