==Historical Landmark<ref></ref>==
The Island View School, located on Boydâ€™s Creek Highway, is a wooden one room schoolhouse that operated between 1917 and 1949. It held between 35-40 students and covered eight grade levels. The teacher made $50 a month and wore multiple hats: educator, principal, and janitor. The school would shut down during crop season due to the students having to help their families. 
The schoolhouse was restored by Dr. Sam Lyle and John Plummer. Lyle inherited the land from his grandfather. The schoolhouse holds sentimental value to Lyle due to his mother attending the school along with other family members. The family had been using the old schoolhouse to store hay until the building began to decay.
==Unsuccessful attempts to incorporate==
On multiple occasions, residents have met to discuss the possibility of incorporating as a town or city. The majority of residents have opposed incorporation, arguing it would bring higher taxes and expanded government, while others have argued the community would benefit from a community center, along with sidewalks that might be constructed with the added revenue.<ref>" urltoken Seymour Residents Meet to Discuss Incorporation ," WBIR.com, January 9, 2014.</ref> Some Blount County residents want their portion of the 37865 zip code to be included within the proposed city limits; however, the incorporation meeting was geared primarily toward the Sevier County portion of the community. In the end, the voters voted overwhelmingly to keep Seymour unincorporated.<ref>" urltoken Blount County Wants to be Part of Incorporated Seymour," Seymour Herald Newspaper, January 16, 2014.</ref>
