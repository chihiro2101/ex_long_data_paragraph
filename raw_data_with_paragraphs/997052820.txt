Conidae

==Current taxonomy==
In the Journal of Molluscan Studies, in 2014, Puillandre, Duda, Meyer, Olivera & Bouchet presented a new classification for the old genus Conus. Using 329 species, the authors carried out molecular phylogenetic analyses. The results suggested that the authors should place all living cone snails in a single family, Conidae, containing the following genera:
* Californiconus <small>J. K. Tucker & Tenorio, 2009</small>
* Conasprella <small>Thiele, 1929</small>
* † Conilithes <small>Swainson, 1840</small> 
* † Contraconus <small>Olsson & Harbison, 1953</small> 
* Conus <small>Linnaeus, 1758</small>
* † Eoconus <small>J. K. Tucker & Tenorio, 2009</small> 
* † Hemiconus <small>Cossmann, 1889</small> 
* † Herndliconus <small>Petuch & Drolshagen, 2015</small> 
* Kenyonia <small>Brazier, 1896</small>
* Lilliconus <small>G. Raybaudi Massilia, 1994</small>
* Malagasyconus <small>Monnier & Tenorio, 2015</small>
* † Papilliconus <small>Tracey & Craig, 2017</small> 
* Profundiconus <small>Kuroda, 1956</small>
* Pseudolilliconus <small>J. K. Tucker & Tenorio, 2009</small>
* Pygmaeconus <small>Puillandre & Tenorio, 2017</small>
* † Tequestaconus <small>Petuch & Drolshagen, 2015</small> †
The authors grouped 85% of all known cone snail species under Conus. They recognized 57 subgenera within Conus, and 11 subgenera within the genus Conasprella.<ref name="Puillandre"></ref>
==History of the taxonomy==
===Overview===
Prior to 1993, the family Conidae contained only Conus species. In 1993 significant taxonomic changes were proposed by Taylor, et al.,:<ref name="Taylor">Taylor J. D., Kantor Y. I. & Sysoev A. V. (1993). "Foregut anatomy, feeding mechanisms, relationships and classification of Conoidea (Toxoglossa) (Gastropoda)." Bull. Br. Mus. (Nat. Hist.) Zool. 59: 125–169.</ref> the family Conidae was redefined as several subfamilies. The subfamilies included many subfamilies that had previously been classified in the family Turridae, and the Conus species were moved to the subfamily Coninae.
In further taxonomic changes that took place in 2009 and 2011, based upon molecular phylogeny (see below), the subfamilies that were previously in the family Turridae were elevated to the status of families in their own right. This left the family Conidae once again containing only those species that were traditionally placed in that family: the cone snail species.
===1993, Taylor et al., Bouchet & Rocroi===
According to Taylor, et al. (1993),<ref name="Taylor" /> and the Taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005),<ref></ref> this family consisted of seven subfamilies.
* Coninae Fleming, 1822&nbsp;— synonyms: Conulinae Rafinesque, 1815 (inv.); Textiliinae da Motta, 1995 (n.a.)
* Clathurellinae H. Adams & A. Adams, 1858&nbsp;— synonyms: Defranciinae Gray, 1853 (inv.); Borsoniinae A. Bellardi, 1875; Pseudotominae A. Bellardi, 1888; Diptychomitrinae L. Bellardi, 1888; Mitrolumnidae Sacco, 1904; Mitromorphinae Casey, 1904; Lorinae Thiele, 1925
* Conorbiinae de Gregorio, 1880—synonym: Cryptoconinae Cossmann, 1896
* Mangeliinae P. Fischer, 1883—synonym: Cytharinae Thiele, 1929
* Oenopotinae Bogdanov, 1987—synonym: Lorinae Thiele, 1925 sensu Thiele
* Raphitominae A. Bellardi, 1875—synonyms: Daphnellinae Casey, 1904; Taraninae Casey, 1904; Thatcheriidae Powell, 1942; Pleurotomellinae F. Nordsieck, 1968; Andoniinae Vera-Pelaez, 2002
* † Siphopsinae Le Renard, 1995
===2009, Tucker & Tenorio===
In 2009 John K. Tucker and Manuel J. Tenorio proposed a classification system for the cone shells and their allies (which resorb their inner walls during growth) was based upon a cladistical analysis of anatomical characters including the Radula, the morphology (i.e., shell characters), as well as an analysis of prior molecular phylogeny studies, all of which were used to construct phylogenetic trees.<ref name="Systematic">Tucker J.K. & Tenorio M.J. (2009) Systematic classification of Recent and fossil conoidean gastropods. Hackenheim: Conchbooks. 296 pp., at p. 133</ref> In their phylogeny, Tucker and Tenorio noted the close relationship of the cone species within the various clades, corresponding to their proposed families and genera; this also corresponded to the results of prior molecular studies by Puillandre et al. and others.<ref name="Bandy">P.K.

===2011, Bouchet et al.===
In 2011 Bouchet et al. proposed a new classification in which several subfamilies were raised to the rank of family:<ref name="Bouchet 2011"></ref>
* Clathurellinae was split into three families: Borsoniidae (also including species from Turridae), Mitromorphidae and Clathurellidae (all previously lumped under the Turridae).<ref name="Bouchet 2011"/>
* Conorbiinae was raised to the rank of family Conorbidae, consisting of three genera: Artemidiconus da Motta, 1991, Benthofascis Iredale, 1936, and Conorbis Swainson, 1840.<ref name="Bouchet 2011"/>
* Mangeliinae and Oenopotinae were combined and raised to the rank of family Mangeliidae, which had previously been lumped in the Turridae).<ref name="Bouchet 2011"/>
* Raphitominae was raised to the rank of family Raphitomidae (also previously lumped in the Turridae).<ref name="Bouchet 2011"/>
The classification by Bouchet et al. (2011)<ref name="Bouchet 2011"/> was based on mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA testing, and built on the prior work by J.K. Tucker & M.J. Tenorio (2009), but did not include fossil taxa.<ref name="Systematic" /><ref name="Bouchet 2011"/>
Molecular phylogeny, particularly with the advent of nuclear DNA testing in addition to the mDNA testing (testing in the Conidae initially began by Christopher Meyer and Alan Kohn<ref>Interview of Professor Alan Kohn, Professor Emeritus, Zoology </ref>), is continuing on the Conidae.<ref name="Bandy" /><ref name="Williams" /><ref name="Cunha" /><ref name="Duda & Kohn" /><ref name="Duda & Rolan" /><ref name="Vallejo" /><ref name="Puillandre et al.">N.

===1993 to 2011 list of genera===
Following Taylor et al., from 1993 to 2011, the family Conidae was defined as including not only the cone snails, but also a large number of other genera which are commonly known as Turridae. However, as a result of molecular phylogeny studies in 2011, many of those genera were moved back to the Turridae, or were placed in new "turrid" families within the superfamily Conoidea. The following list of genera that used to be included in Conidae is retained as a historical reference:

==Cone snail venom characteristics and biotech==
There are approximately 30 records of humans killed by cone snails. Human victims suffer little pain, because the venom contains an analgesic component. Some species reportedly can kill a human in under five minutes, thus the name "cigarette snail" as supposedly one only has time to smoke a cigarette before dying. Cone snails can sting through a wetsuit with their harpoon-like radular tooth, which resembles a transparent needle.<ref></ref>
Normally, cone snails (and many species in the superfamily Conoidea) use their venom to immobilize prey before engulfing it. The venom consists of a mixture of peptides, called conopeptides. The venom is typically made up of 10 to 30 amino acids, but in some species as many as 60. The venom of each cone snail species may contain as many as 200 pharmacologically active components. It is estimated that more than 50,000 conopeptides can be found, because every species of cone snail is thought to produce its own specific venom.
Cone-snail venom has come to interest biotechnologists and pharmacists because of its potential medicinal properties. Production of synthetic conopeptides has started, using solid-phase peptide synthesis.
W-conopeptide, from the species Conus magus is the basis of the analgesic drug Prialt, an approved treatment for pain said to be 1000 times as powerful as morphine and used as a last resort in specific application. Conopeptides are also being looked at as anti-epileptic agents and to help stop nerve-cell death after a stroke or head injury. Conopeptides also have potential in helping against spasms due to spinal cord injuries, and may be helpful in diagnosing and treating small cell carcinomas in the lung.
The biotechnology surrounding cone snails and their venom has promise for medical breakthroughs; with more than 50,000 Conotoxin to study, the possibilities are numerous.<ref></ref>

Conidae (also previously referred to as Coninae), with the current common name of "cone snails," is a taxonomic family (previously subfamily) of predatory sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the superfamily Conoidea.
The 2014 classification of the superfamily Conoidea, groups only cone snails in the family Conidae. Some previous classifications grouped the cone snails in a subfamily, the Coninae.
As of March 2015 Conidae contained over 800 recognized species. Working in 18th-century Europe, Carl Linnaeus knew of only 30 species that are still considered valid.
The snails within this family are sophisticated predatory animals.<ref>Piper R. (2007). Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press.</ref> They hunt and immobilize prey using a modified radular tooth along with a venom gland containing neurotoxins; the tooth is launched out of the snail's mouth in a harpoon-like action.
Because all cone snails are venomous and capable of "stinging" humans, live ones should be handled with great care or preferably not at all.
