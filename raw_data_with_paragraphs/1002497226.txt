House of Burgesses

==Name==
Burgess originally referred to a freeman of a borough, a self-governing town or settlement in England.
==Early years==
The Colony of Virginia was founded by a joint-stock company, the Virginia Company, as a private venture- though under a royal charter. Early governors provided the stern leadership and harsh judgments required for the colony to survive its early difficulties.
Early crises with famine, disease, Native American raids, the need to establish cash crops, and lack of skilled or committed labor, meant the colony needed to attract enough new and responsible settlers if it were to grow and prosper.
To encourage settlers to come to Virginia, in November 1618 the Virginia Company's leaders gave instructions to the new governor, George Yeardley, which became known as "the great charter."<ref>

Emigrants who paid their own way to Virginia would receive fifty acres of land and not be mere tenants. Civil authority would control the military. In 1619, based on the instructions, Governor Yeardley initiated the election of 22 burgesses by the settlements and Jamestown. They, together with the royally-appointed Governor and six-member Council of State, would form the first General Assembly as a unicameral body.<ref name="Rubin3"/> 
The governor could veto its actions and the Company still maintained overall control of the venture, but the settlers would have a limited say in the management of their own affairs, including their finances.<ref name="Rubin3">Rubin, Jr. Louis D. Virginia: A History. New York W.W. Norton & Company, Inc., 1977; . pp. 3–27.</ref> 
A House of Assembly was created at the same time in Bermuda (which had also been settled by the Virginia Company, and was by then managed by its offshoot, the Somers Isles Company) and held its first session in 1620.
A handful of Poles craftsmen, brought to the colony to supply skill in the manufacture of pitch, tar, potash, and soap ash, were initially denied full political rights. They downed their tools in protest, but returned to work after being declared free and enfranchised, apparently by agreement with the Virginia Company.<ref></ref>
===First session===
On July 30, 1619, Governor Yeardley convened the General Assembly as the first One man, one vote in the Americas for a six-day meeting at the new brick church on Jamestown Island, Virginia. The unicameral Assembly was composed of the Governor, a Council of State appointed by the Virginia Company and the 22 locally elected representatives.<ref></ref><ref>Bosher, Kate Langley. urltoken The First House of Burgesses.

===Later 17th century===
Especially after the massacre of almost 400 colonists on March 22, 1621/22 by Native Americans, and epidemics in the winters before and after the massacre, the governor and council ruled arbitrarily, showing great contempt for the assembly and allowing no dissent.<ref></ref> 
By 1624, the royal government in London had heard enough about the problems of the colony and revoked the charter of the Virginia Company. Virginia became a crown colony and the governor and council would be appointed by the Crown. Nonetheless, the Assembly maintained management of local affairs with some informal royal assent, although it was not royally confirmed until 1639.<ref name="Rubin3"/>
In 1634, the General Assembly divided the colony into eight shires (later renamed counties) for purposes of government, administration, and the judicial system. By 1643, the expanding colony had 15 counties. All of the county offices, including a board of commissioners, judges, sheriff, constable and clerks, were appointed positions. Only the burgesses were elected by a vote of the people. Women had no right to vote. Only free and white men originally were given the right to vote, by 1670 only property owners were allowed to vote.<ref name="Rubin3"/>
In 1642, Governor William Berkeley urged creation of a Bicameralism, which the Assembly promptly implemented; the House of Burgesses was thus formed and met separately from the Council of State.<ref></ref>
In 1652, the parliamentary forces of Oliver Cromwell forced the colony to submit to being taken over by the English government. Again, the colonists were able to retain the General Assembly as their governing body. Only taxes agreed to by the assembly were to be levied. Still, most Virginia colonists were loyal to Prince Charles, and were pleased at his restoration as King Charles II in 1660. He went on directly or indirectly to restrict some of the liberties of the colonists, such as requiring tobacco to be shipped only to England, only on English ships, with the price set by the English merchant buyers;<ref>Rubin, 1977, p. 19.</ref> but the General Assembly remained.<ref name="Rubin3"/>
A majority of the members of the General Assembly of 1676 were supporters of Nathaniel Bacon. They enacted legislation designed to further popular sovereignty and representative government and to equalize opportunities.<ref>Rubin, 1977, p. 25.</ref> Bacon took little part in the deliberations since he was busy fighting the Native Americans.<ref>Rubin, 1977, p. 26.</ref>
The statehouse in Jamestown burned down for the fourth time on October 20, 1698. The General Assembly met temporarily in Middle Plantation, inland from Jamestown, and then in 1699 permanently moved the capital of the colony to Middle Plantation, which they renamed Williamsburg.<ref>Rubin, 1977. p. 29.</ref>
==Moving toward independence==
The French and Indian War in North America from 1754 to 1763 resulted in local colonial losses and economic disruption. Higher taxes were to follow, and adverse local reactions to these and how they were determined would drive events well into the next decade.<ref name="Anderson"></ref>
In 1764, desiring revenue from its North American colonies, Parliament passed the first law specifically aimed at raising colonial money for the Crown. The Sugar Act increased duties on non-British goods shipped to the colonies.<ref name=Johnson></ref> The same year, the Currency Act prohibited American colonies from issuing their own currency.<ref name=Greene></ref> These angered many American colonists and began colonial opposition with protests. By the end of the year, many colonies were practicing non-importation, a refusal to use imported British goods.<ref name="Johnson"/> 
In 1765, the British Quartering Act, which required the colonies to provide barracks and supplies to British troops, further angered American colonists; and to raise more money for Britain, Parliament enacted the Stamp Act on the American colonies, to tax newspapers, almanacs, pamphlets, broadsides, legal documents, dice, and playing cards.<ref name=LOC></ref> American colonists responded to Parliament's acts with organized protest throughout the colonies. A network of secret organizations known as the Sons of Liberty was created to intimidate the stamp agents collecting the taxes, and before the Stamp Act could take effect, all the appointed stamp agents in the colonies had resigned.<ref name=ushistory></ref> The Massachusetts Assembly suggested a meeting of all colonies to work for the repeal of the Stamp Act, and all but four colonies were represented.<ref name=Rothbard></ref> The colonists also increased their non-importation efforts,<ref> urltoken America During the Age of Revolution, 1764–1765, Library of Congress</ref> and sought to increase in local production.
In May 1765, Patrick Henry presented a series of resolves that became known as the Virginia Resolves, denouncing the Stamp Act and denying the authority of the British parliament to tax the colonies, since they were No taxation without representation. Newspapers around the colonies published all his resolves, even the most radical ones which had not been passed by the assembly.<ref>#Wood, p.14</ref> The assembly also sent a 1768 Petition, Memorial, and Remonstrance to Parliament.
From 1769 -1775 Thomas Jefferson represented Albemarle County as a delegate in the Virginia House of Burgesses.<ref>

The House of Burgesses was the elected representative element of the Virginia General Assembly, the legislative body of the Colony of Virginia. With the creation of the House of Burgesses in 1642, the General Assembly, which had been established in 1619, became a bicameral institution.
From 1642 to 1776, the House of Burgesses was an instrument of government alongside the royally-appointed colonial governor and the upper-house Council of State in the General House.<ref></ref>
When the Virginia colony declared its independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain at the Fifth Virginia Convention in 1776 and became the independent Virginia, the House of Burgesses became the House of Delegates, which continues to serve as the lower house of the General Assembly.<ref name="Gottlieb"></ref>
