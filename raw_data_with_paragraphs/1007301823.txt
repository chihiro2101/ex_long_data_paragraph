Microstate

== Definitions ==
Most scholars identify microstates by using a quantitative threshold and applying it to either one variable (such as the size of its territory<ref>Mehmet, O. & Tahiroglu, M., 2002. Growth and equity in microstates: Does size matter in development? International Journal of Social Economics, 29(1/2), pp.152–162.</ref> or population<ref>Boyce, P.J. & Herr, R.A., 2008. Microstate diplomacy in the south pacific. Australian Outlook, (April 2012), pp.37–41.</ref>) or a composite of different variables.<ref>Reid, G.L., 1975. Impact of Very Small Size on the International Behaviour of Microstates (International Studies), SAGE Publications Ltd.</ref> While it is agreed that microstates are the smallest of all states, there is no consensus on what variable (or variables) or what cut-off point should be used to determine which political units should be labelled as "microstates" (as opposed to small "normal" states).<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2">Neemia, U., 1995.

University of Wollongong.</ref><ref>Dommen, E., 1985. States, Microstates and Islands, Routledge Kegan & Paul.</ref> While employing simple quantitative criteria may seem straightforward, it can also be perceived as potentially problematic. According to some scholars the quantitative approach to defining microstates suffers from such problems as "inconsistency, arbitrariness, vagueness and inability to meaningfully isolate qualitatively distinct political units".<ref name=":1" />

Some academics have suggested defining microstates according to the unique features that are linked to their geographic or demographic smallness.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4">Neumann, I.B. & Gstöhl, S., 2004. Lilliputians in Gulliver’s World ? Small States in International Relations.</ref> Newer approaches have proposed looking at the behaviour or capacity to operate in the international arena in order to determine which states should deserve the microstate label.<ref name=":4" /><ref>Oest, K.J.N. & Wivel, A., 2010. Security, profit or shadow of the past? Explaining the security strategies of microstates. Cambridge Review of International Affairs, 23(3), pp. 429–453.</ref> Yet, it has been argued that such approaches could lead to either confusing microstates with weak states<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> (or failed states) or relying too much on subjective perceptions.<ref name=":1" />
An alternative approach, that may overcome these challenges, is to define microstates as "modern protected states".<ref name=":1" /> According to the definition proposed by Dumienski (2014): "microstates are modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints."<ref name=":1" /> Adopting this approach permits limiting the number of microstates and separating them from both small states and autonomies or dependencies.<ref name=":1" /> Examples of microstates understood as modern protected states include such states as Liechtenstein, San Marino, Monaco, Niue, Andorra, the Cook Islands or Palau.
The smallest political unit recognized as a sovereign state is Vatican City. However, Professor of International Law Maurice Mendelson disputes qualifying Vatican City as a state, arguing that it does not meet the "traditional criteria of statehood" and that the "special status of the Vatican City is probably best regarded as a means of ensuring that the Pope can freely exercise his spiritual functions, and in this respect is loosely analogous to that of the headquarters of international organisations."<ref>Mendelson, M. H. (1972). "Diminutive States in the United Nations". The International and Comparative Law Quarterly, 21(4), pp.609–630.</ref>
== Politics ==
Statistical research has shown that microstates are more likely to be Democracy than larger states. In 2012, Freedom House classified 86% of the countries with less than 500,000 inhabitants as "free".<ref name=":6">Veenendaal, W. (2015). "Democracy in microstates: why smallness does not produce a democratic political system", Democratization, 22(1): 92-112.</ref> This shows that countries with small populations often had a high degree of political freedom and civil liberties, which is one of the hallmarks of democracies. Some scholars have taken the statistical correlation between small size and democracy as a sign that smallness is beneficial to the development of a democratic political system,<ref name=":7">Anckar, D. (2004). "Regime Choices in Microstates: The Cultural Constraint", Commonwealth & Comparative Politics, 42(2): 206-223.</ref> mentioning Group cohesiveness, opportunities for direct communication and homogeneity of interests as possible explanations for why this is the case.<ref name=":6" /><ref>Corbett, J. (2015). ""Everybody knows everybody": practising politics in the Pacific Islands", Democratization, 22(1): 51-72.</ref> 
Case study research, however, has led researches to believe that the statistical evidence belies the anti-democratic elements of microstate politics.<ref name=":6" /><ref>Erk, J. and Veenendaal, W. (2014). "Is Small Really Beautiful? The Microstate Mistake", Journal of Democracy, 25(3): 135-148.</ref> Due to small populations, family and personal relations are often decisive in microstate politics. In some cases, this impedes neutral and formal decision-making and instead leads to undemocratic political activity, such as clientelism, corruption, particularism and executive dominance.<ref name=":6" /> While microstates often have formal institutions that are associated with democracy, the inner workings of politics in microstates are in reality often undemocratic.
The high number of democracies amongst microstates could be explained by their colonial history.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":7" /> Most microstates adopted the same political system as their colonial ruler.<ref name=":8">Anckar, D. (2008). "Microstate Democracy: Majority or Consensus; Diffusion or Problem-Solving?", Democratization, 15(1): 67-85.</ref> Because of the high number of microstates that were British colonies in the past, microstates often have a majoritarian and parliamentary political system similar to the Westminster system.<ref name=":7" /> Some microstates with a history as British colony have implemented some aspects of a consensus political system, to adapt to their geographic features or societal make-up.<ref name=":8" /> While the colonial history often determines what political systems microstates have, they do implement changes to better accommodate their specific characteristics.
=== Microstates and international relations ===
Microstates often rely on other countries in order to survive, as they have a small military capacity and a lack of resources. This had led some researchers to believe that microstates are forced to subordinate themselves to larger states which reduces their sovereignty.<ref name=":9">Sharman, J.C. (2017). "Sovereignty at the Extremes: Micro-States in World Politics", Political Studies, 65(3): 559-575.</ref> Research, however, has shown that microstates strategically engage in Clientelism with other countries.<ref>Veenendaal, W. (2017). "Analyzing the Foreign Policy of Microstates: The Relevance of the International Patron-Client Model", Foreign Policy Analysis, 13(3): 561-577.</ref> This allows them to trade some privileges to countries that can advance their interests the most. Examples of this are microstates that establish a tax haven or sell their support in international committees in exchange for military and economic support.<ref name=":9" />
== Historical anomalies and aspirant states ==
A small number of tiny sovereign political units are founded on historical anomalies or eccentric interpretations of law. These types of states, often labelled as "microstates," are usually located on small (usually disputed) territorial enclaves, generate limited economic activity founded on tourism and philatelic and numismatic sales, and are tolerated or ignored by the nations from which they claim to have seceded.
One example is the Republic of Indian Stream, now the town of Pittsburg, New Hampshire—a geographic anomaly left unresolved by the Treaty of Paris that ended the U.S. Revolutionary War, and claimed by both the U.S. and Canada. Between 1832 and 1835, the area's residents refused to acknowledge either claimant.
Another example is the Cospaia Republic, which became independent through a treaty error and survived from 1440 to 1826. Its independence made it important in the introduction of tobacco cultivation to Italy.
Another is Couto Misto, disputed by Spain and Portugal, that operated as a sovereign state in its own right until the 1864 Treaty of Lisbon that partitioned the territory, with the largest part becoming part of Spain.
Another is Jaxa, a small state that existed during the 17th century at the border between Tsardom of Russia and Qing China. The language commonly used in the state was Polish.

A microstate or ministate is a sovereign state having a very small population or very small land area, usually both. The meanings of "state" and "very small" are not well-defined in international law.<ref name=":0">Warrington, E. (1994). "Lilliputs Revisited". Asian Journal of Public Administration, 16(1).</ref> Recent attempts, since 2010, to define microstates have focused on identifying political entities with unique qualitative features linked to their geographic or demographic limitations. According to a qualitative definition, microstates are "modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints."<ref name=":1"></ref> In line with this and most other definitions, examples of microstates include Andorra, the Federated States of Micronesia, Liechtenstein, the Marshall Islands, Monaco, Palau, and San Marino. The smallest political entity recognized as a sovereign state is Vatican City, with around 1,000 citizens as of 2017 and an area of only . Some microstates are City-state consisting of a single municipality. 
Microstates are distinct from micronations, which are not recognized as sovereign states. Special territories without full sovereignty, such as the Crown dependencies, the special administrative regions of China, and the overseas territories of Australia, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela, are also not usually considered microstates.
