Bishopthorpe

==History==
The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book and referred to as Torp/Thorpe or Badetorps depending on which translation is used.<ref></ref><ref></ref> It came to be known as Thorp-super-Usam or Thorpe-on-Ouse in 1194.<ref></ref> By 1275 the Earliest written record of the name Bishopthorpe, spelt '"Biscupthorpe"' appears in documents. In 1202, Prior and monks of St. Andrews at Fishergate, built the first church here and dedicated it to their patron saint. The name Thorp-super-Usam therefore gradually superseded by Andrewthorpe or Thorpe St. Andrew. In 1226, Archbishop Walter de Gray bought property which once belonged to the Abbot of Kirkstall Abbey and the Priory of St. Andrews. By the year 1241, Archbishop Gray had built a Manor House and Chapel by the river. He conveyed this property to the Dean and Chapter of York thus ensuring that it remained with successive Archbishops and did not fall into the king's hands during a vacancy.
In 1405, Archbishop Scrope was accused of being a traitor by Henry IV and was beheaded in a field near the nunnery of St Clements, now Clementhorpe. In 1763, Robert Hay Drummond transformed the Palace by building the now familiar 'Strawberry Gothick' west front and gatehouse. Controversy surrounding the 1832 Reform Bill saw rioters from York attempt to invade Palace angered by initial lack of support from Archbishop Harcourt.
Bishopthorpe was the site, in 1323, of great council to agree a truce between Edward II and Robert the Bruce, whose forces had been harrying Yorkshire following the Battle of Bannockburn.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
The 1757 Enclosure act saw Common land enclosed thus placing strictures on where local people could graze their animals and affected Bishopthorpe.
In 1763, a school was founded by local yeoman, Charles Crosby and supported by the parish. The twenty boys and girls were taught to read and write and "instructed in the principles of the Christian religion." In 1846, Archbishop Harcourt built a new village school. The former school, built in 1763 and situated in School Lane, was used as a girls' school and a house for the master, but was divided into three houses in the 1890s.<ref name="Infant School"></ref>
The main line of the North Eastern Railway was being constructed in 1871 and cut through the west end of the parish running east of Bridge Road.
In 1894, Bishorpthorpe became part of the Bishopthorpe Rural District, a rural district which was abolished in 1937 by a County Review Order. In 1895, Bishopthorpe Parish Council<ref></ref> was formed.
The War Memorial<ref></ref> was erected in 1921 to parish men who made the supreme sacrifice during the First World War.
The Almshouses, built in 1846 by the Archbishop of York Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt, were demolished in 1963 due to their deterioration and the need to widen the increasingly busy junction at Sim Balk Lane and Main Street.<ref name="Almshouses"></ref>

There are three pubs. The Ebor Inn (previously known as the Brown Cow) takes its name from Eboracum, the Roman name for York. The other two are The Marcia (previously known as The Grey Mare) and The Woodman. There is also the Bishopthorpe Sports and Social Club.<ref></ref> Between 1949 and 1966, the club hosted the York Model Engineers who installed an open air ride on miniature railway in the grounds.<ref></ref>
In 1969, Vernon House, the specially built community centre for Bishopthorpe's elderly people, was officially opened. It provided a place of rest and recreation, and a kitchen and laundry. It was erected at a cost of £7,000 by Tadcaster Rural District Council to complement the area of sheltered accommodation in the village built two years earlier in Maple Avenue and Vernon Close.
In 1968, Bishopthorpe Library opened. The former library was held in the air raid shelter which was built on the same site in the Second World War. The site was formerly the village green where fairs were held for the annual two-day Trinity Feast in June.
In 1904, the Reading Room funded by Archbishop Maclagan was built as a place of rest and recreation for local men, but without the sale of alcohol. A trust was set up whereby a committee administered the building. In 1947 gas fire heaters (replacing the old open coal fires) were installed and in 1949 further works started that saw a proper stage installed and other internal renovations. It was used by cubs and brownies and other uses included jumble sales and dances, activities that now take place in St Andrew's Hall.<ref name="Reading Room"></ref> The Bishopthorpe Women's Institute was formed in 1919 and used it as their base. It was re-furbished in 1950 and was renamed St Andrew's Hall becoming known as the Village Hall.
There are 35 plots on the Parish Council run allotments on Acaster Lane<ref></ref> and a further 20 privately run plots at Glebe Farm on Moor Lane.

Additional scenes and music were added for the next production in 1930. Further productions were held in 1954, 1956, 1965 and 1970.<ref name="Bishopthorpe Play"></ref>
