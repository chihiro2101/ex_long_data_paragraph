Lady Bird Lake

==History==
The City of Austin constructed Longhorn Dam in 1960 to form Town Lake. The city needed the reservoir to serve as a cooling pond for the Holly Street Power Plant, which operated from 1960 until 2007.<ref></ref>
Before 1971, the shoreline of Town Lake was mostly a mixture of weeds, unkempt bushes, and trash.<ref name=ktbc></ref> Local television station KTBC referred to the lake as an "eyesore".<ref name=ktbc/> Some concerned Austinites led small projects to clean up the lake. Roberta Crenshaw, chair of the Austin Board of Parks and Recreation, purchased nearly 400 trees and shrubs in an effort to spearhead parkland development around the lake.<ref></ref> During his two terms in office (1971–75), the Mayor of Austin Roy Butler led the Austin City Council to establish the Town Lake Beautification Committee, and he appointed Lady Bird Johnson as the project's honorary chairman. Johnson's involvement brought attention and money (including $19,000 of her own) to the Town Lake project, allowing for the planting of hundreds of shrubs and trees.<ref>Wear, Ben. "Lady Bird helped turn Town Lake into town treasure". Austin American-Statesman, July 13, 2007. pA1, A6.</ref> The city also built a system of hike and bike trails along the shoreline of the lake.
On July 26, 2007, the Austin City Council passed a controversial resolution authorizing the renaming of the reservoir from Town Lake to Lady Bird Lake in honor of Lady Bird Johnson, who had died earlier that month.<ref name="chron_20070726">Raskin, Amy (2007). urltoken "Austin changes Town Lake name to Lady Bird Lake". Houston Chronicle. July 26, 2007.</ref> Johnson had declined the honor of having the lake renamed for her while she was alive. In renaming the lake, the City Council recognized Johnson's dedication to beautifying the lake and her efforts to create a recreational trail system around the lake's shoreline.<ref name="wilson">Wilson, Janet (2007). urltoken "Lady Bird Johnson dies at 94" . Austin American-Statesman. July 12, 2007.</ref>
In 2009, non-profit organization urltoken Keep Austin Beautiful launched "Clean Lady Bird Lake".<ref></ref> The program mobilizes thousands of community volunteers annually to conduct large-scale cleanups along the lake every other month and targeted cleanups throughout the year.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
==Recreational uses==
Lady Bird Lake is a major recreation area for the City of Austin. The lake's banks are bounded by the Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail, and businesses offer recreational watercraft services along the lakefront portion of the trail. Austin's largest downtown park, Zilker Park, is adjacent to the lake, and Barton Springs, a major attraction for swimmers, flows into the lake.
The City of Austin prohibits the operation of most motorized watercraft on Lady Bird Lake.<ref name="ellis">Ellis, Luke (2006). urltoken "The Common Law: Boating on Town Lake – What's the Law?" March 17, 2006.</ref> As a result, the lake serves as a popular recreational area for paddleboards, kayaks, canoes, dragon boats, and rowing shells. Austin's warm climate and the river's calm waters, nearly length and straight courses are especially popular with crew teams and clubs. Along with the University of Texas women's rowing team and coeducational club rowing team, who practice on Lady Bird Lake year-round, teams from other universities (including the University of Wisconsin,<ref> urltoken the University of Chicago, the University of Oklahoma, and the University of Nebraska) train on Lady Bird Lake during Christmas holidays and Spring Break. 
Other water sports along the shores of the lake include swimming in Deep Eddy Pool, the oldest swimming pool in Texas, and Barton Springs Pool, a natural pool on Barton Creek which flows into Lady Bird Lake. Below Tom Miller Dam is Red Bud Isle, a small island formed by the 1900 Austin Dam failure (Texas) that serves as a recreation area with a dog park and access to the lake for canoeing and fishing.<ref name="redbud"> urltoken "Austin Parks and Recreation Department, Red Bud Isle" </ref>
Swimming in Lady Bird Lake is illegal not due to poor water quality from the run-off from area streets, which is a false rumor, but rather due to several drownings as well as debris in the water from bridges and dams destroyed by floods in years past. The City of Austin enacted the ban in 1964, and the fine can be up to $500.<ref></ref>
Music venues on the banks of Lady Bird Lake are home to a number of events year-round, including the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the fall, the Austin Reggae Festival and Spamarama in the spring, and many open-air concerts at Auditorium Shores on the south bank and Fiesta Gardens on the north bank. The Austin Aqua Festival was held on the shores of Lady Bird Lake from 1962 until 1998. The late Austin resident and Slide guitar legend, Stevie Ray Vaughan played a number of concerts at Auditorium Shores and is honored with a memorial statue on the south bank.
===Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail===
The Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail, formerly the Town Lake Hike and Bike Trail, creates a complete circuit around Lady Bird Lake. It is one of the oldest urban Texas hike and bike paths. The trail is the longest trail designed for non-motorized traffic maintained by the Austin, Texas Parks and Recreation Department. A local nonprofit, urltoken The Trail Foundation, is the Trail's private steward and has made urltoken Trail-wide improvements by adding user amenities and infrastructure including trailheads and lakefront gathering areas, locally-designed jewel box restrooms, exercise equipment, as well as doing trailwide ecological restoration work on an ongoing basis. The Butler Trail loop was completed in 2014 with the public-private partnership 1-mile urltoken Boardwalk project, which was spearheaded by The Trail Foundation.<ref></ref>
The trail is long and mostly flat, with 97.5% of it at less than an 8% grade. The trail's surface is smooth and is mostly crushed granite except for a few lengths of concrete and a boardwalk<ref></ref> on the South-side of the lake. A pedestrian bridge incorporated into the trail bridges Barton Creek. The Roberta Crenshaw Pedestrian Walkway spans Lady Bird Lake beneath MoPac Boulevard and provides the trail's westernmost crossing of Lady Bird Lake.
===Fishing===
Lady Bird Lake has been stocked with several species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. The predominant fish species in Lady Bird Lake are largemouth bass, catfish, carp, and sunfish. Fishing is regulated, requiring a fishing license, and daily bag and length limits apply for most species.
A ban on the consumption of fish caught in the lake was issued by the City of Austin in 1990, as a result of excessively high levels of chlordane found in the fish.<ref name="ban">Texas Environmental Almanac . urltoken "Water Quality". Texas Environmental Almanac. ch. 2, p. 6.</ref> Although the use of chlordane as a pesticide was banned in the United States in 1988, the chemical sticks strongly to soil particles and can continue to pollute groundwater for years after its application. The ban on the consumption of fish caught in the lake was finally lifted in 1999.<ref name="lifted">Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission (1999). urltoken "Regulations Committee Meeting".

==Drinking water uses==
The first water treatment facility in the City of Austin, the Thomas C. Green Water Treatment Plant, was built in 1925 to treat water from the Colorado River. The plant occupied just west of the principal downtown business district. The water treatment facility was decommissioned in late 2008.<ref name="green">City of Austin (2008). urltoken "Green Water Treatment Plant Decommissioning Ceremony Tuesday". Press Release.

Lady Bird Lake (formerly, and still colloquially referred to as Town Lake) is a river-like reservoir on the Colorado River in Austin, Texas, United States. The City of Austin created the reservoir in 1960 as a cooling pond for a new city power plant. The lake, which has a surface area of , is now used primarily for recreation and flood control. The reservoir is named in honor of former First Lady of the United States Lady Bird Johnson.<ref name="Lady Bird Lake"></ref>
Lady Bird Lake is the easternmost lake of a chain of reservoirs on the river, which is completely located in Texas, and should not be confused with the larger Colorado River located in the Southwestern United States. This chain, known locally as the Texas Highland Lakes, also includes Lake Buchanan, Inks Lake, Lake LBJ, Lake Marble Falls, Lake Travis, and Lake Austin.
