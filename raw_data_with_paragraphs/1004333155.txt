Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway

==Background and education==
Mette-Marit Tjessem Høiby was born in Kristiansand in the southern part of Norway, the daughter of Sven O. Høiby, who had been unemployed for some time but who had previously worked as a journalist for a local paper, and Marit Tjessem, a former bank clerk. Her parents divorced, and her father later married professional stripper Renate Barsgård.<ref></ref> She has a sister and two older brothers, including Per Høiby, chief executive of the PR agency First House. Her stepbrother, Trond Berntsen by her mother's 1994 marriage to Rolf Berntsen died in the 2011 Norway attacks. Mette-Marit grew up in Kristiansand, spending many weekends and holidays in the nearby valley of Setesdal and on the coast, where she learned to sail. During her youth, she was active in the local Slettheia youth club, where she was also an activity leader. As a teenager, she played volleyball, qualifying as a referee and coach.
After starting at Oddernes upper secondary school in Kristiansand, Mette-Marit spent six months at Wangaratta High School located in North East Victoria in Australia as an exchange student with the exchange organisation, Youth For Understanding. Later, she attended Kristiansand katedralskole, where she passed her final examinations in 1994. She then spent several months working for the Norwegian-British Chamber of Commerce<ref></ref> at Norway House in Cockspur Street, London. When her assignment in London ended, Mette-Marit relocated to Norway.
By her own admission, Mette-Marit experienced a rebellious phase before she met Crown Prince Haakon Magnus.<ref></ref> As a part-time student, she took six years, longer than usual, to complete her high school education before going on to take preparatory college courses at Agder College. She then worked on and off as a waitress at the restaurant Engebret Cafè in Oslo.<ref></ref>
In the late 1990s, Mette-Marit attended the Quart festival, Norway's largest music festival, in her hometown of Kristiansand. She met Crown Prince Haakon at a garden party during the Quart Festival season.<ref name=fvn2006></ref> Years later, after becoming a single mother she met the prince again at another party related to the festival.<ref name=fvn2006 />
Since becoming crown princess, Mette-Marit has taken several university-level courses. In 2012, she obtained a master's degree in Executive Management.<ref></ref> Most of her ancestors were cotters and small farmers.<ref></ref>
==Engagement and marriage==
When the engagement between Crown Prince Haakon and Mette-Marit was announced, public and media reaction was negative, with many Norwegians being "horrified"<ref></ref> and feeling that the Crown Prince's choice of partner was questionable; her lack of education, previous relationships with convicted felons and her socialization in a milieu "where drugs were readily available" were often cited by critics.<ref></ref> At the time of their engagement, Mette-Marit was a single mother to a son named Marius Borg Høiby, born 13 January 1997 from her relationship with convicted felon<ref> urltoken Marius' far var ikke med, BT</ref> Morten Borg. Her son caused a possible security risk in 2012 to the royal family by posting photos of the family's whereabouts on the Internet.<ref name="Security Scandal"></ref> Mette-Marit is reported to be a social media user and it has been rumoured that the royal family may not follow the instruction to refrain from revealing personal information on social media.<ref name="Security Scandal"/> Marius Borg Høiby, who holds no title or special role, withdrew from public life in 2017 when he moved to the United States to attend an unspecified college.<ref></ref> In 2018 it became known that he had falsely used the title "prince" when working as an intern abroad, despite not holding any such title.<ref></ref>
Her first official appearance as the intended bride of the Crown Prince was at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony at Oslo City Hall on 10 December 2000, following the announcement of the couple's engagement on 1 December. At the press conference, Haakon said that he and Mette-Marit had been together for about one year. Haakon gave Mette-Marit the same engagement ring that his grandfather King Olav V and his father King Harald V had given to their fiancées.
The couple married on 25 August 2001 at the Oslo Cathedral. Upon her marriage, she acquired the title, Her Royal Highness the Crown Princess of Norway.<ref></ref> They now live outside Oslo at Skaugum estate.
The couple has two children together: Princess Ingrid Alexandra, born 21 January 2004 and Prince Sverre Magnus, born 3 December 2005.
==Public life and further education==
During 2002 and 2003, the Crown Princess undertook development studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, apparently without graduating. She was also accepted as an intern at NORAD, the Norwegian government's development organization. Mette-Marit attended lectures at the faculties of arts and social sciences at the University of Oslo, but did not graduate.<ref name="Crown Princess Mette-Marit"></ref>

===Controversies===
