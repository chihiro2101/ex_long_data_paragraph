== History ==
Around 40,000 years ago Devonport consisted of three islands of volcanic origin, Mount Victoria, North Head and between them Mount Cambria (now largely quarried away).<ref name=devonporttours1> urltoken About Devonport 1 (from the devonpporttours.co.nz website)</ref>
The earliest evidence for Māori settlement dates from the mid-14th century (roughly the same time as the believed landing of the Tainui migration canoe, which is commemorated by a stone memorial on the foreshore).<ref name="TRAVEL">Set sail for adventure on dry land – The New Zealand Herald, Travel: NZ Special Issue, Tuesday 6 November 2007, Page D7</ref> A significant Māori settlement on North Head was ended by attacks from rival tribes in the 1790s.<ref name=devonporttours2> urltoken About Devonport 2 (from the devonpporttours.co.nz website)</ref> About 50 Māori were still living in Torpedo Bay, with their meeting house just east of Cambridge Terrace, until they fled to the Waikato when the Invasion of the Waikato in 1863.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
Jules Dumont d'Urville, a French explorer, is thought to have gone ashore in the area in 1827, possibly as the first European.<ref name="TRAVEL"/> The first European building on the foreshore was a gunpowder magazine built in 1840.<ref name=NSHeritage131></ref>
Devonport is one of the oldest colonial settlements in Auckland, and the first on the North Shore. In 1841 a signal station for Auckland's shipping was erected on Mount Victoria (Auckland), and the signal master, Robert Snow, and his family became the first Europeans to live in the area permanently.<ref name=NSHeritage131/> From then until the 1860s, the settlement was called Flagstaff, because of the flagstaff at the signal station.<ref name=NSHeritage141></ref> Flagstaff was subdivided for town sections and farms in the early 1850s.<ref name=NSHeritage131/>
For the first half century or so of its existence Devonport was geographically isolated from the rest of the North Shore, and was sometimes called "the island" by the local inhabitants.<ref name=fullers> urltoken Destination History – Devonport (from the Fullers Ferries website. Retrieved 2007-09-14.)</ref> Only a thin strip of land beside the beach at Narrow Neck connected Devonport to Belmont and the rest of the North Shore peninsula. In the late 19th century the mangrove swamp that stretched from Narrow Neck to Ngataringa Bay was filled in to form a racecourse, now a golf course.<ref name=fullers /> A new road was built along the western edge of the racecourse allowing more direct travel to the north.
On the southern shore, to the west of the centre of Devonport, a nearby deep water anchorage suitable for Royal Navy vessels, the Devonport Naval Base was established. William Hobson, then the Governor of New Zealand, considered the sandspit-protected area a better choice for a naval installation than the shallower Tamaki waters on the southern side of the harbour.<ref name="TRAVEL"/> While some facilities have expanded and shifted in location over time, the area is still the primary base for the Royal New Zealand Navy. The Calliope Dock at Stanley Bay, part of the base, was opened on 16 February 1888 and at the time was the largest dock in the Southern hemisphere. The suburb also had one of the oldest New Zealand shipyards, now part of the Devonport Yacht Club area.<ref name="TRAVEL"/>
The main centre of the suburb slowly shifted west from Church Street and the original wharf at Torpedo Bay, to its current location around the ferry wharf.<ref name="TRAVEL"/> The settlement itself was renamed Devonport by 1859 after the English naval town of Devonport.<ref>Wises New Zealand Guide, 7th Edition, 1979. Page 83</ref> Devonport achieved Borough status in 1886 and was incorporated into North Shore City in 1989.
Devonport played a special role in the nuclear free movement. In 1981 the Devonport Borough Council voted to declare Devonport a nuclear-free zone, the first local council in New Zealand to do so.<ref></ref>Image:Devonport auckland.jpg|right|thumb|Devonport as seen from Mt Victoria.

In July 2007, Devonport was given permission to be excluded from a list of local Auckland growth node centres. The Auckland Regional Council accepted that while it was encouraging intensified growth (such as higher-density housing) around transport nodes such as Devonport, the character and historical nature of the Devonport Wharf area would make such a designation inappropriate in this case.<ref> urltoken Development gets thumbs down – The New Zealand Herald, Tuesday 17 July 2007, Page A9</ref>
In 2011 the Devonport community, led by parents and local publication the Devonport Flagstaff, launched a grassroots movement protesting the sale of the synthetic cannabis Kronic in local dairies. The battle was a success, and Kronic was banned from the area.<ref> urltoken 
=== Ferries ===
The first ferry services to Auckland city began in the 1840s. These were open sailing cutters operated by local seamen running passengers to the foot of Queen Street, Auckland's main road. In 1860 the first paddlesteamer ferries began operation.<ref name="devonporttours1" /><ref name="fullers" />
These were in turn replaced by double-ended, screw-driven ferries in 1904.<ref name="fullers" /> Both passenger and vehicle ferries operated on the Devonport run until the opening of the Auckland Harbour Bridge in 1959. Immediately after the opening of the bridge, passenger ferry services to other North Shore destinations (such as Northcote and Birkenhead) were cancelled, as were all vehicular ferries. The Devonport passenger ferry was retained on a much reduced timetable. The majority of the ferries were scrapped, only a handful being retained until being replaced by more modern vessels. The last of the old-style double-ended ferries, the diesel-engined Kestrel (built in 1905), was retired from the commuter run in 1988 and was then operated for cruises and sightseeing.
In 2002 the Kestrel was moved to Tauranga to serve as a floating restaurant. The Kestrel changed hands again in 2010 and moved back to Auckland.<ref></ref> On 8 March 2016 the Kestrel broke up and sank while tethered in its Wynyard Quarter berth.<ref></ref> She was refloated, but her future remains uncertain.<ref></ref>
== Local government ==
Devonport had a local government just like other suburbs in Auckland at that time. The local government was called Devonport Borough Council, which started in 1886 and merged into North Shore City Council and then eventually amalgamated into Auckland Council.

==Landmarks ==
Between the wharf and Mt Victoria are the Devonport shops; located here are a number of interesting landmarks:
* The Esplanade Hotel – this is an elegant example of an 1890s seaside hotel, reminiscent of many an English seaside resort of the period. A modern extension was added on in the 1950s which has now been replaced by an apartment complex. The Edwardian building was sold for $7 million in 2015.<ref></ref>
* Windsor Reserve – located just to the east of the Devonport Wharf; it is an area of open lawn notable for the 1980s toilet block and the Edwardian archway at the northern end.
* King Edward Parade Reserve – to the north of the Windsor Reserve on the other side of the road is the King Edward Parade Reserve; here are located the Public Library, the War Memorial (a bronze soldier figure by Richard Gross) and under the Moreton Bay Fig trees a charming 1950s styled bandstand.
* The former Post Office – an Art Deco gem from the 1930s.
* The Left Bank – a 1920s neoclassical building now housing a cafe/bar/restaurant.
* The Victoria Cinema – built in 1912 and remodelled internally and externally in the 1930s in the then fashionable Art Deco style; this is apparently the oldest cinema in the Southern Hemisphere in continuous use. The cinema was purchased for $1.55 million in 2006 by the North Shore City Council on behalf of the city.<ref></ref>
==Devonport Wharf==
Today, ferry services to Devonport Wharf are more numerous again, and are subsidised by Auckland Transport, . A crossing between the Auckland CBD and Devonport takes about 12 minutes, usually on the 'Seabus Kea', a newer double-ended ferry.<ref name=fullers />
The Devonport Wharf / Ferry Terminal received a variety of maintenance and repairs during 2011 in advance of the Rugby World Cup. Further structural works were carried out in 2012.<ref></ref>
In 2015 a $24 million redevelopment project to upgrade parts of Devonport including the wharf began.
