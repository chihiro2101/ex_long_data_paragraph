== Staffing ==
As at 31 December 2018, there are 37,505 people employed from more than 140 countries within the Secretariat.<ref></ref> 
Eligibility for civil service is based on a UN-administered examination offered worldwide, in addition to a competitive application process.<ref name=Secretariat></ref> Qualifications for membership include "the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity",<ref name="Charter of the United Nations"></ref> according to the UN Charter. Staff-members are appointed by the Secretary-General alone and are assigned to the organs of the United Nations. Staff members are appointed on a temporary or permanent basis, under the discretion of the Secretary-General.<ref></ref> During staff recruitment, geographical variety is an especially prominent selection factor in order to accurately reflect the scope of member states present in the UN.<ref name="The UN Charter"></ref> The charter states that staff members are responsible "only to the organization" and are prohibited from any action or influence that would suggest affiliation with a government or organization outside the UN.<ref name="The UN Charter"/>
Headquartered in New York, the Secretariat functions through duty stations in Addis Ababa, Bangkok, Beirut, Geneva, Nairobi, Santiago and Vienna, in addition to offices all over the world.<ref name="Secretariat"/>
One study finds the following factors play a role in the selection of staff for the Secretariat: a desire to achieve a minimum number of officials from each state; population size; and lo assessment of dues. The most overrepresented states in the Secretariat are small, rich democracies. The Nordic states stand out, in particular, when it comes to overrepresentation.<ref></ref>
== Status of Women in the Secretariat==
Representation of women in the United Nations (UN), particularly at managerial and decision-making positions at the D-1 level and above, has been a United Nations General Assembly concern and goal since 1970.
<ref name="women, 15 December 1970"></ref><ref name="A/RES/45/239"></ref> Since 1984, the UN Secretariat, in order to achieve early Gender Equality, issued several five-year "Action Plans", including Strategic Plans, to improve the status of women in the Secretariat.<ref name="A/RES/45/239"/><ref name="40/258. 18 December 1985"></ref> These plans, however, did not have the desired impact, and progress in achieving gender parity remained slow.
In December 1994, the UN General Assembly's "disappointment" that its Gender Equality target were not met urged the Secretary General to prioritize the recruitment and promotion of women to reach to 50/50 representation in D1 and above posts by 2000.<ref name="ST/SGB/282"></ref><ref name="A/RES/49/167 - 23/dec"></ref> In Feb 2004, gender Parity target for the secretariat was once again revised to 2015.<ref></ref><ref name="UN women legislative basis"></ref> In 2009, despite the plans, and GA resolutions, the representation of women in the UN Secretariat remained well below parity at 29.2 percent.<ref name="A /65/334"></ref> 
===Representation of Women at Decision making levels ===
The representation of women in the UN secretariat, at the D1 level, in 2000, was 30.3 percent. Instead of increasing, in the next decade, the representation of women in the secretariat decreased to 26.7 percent<ref name="A /65/334" />In December 2011, the representation of women in the Secretariat at the D1 level was 27.4 percent, an increase of .6 percent over a two-year period.<ref name="A /67/347"></ref> At the current rate of progress, it is estimated that gender parity at the D-1 to higher levels will be achieved after 102 years.<ref name="A /67/347" /> At D2 level The representation of women in 2011 was 24.4 percent<ref name="A /67/347"/> 
===Special Measures for the Achievement of Gender Equality===
To ensure that the Gender Equality target mandated by the General Assembly is met, the Secretariat, in September 1999, promulgated Administrative Instruction(AI) on "Special Measures for the Achievement of Gender Equality"( ST/AI/1999/9 )<ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1"></ref> Gender Equality A/I echoes the goals of, and is in conformity with, mandate of Articles 8 and 101 of the Charter of the United Nations, and Article 4 paragraph 1 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).<ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1" /><ref name="United Nations"></ref>
On 4 September 2012, in his Annual Reports to the General Assembly, titled "Improvement of the status of women in the United Nations system", Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated that the aim of Special Measures was to ensure "gender balance in recruitment and promotion".<ref name="A /67/347" /> and that Special measures would remain in effect until the "goal of gender parity is achieved", and sustained for a period of time.<ref name="A /67/347"/><ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1" />"<ref name="A /67/347"/> The Secretary General in his Recommendations to the GA noted that the " United Nations Secretariat, pursuant to the decision of the Policy Committee chaired by the Secretary-General" is to "ensure the effective implementation of special measures for gender equality. These measures include mandatory selection of equally or better-qualified women candidates…"<ref name="A /67/347" />
== Reforms ==
Since its creation, the Secretariat has undergone extensive reforms. On 21 March 2005, Secretary-General Kofi Annan proposed several reforms for the Secretariat. He announced his intentions to appoint a Scientific Adviser, create a peacebuilding support office, establish a cabinet-style decision-making mechanism, and strengthen the mediation function. He also asked the General Assembly to appropriate funds for a one-time staff buyout; to work with him in revising budgetary and human resources rules; to grant the Secretary-General more managerial authority and flexibility; to strengthen the Office of Internal Oversight Services; and "to review all mandates older than five years to see whether the activities concerned are still genuinely needed or whether the resources assigned to them can be reallocated in response to new and emerging challenges".<ref> urltoken V. Strengthening the United Nations In Larger Freedom, United Nations</ref>

The United Nations Secretariat is one of the six major organs of the United Nations, with the others being (a) the General Assembly; (b) the Security Council; (c) the Economic and Social Council; (d) the defunct Trusteeship Council; and (e) the International Court of Justice.<ref name="Organs of the UN"></ref><ref name="UN Secretariat"></ref> The Secretariat is the United Nations' executive arm. The Secretariat has an important role in setting the agenda for the deliberative and decision-making bodies of the UN (the General Assembly, Economic and Social Council, and Security Council), and the implementation of the decision of these bodies. The Secretary-General, who is appointed by the General Assembly, is the head of the secretariat.<ref name="UN Secretariat"/>
The mandate of the secretariat is a wide one. Dag Hammarskjöld, the United Nations' second Secretary-General, described its power as follows: "The United Nations is what member nations made it, but within the limits set by government action and government cooperation, much depends on what the Secretariat makes it. it has creative capacity. It can introduce new ideas. It can, in proper forms, take initiatives. It can put before member governments findings which will influence their actions".<ref name="Hammarskjöld1968"></ref> The United Nations Department of Political Affairs, which has a role analogous to a ministry of foreign affairs, is a part of the secretariat. So is the Department of Peace Operations. The secretariat is the main source of economic and political analysis for the General Assembly and Security Council; it administers operations initiated by UN's deliberative organs, operates political missions, prepares assessments that precede peacekeeping operations, appoints the heads of peacekeeping operations, conducts surveys and research, communicates with non-state actors such as media and non-government organizations, and is responsible for publishing all of the treaties and international agreements.<ref name="UN Secretariat"/><ref name="Paul Novosad"></ref><ref>United Nations.
