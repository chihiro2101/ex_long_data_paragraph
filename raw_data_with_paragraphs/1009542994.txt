Fleet, Hampshire

==History==
The site of Fleet was originally heathland in the northern part of the Crondall Hundred. The name Fleet was probably derived from the Norman French word La Flete meaning a stream or shallow water - a reference to the Fleet Pond from which fish had been taken for the monks in Winchester in Medieval times.<ref name=Roe></ref>
=== Early Days (to 1904) ===
This north-east corner of Hampshire had shallow and sandy, slightly acidic soil, much of it boggy or covered in gorse and bracken (see Bagshot Formation). It held little use for agriculture compared to the long-grazed chalk lands and belts of alluvial areas of the rest of the county. The Fleet area has yielded few archaeological finds.<ref></ref>
Isaac Taylor's Map of Hampshire (1759) shows three small habitations in the area that was later to become Fleet.<ref name=Roe/>
In 1792 the Basingstoke Canal opened. The canal passed through the town site, but apart from a few inns to serve the passing trade it had little effect on the locality. Apart from the Farnham to Reading road, the site remained largely undeveloped until the construction of the London and South Western Railway, which opened in 1840. In that year a church - Christ Church that was to become the heart of the new ecclesiastical parish of Ewshot and Crookham was built midway between the villages of Crookham and Ewshot. This parish included the area that was to become the town of Fleet. The railway company promoted Fleet Pond for a destination for day excursions and many people came down from London to skate on the Pond during the winter. This attracted a number of gentry, particularly retired army officers, who moved to the area bounded by Fleet Road, Elvetham Road and Reading Road North<ref> urltoken Hart District Council & Atkins Ltd - Fleet Town Centre Urban Design Framework - Fleet Town Centre Analysis Report November 2006</ref> and laid the foundations of what was to become known locally as "The Blue Triangle".<ref></ref>
By 1860 Charles Lefroy, a local squire, commissioned All Saints' Church â€“ in the Blue Triangle area in memory of his wife who had died in 1857. The architect was William Burges. The ecclesiastical parish of Ewshot and Crookam was split into two in 1862, with the northern section based on the All Saints' church becoming the new parish of Fleet. On 22 June 2015 the roof of All Saints' church was destroyed by fire following an arson attack.<ref></ref>
The development of Fleet accelerated when the land to the south east of the Blue Triangle was sold for development in 1882. Development on this land was laid out in a grid pattern.
=== As part of the Urban District Council (1904 - 1974) ===
Under the Local Government Act 1894 many of the duties that had previously been shouldered by the ecclesiastical parishes were transferred to new civil parish and Crookham, Fleet and Crondall each gained an elected parish council. In 1904 the civil parish of Crookham was split into two - Crookham Village and Church Crookham with Church Crookham and Fleet Rural Parish being merged to form the Fleet and Church Crookham Urban District.
As in many parts of Britain, there was a building boom between the First and Second World Wars.
=== As part of the Hart District Council (1974 onwards) ===
Fleet expanded over the decades, with new residential areas being built at Ancells Farm, Zebon Copse (Church Crookham is included in the built-up area per the Government Statistical Service) and Elvetham Heath. Completed in 2008,<ref></ref> Elvetham Heath is one of the UK's largest new housing developments and added some 3,500 inhabitants to Fleet's population, bringing its total population up to around 35,000. This represented a 20% population increase in less than a decade.
Earlier in the 1990s, two developments in Fleet involved a double opening on 10 May 1991; the Hart Shopping Centre, which was opened officially by the Duchess Of York and the old Hart Leisure Centre on Hitches Lane. The old Hart Leisure Centre was replaced by a new one on the other side of the road in 2019.<ref></ref>
Fleet had been a dormitory town for commuters to London. It now has several business parks, mainly occupied by Information Technology companies.

Areas and suburbs of Fleet town are Pondtail, Ancells Park and Elvetham Heath. The villages of Crookham Village and Church Crookham are contiguous with the town. Immediately surrounding towns and villages include Winchfield, Dogmersfield, Crondall, Ewshot, and Hartley Wintney.
The Fleet Pond nature reserve is a beauty spot on the northern edge of the town. Fleet Pond is in fact the largest freshwater lake in Hampshire. Due to being very shallow, Fleet Pond is actively managed and needs regular dredging to avoid it silting up.<ref></ref> In times past, the lake has frozen over permitting skating.
Fleet is on junction 4A of the M3 motorway. Fleet services on the M3 lies at the edge of the town.
Fleet's main road, Fleet Road, runs through the town centre from south-west to north-east. Fleet railway station is on the Waterloo to Southampton main line; the train service is run by South Western Railway. Journey time to Waterloo is about 50 minutes, express trains do the journey in under 40 minutes. Nearby airports are Blackbushe and Farnborough. The Basingstoke Canal, built at the end of the eighteenth century, connected Fleet to Basingstoke and, in the other direction, London via the Wey navigation. By the early twentieth century the canal had fallen into disrepair, but the section between the Wey Navigation and the Greywell Tunnel has since been restored by volunteers and is maintained as a leisure facility.<ref></ref>
