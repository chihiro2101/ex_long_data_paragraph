==Treasuries as government departments==
===Treasury===
In the United Kingdom, Her Majesty's Treasury is overseen by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The traditional honorary title of First Lord of the Treasury is held by the Prime Minister. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs administers the taxation system.
In the United States, the Treasurer reports to an executive-appointed Secretary of the Treasury. The IRS is the revenue agency of the US Department of the Treasury.
===Ministry of finance===
In many other countries, the treasury is called the "ministry of finance" and the head is known as the finance minister. Examples include the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Belgium, Spain, Italy, New Zealand, Ghana, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Pakistan and Zimbabwe.
===Both===
In some other countries, a "Treasury" will exist alongside a separate "Ministry of Finance", with divided functions.
The State Treasury in Polish law represents the Poland acting in the field of civil law relations in which it is treated as equal partner to private entities (as opposed to the sphere of public law relations in which the State represented by public authorities decides unilaterally on the legal situation of individuals). It can be represented by various officials or institutions depending on circumstances and has its own ministry, the Ministry of State Treasury. Historically, it was created in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland in 1590, when the public treasury (or&nbsp;the&nbsp;Crown Treasury) was split from the Royal Treasury.
The government of Ukraine also includes the Ministry of Finance as well as the Ministry of State Treasury. It was the same in Italy before the creation of the united Ministry of Economy.
In the Australian federal government a treasurer and a finance minister co-exist. The Department of the Treasury is responsible for drafting the government budget, economic policy (except monetary policy), some market regulation and revenue policy (which is administered by the Australian Taxation Office). The Finance Minister, who manages the Department of Finance and Deregulation, is responsible for budget management, government expenditure and market deregulation.
==Treasuries as locations==
A treasury is also a room or building in which precious or valuable objects are preserved,<ref> urltoken treasury at OED</ref> especially Objet d'art in precious metals and jewels, of a ruler or other collector which are kept in a secure room and often found in the basement of a palace or castle.
 
===State treasuries===
In past times revenue collected by the monarch would be kept in a secure stronghold; the kings of England traditionally used the Tower of London, which also housed the Royal Mint. Latterly gold reserves are held in a countries central bank; the gold reserves of the United Kingdom are housed in a vault at the Bank of England.<ref> urltoken Gold Reserves at bullionbypost; retrieved 2 January 2020</ref> 
The country with the largest gold reserve is the United States; the US claims to have 8133.5 tonnes of gold, held at Fort Knox (58%), West Point (20%), the US Mint in Denver (16%) and the residue (approx 5%) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.<ref> urltoken US Gold Reserves, Of Immense Interest to Russia and China at bullionstar.com; retrieved 2 January 2020</ref> 
The second largest reserve, that of Germany, is held at the Deutsche Bundesbank in Frankfurt am Main, the Federal Reserve Bank in New York and the Bank of England in London.<ref name=CLT> urltoken Transparency – at least as valuable as gold Carl-Ludwig Thiele, 14 December 2017, at gold.org; retrieved 2 January 2020 </ref>
The third, held by the IMF, is in a number of in designated deposits. 
These treasuries are believed to satisfy a number of essential criteria, which include cost efficiency, security, and the ability to liquidate reserves at short notice.<ref name=CLT/>
===Church treasuries===
The Church has Church treasure that have spiritual or religious value rather than financial worth; these are housed in treasuries at most cathedrals. These take the form of relics, icons, manuscripts, votive offerings and Vestment. Of particular note are the St Chad Gospels at Lichfield Cathedral, and the Codex Eyckensis at St Catherine's Church, Maaseik. The treasury at Aachen cathedral has a number of valuable artifacts, such as the Cross of Lothair and the Treasury Gospels.
===Private treasuries===
Collections of personal treasures, where the objects assembled are there because of the interest of the collector, rather than any intrinsic value, have been seen since the times of the Ancient Greeks, and more particularly, the Romans.<ref>D Presziosi The Art of Art History p573-4 (2009) </ref> For example, various Roman emperors devoted considerable effort to bring Egyptian obelisks from the Middle East to Rome, or had copies made in Rome itself. 
In medieval times a number of monarchs had menageries of exotic beasts; Henry III (r.1216-1292) owned three leopards, a polar bear and an African elephant, while emperor Frederick II (r.1220-1250) owned giraffes, cheetahs, lynxes, leopards, exotic birds and an elephant, and had a variety of rare falcons.
The private collection of curiosities in England has been ascribed to 16th century polymath Francis Bacon,<ref>B Arnold The Art Atlas of Britain and Ireland (1991) </ref> and in Europe to the emperor Rudolph II. In Russia this was pioneered by tsar Peter the Great.<ref>MB Piotrovski Great private Collections of Imperial Russia p15

Notable modern collections include the Waddesdon and the Wallace collections in Britain, and the Getty and Guggenheim collections in the USA.
