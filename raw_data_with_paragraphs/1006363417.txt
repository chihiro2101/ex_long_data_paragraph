Gay Byrne

==Early life==
Byrne was the son of Edward Byrne, who joined the Irish Volunteers in 1912. In 1913, Edward Byrne enlisted as a professional trooper with the British Army's 19th Royal Hussars cavalry regiment, given a background as a horseman from his father's employment by the Earl of Meath as a coachman in County Wicklow.<ref name=the_time_of_my_life_p5/> On the outbreak of World War I he was mobilized and went with his unit to the Western Front, where he took part in heavy fighting in the Ypres Salient and at the Battle of the Somme. He was discharged from the British Army at the war's end in 1919.<ref>'Gay Byrne on his father's service in World War I', 'Independent.ie' newspaper, 18 May 2014. urltoken He later took part in the Irish War of Independence.<ref name=the_time_of_my_life_p5>Byrne, The Time of My Life, p. 5</ref>
In the early 1920s, Edward Byrne was employed by Guinness' St. James's Gate Brewery, where he worked for most of the rest of his life on the barges that operated on the River Liffey, transporting wooden casks from St. James's Gate Brewery to sea ships at the North Wall in Dublin.<ref>Byrne, The Time of My Life, pp 6 – 7, & pp 11 – 12.</ref> Byrne's father, Edward, married his mother, Annie, in 1917, when briefly home on leave from the war.<ref></ref> The two had met near Bray just before the war began. Both of them were from County Wicklow. His siblings were Ray, Al, Ernest and Mary; all but Mary predeceased him.<ref></ref>
Byrne was born on 5 August 1934 and grew up in The Liberties in Dublin.<ref>Byrne, The Time of My Life, p. 18</ref><ref> (The Irish Examiner is an Irish newspaper).</ref> He first lived with his family at 17 Rialto Street, Rialto, Dublin, before his parents moved to 124 (later renumbered 512) South Circular Road, Dublin, in 1944. Byrne's mother, Annie, died in late 1964.<ref>Byrne, The Time of My Life, p. 89</ref>
Byrne attended Rialto National School (since closed) and a number of other schools for short periods. Subsequently, he was educated by the Irish Christian Brothers at Synge Street CBS.<ref name=launches_online_book_club/> He and two classmates bought a jazz record when Byrne was fourteen years old in January 1948, at a time when Radio Éireann refused to play it because of its "licentious" content.<ref name=montrose_chameleon/> In December 2009, Byrne returned to his old primary school on Synge Street to launch an online children's book club, and read an extract from Marita Conlon-McKenna's storybook In Deep Dark Wood.<ref name=launches_online_book_club></ref> In 2009, whilst celebrating the 250th anniversary of Guinness, he revealed that he had once tried unsuccessfully to earn a job in the brewery near his childhood home.<ref></ref>
When he was young, Byrne was inspired by the broadcaster Eamonn Andrews, who had a successful career on British television, and "wanted to be what he was".<ref></ref> Andrews was friendly with Byrne's eldest brother.<ref name=walking_on_air/> In 1958, he moved over to broadcasting when he became a presenter on Radio Éireann. He also worked with Granada Television and the BBC in England. At Granada, Byrne became the first person to introduce the Beatles on television when they made their small-screen debut on local news programme Granada Reports.<ref name=montrose_chameleon/> In 1961, Telefís Éireann (later Radio Telefís Éireann and now Raidió Teilifís Éireann) was set up. Byrne finally worked exclusively for the new Irish service after 1969. He introduced many popular programmes, with his most popular and successful programme being The Late Late Show.<ref></ref>
==Radio career==
Byrne began his broadcasting career on radio. Radio Éireann gave him a 15-minute slot on Monday nights which he used to play Jazz, his first broadcast for the station being in 1958.<ref name=montrose_chameleon/>
He is now best remembered for his two-hour morning show, The Gay Byrne Hour, which was later renamed The Gay Byrne Show (1972–1999). For many years the show was produced by John Caden. Joe Duffy was a reporter and occasional co-presenter on The Gay Byrne Show.<ref></ref>
Byrne featured on radio occasionally since retiring from The Gay Byrne Show – in 2006, he began presenting a weekly Sunday afternoon show entitled Sunday Serenade on RTÉ lyric fm. After 2010, he could be heard playing jazz on Sunday afternoons on lyric fm.<ref name=montrose_chameleon/> This two-hour show began after an encounter with Head of Lyric FM Aodán Ó Dubhghaill at the National Concert Hall.<ref name=montrose_chameleon/> Sunday with Gay Byrne attracted 55,000 listeners through "word of mouth": no advertising and no mention in the RTÉ Guide.<ref name=montrose_chameleon/> The show was broadcast weekly approximately from September to March, with a break during the intervening six months. Byrne once commented on the emptiness of RTÉ at this time of the week: 
==Television==
===The Late Late Show===
On 5 July 1962, the first episode of The Late Late Show was aired on Irish television.<ref name=montrose_chameleon/> Originally the show was scheduled as an eight-week summer filler. The programme, which is still broadcast, has become the world's second longest running chat show. The show became a forum where controversial topics such as the influence of the Roman Catholic Church, Birth control,<ref name=montrose_chameleon/> AIDS, unemployment, homosexuality,<ref name=montrose_chameleon/> abortion, divorce and other hitherto taboo subjects were discussed openly in Ireland, alongside book reviews, celebrity visits, and music acts such as the Boomtown Rats, U2, Sinéad O'Connor, Elkie Brooks, Boyzone and Noel Gallagher. Other guests included President of Ireland, successive Archbishops of Armagh, minor members of the British Royal Family, politicians, actors and authors.
The show had much to do in shaping the new Ireland that was emerging from the 1960s. Indeed, it was famously said by politician and Papal Knight, Oliver J. Flanagan that, "there was no sex in Ireland until Teilifís Éireann went on the air".<ref></ref> Bishop of Galway Michael Browne called him "a purveyor of filth" after he asked a woman what colour nightie she wore on her wedding night and she had replied that she believed she'd worn nothing.<ref name=montrose_chameleon/><ref></ref>
More than a decade after departing his role as host of The Late Late Show Byrne is remembered for conducting memorable interviews with former politician Pádraig Flynn and then Bishop of Galway Eamon Caseys lover Annie Murphy, among others.<ref name=montrose_chameleon/> Another memorable moment to occur on The Late Late Show was when he called the winner of a prize car live on air only to discover the woman's daughter had died since she had entered.<ref name=montrose_chameleon/>
During the early years of Byrne's time hosting The Late Late Show, prior to about 1978 when the second national Irish TV channel was launched, he was employed by RTÉ on a continuously renewing 3-month contract, lest his employer might want to fire him any time they choose.<ref>RTÉ television documentary aired in March 2007</ref>
Byrne and The Late Late Show were central to the development of the careers of figures such as Mary Coughlan.<ref></ref>
He was noted for wearing a "Bing Crosby sweater" when presenting The Late Late Toy Show.<ref name=montrose_chameleon/>
On 21 May 1999, Byrne presented his last edition of The Late Late Show. He was presented with a Harley-Davidson motorcycle by Bono and Larry Mullen, Jr.<ref name=montrose_chameleon/> Pat Kenny succeeded Byrne as presenter in September 1999, subsequently succeeded by Ryan Tubridy in September 2009. Byrne gave Tubridy his blessing upon taking over the role, saying: "He has all the qualities required, the light deft touch together with a serious mind. I think it's a great adventure that he's setting off on".<ref name=talks_tubridy_and_lls></ref> Byrne returned to The Late Late Show as a guest twice during Tubridy's first season as presenter, the latter appearance on the day of Gerry Ryan's death.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
===The Meaning of Life===
In April 2009, RTÉ One began broadcasting a series called The Meaning of Life, during which Gay Byrne interviewed public figures about issues of meaning and life.<ref></ref> He preferred not to discuss his own faith: The programme has contained a number of significant moments, including actor Gabriel Byrne's admission that he had been abused as a child at the start of the second series<ref></ref><ref></ref> and Stephen Fry's denunciation of God during the tenth series.
===Other television work===
In the 1960s, Byrne presented Let's Dance for Granada Television with popular singing star Marion Ryan. The programme was filmed in the Ballroom at Belle Vue, Manchester and also featured original Come Dancing stars Syd Perkin and Edna Duffield.
Byrne compèred the finals of the Castlebar Song Contest in 1966 and 1967. He also presented the Rose of Tralee festival for 17 years until 1994. Between 1989 and 2001, Byrne hosted the RTÉ People in Need Telethon several times.<ref></ref>
After "retiring", Byrne hosted the Irish version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?.<ref></ref> He also hosted The Gay Byrne Music Show and Make 'Em Laugh, a series about comedy in Ireland, Gaybo's Grumpy Men and Class Reunion.
In the summer season of 2000, Byrne hosted The Gay Byrne Music Show, which was a studio-based show aired on Saturday nights as a summer filler between 8 July and 19 August 2000 and showcased all genres of music in the company of the RTÉ Concert Orchestra. From 2011, he presented more summer filler light entertainment in the form of For One Night Only.<ref></ref>
==Retirement==
Byrne did not completely retire and continued to feature occasionally on radio and television after leaving The Late Late Show and The Gay Byrne Show. He launched Joe Duffy's autobiography Just Joe in Harry's Bar in October 2011.<ref></ref>
In March 2006, Byrne was appointed as the chairman of the Irish Road Safety Authority,<ref></ref><ref></ref> a public body given the task of improving road safety in the Republic of Ireland. The role saw him visit hospitalised survivors alongside President of Ireland Mary McAleese.<ref></ref>
===Politics===
====Views====
In "retirement", Byrne continued to make his political views known, including questioning then Taoiseach Brian Cowen and "whether you can be Taoiseach and still sit up and have a pint in the local pub. You have to dignify the office".<ref></ref> In later years he become known for his anti-EU stance.<ref></ref> Bookmakers suggested Byrne might become Mayor of Dublin.<ref></ref>
====Presidential prospects====
In August 2011, Byrne was approached<ref></ref> by the once dominant political party Fianna Fáil as a possible independent nominee<ref></ref> for that year's presidential election. The media advised Byrne, who had enjoyed an avuncular relationship with the public as a performer over many decades, against such a move. An editorial in the Irish Independent said: "This isn't some sort of a reality TV show but a contest for the highest office in the land." The Irish Times queried the distinction between Byrne as a performer versus Byrne as an individual. "But who is it that the Irish people really love? Is it Gaybo or Gabriel Byrne? Given they don't really know the man himself – a man who has retained his privacy throughout a lifetime of fame – the love is surely for the persona rather than the person."<ref></ref> Byrne topped polls as the candidate people were most likely to vote for.<ref name=bbc_presidency></ref><ref name=guardian_presidency></ref>
On 13 August 2011, Byrne announced that he would not be a candidate for the Presidency.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Appearing later on TV3's Midweek programme he called Martin McGuinness, who was contesting the election as a representative of Sinn Féin, a "liar".<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
===One-man show===
Byrne performed a one-man show in front of a sold-out audience at the Gate Theatre on 18 September 2011. The performance was part of a benefit night to raise funds for the Irish Cancer Society. British Ambassador Julian King and Senator David Norris were among those in attendance.<ref name=masterful_uncle_gay_enthralls_full_house></ref>
==Personal life==
Byrne was married to Kathleen Watkins,<ref></ref><ref></ref> formerly a well-known harpist. Watkins was also the first continuity announcer to appear on-screen on the opening night of Telefís Éireann on New Year's Eve in 1961.<ref></ref> Byrne first met Watkins, a native of Saggart, County Dublin, in 1957. They married in Saggart Catholic church in 1964.<ref name=montrose_chameleon/><ref>Byrne, The Time of My Life, p. 99</ref> The couple had two daughters, Suzy and Crona.<ref name=montrose_chameleon/> The Byrne family lived on Howth Head in Dublin and in later years in Sandymount in Dublin. Byrne became a grandfather on 15 September 2004 when Suzy gave birth to a boy at Holles Street Hospital. His first grandson was Cian O’Byrne. Cian has represented his grandfather at different events. Cian also helped launched Byrne's wife Kathleen's children's book Pigín of Howth. He has also appeared on the Ray D’Arcy Show. After Byrne's funeral, Cian was publicly praised by many for the dignity he showed and has been tipped to follow in his grandfather's footsteps. President Higgins has described him as a “remarkable young man”.<ref></ref>
Byrne relied on an accountant friend, Russell Murphy, to manage his finances, and was personally distraught when upon the accountant's death in 1986, it was found that most of his savings had been squandered, and this had been hidden from him.<ref> This is referenced on the Irish Independent website in an article by Tom Brady.</ref>
His interests included jazz.<ref name=montrose_chameleon/> He continued to play jazz on the radio during his "retirement".<ref name=montrose_chameleon/>
He was a qualified private pilot.<ref></ref>
===Health===
In later years, Byrne revealed he had hearing loss in one ear. He thought originally that it was due to working in the television and radio industry for over 50 years that caused his hearing loss, but later found out it was genetic as his mother, his sister and three brothers all had hearing problems.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
In 2011, Byrne experienced a health scare at his home in Sandymount when he struggled to breathe. He was admitted to St Vincent's hospital complaining his lungs felt as if they were "made of concrete" and there was "nothing going in" and that he expected to die. In 2015, after spending Christmas at home with his family, he had a heart attack and was readmitted to hospital.<ref></ref>
On 20 November 2016, he revealed live on his Time Warp radio broadcast on RTÉ Lyric FM that he was to begin treatment for prostate cancer, and that the cancer might have also spread to his lower back. He told listeners he would be taking a one-week break before returning to work. However, he did not return to the air. Byrne had been quoted by the Daily Mirror saying that "Ideally, I would like to get back to doing my Sunday afternoon radio show on Lyric FM, but my wife and daughters tell me I'm not ready and won't let me do it."<ref></ref>
===Death===
Byrne died on 4 November 2019 at his home in Howth peacefully surrounded by his family, aged 85, after a long illness.<ref name="auto"/><ref></ref>

The funeral mass was celebrated by Fr Leonard Moloney SJ. Gay's daughter Suzy welcomed mourners with a moving speech which thanked all who had helped her father through his illness and she also thanked her father. Byrne's coffin was carried by family and friends, including his eldest grandson Cian.
After the mass, the hearse carrying Byrne's remains made its way back to Howth and was greeted by fans along the route. He was laid to rest, privately at Saint Fintans Cemetery, Sutton.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Following his death, the country of Ireland went into mourning as Gay was described as the most influential person in the history of Ireland.

==Legacy==
Credited with being a catalyst in the transformation of Irish society since the 1960s,<ref></ref> Byrne broke several societal taboos by engaging in discourse on subjects like Birth control, homosexuality, and abortion.<ref name=man_who_changed_ireland/> For example, when Barry Galvin—then Cork's state solicitor—guested with Byrne on The Late Late Show in 1992 to discuss Ireland's mounting problems with the illegal drug trade, he was subsequently given the post of first ever head of the important Criminal Assets Bureau.<ref name=man_who_changed_ireland/> Alongside Terry Wogan, Byrne was one of two Irish broadcast giants,<ref></ref> but was also described as solely "the most famous Irish broadcaster in history",<ref name=walking_on_air/> and lauded by the media as "the man who changed Ireland".<ref name=man_who_changed_ireland/>
According to the Irish Examiner, Byrne "had more influence on changing life in this country than any of the political leaders", including Taoisigh W. T. Cosgrave, Éamon de Valera and John A. Costello, as well as Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, John Charles McQuaid, the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin and Primate of Ireland for over 30 years.<ref name=man_who_changed_ireland></ref> A 1998 poll found Byrne level with notorious former Taoiseach Charles Haughey as the most hated public figure in the country, but the same poll also found Byrne to be the most popular public figure.<ref name=man_who_changed_ireland/>
