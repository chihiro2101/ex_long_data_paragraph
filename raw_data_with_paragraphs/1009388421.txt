Taser

== Lethality ==
The TASER device is a less-lethal, not non-lethal, weapon. Sharp metal projectiles and electricity are in use, so misuse or abuse of the weapon increases the likelihood that serious injury or death may occur. In addition, the manufacturer has identified other risk factors that may increase the risks of use. Children, pregnant women, the elderly, and very thin individuals are considered at higher risk. Persons with known medical problems, such as heart disease, history of seizure, or have a pacemaker are also at greater risk. Axon also warns that repeated, extended, or continuous exposure to the weapon is not safe. Because of this, the Police Executive Research Forum says that total exposure should not exceed 15 seconds.<ref></ref>
There are other circumstances that pose higher secondary risks of serious injury or death, including:<ref name="CEW" />
* Uncontrolled falls or subjects falling from elevated positions
* Persons running on hard or rough surfaces, like asphalt
* Persons operating machinery or conveyance (cars, motorcycles, bikes, skateboards)
* Places where explosive or flammable substances are present

== Drive Stun capability ==
Some TASER device models, particularly those used by police departments, also have a "Drive Stun" capability, where the TASER device is held against the target without firing the projectiles, and is intended to cause pain without incapacitating the target. "Drive Stun" is "the process of using the EMD (Electro Muscular Disruption) weapon as a pain compliance technique. This is done by activating the TASER device and placing it against an individual's body. This can be done without an air cartridge in place or after an air cartridge has been deployed."<ref name="MMRMA"></ref>
Guidelines released in 2011 by the U.S. Department of Justice recommend that use of Drive Stun as a pain compliance technique be avoided.<ref name="PERFCOPS"></ref> The guidelines were issued by a joint committee of the Police Executive Research Forum and the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services. The guidelines state "Using the CEW to achieve pain compliance may have limited effectiveness and, when used repeatedly, may even exacerbate the situation by inducing rage in the subject".
A study of U.S. police and sheriff departments found that 29.6% of the jurisdictions allowed the use of Drive Stun for gaining compliance in a passive resistance arrest scenario, with no physical contact between the officer and the subject. For a scenario that also includes non-violent physical contact, this number is 65.2%.<ref name="NIJEV"></ref>
A Las Vegas police document says "The Drive Stun causes significant localized pain in the area touched by the TASER CEW, but does not have a significant effect on the central nervous system. The Drive Stun does not incapacitate a subject but may assist in taking a subject into custody."<ref> urltoken Use of the Taser, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department</ref> The UCLA Taser incident<ref></ref> and the University of Florida Taser incident<ref name="offensereport"></ref> involved university police officers using their TASER device's "Drive Stun" capability (referred to as a "contact tase" in the University of Florida Offense Report).
Amnesty International has expressed particular concern about Drive Stun, noting that "the potential to use TASERs in drive-stun mode—where they are used as 'pain compliance' tools when individuals are already effectively in custody—and the capacity to inflict multiple and prolonged shocks, renders the weapons inherently open to abuse".<ref></ref>
== Users ==
According to a 2011 study by the United States Department of Justice's National Institute of Justice entitled Police Use of Force, TASERs and Other Less-Lethal Weapons,<ref></ref> over 15,000 law enforcement and military agencies around the world used TASER devices as part of their use of force continuum. Just as the number of agencies deploying TASER conducted energy weapons has continued to increase each year, so too the number of TASER device related "incidents" between law enforcement officers and suspects has been on the rise.
In 2015, police in North Dakota were cleared to operate drone aircraft equipped with tear gas and TASER CEWs.<ref></ref>
== Excited delirium syndrome==
Some of the deaths associated with TASER devices have been given a diagnosis of excited delirium, a term for a phenomenon that manifests as a combination of delirium, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, hallucinations, speech disturbances, disorientation, violent and bizarre behavior, insensitivity to pain, elevated body temperature, and increased strength.<ref name="ACEP white paper"> urltoken "White Paper Report on Excited Delirium Syndrome" , ACEP Excited Delirium Task Force, American College of Emergency Physicians, September 10, 2009</ref><ref name="Grant et al."></ref> Excited delirium is associated with sudden death (usually via cardiac or respiratory arrest), particularly following the use of physical control measures, including police restraint and TASER devices.<ref name="ACEP white paper"/><ref name="Grant et al."/> Excited delirium most commonly arises in male subjects with a history of serious mental illness or acute or chronic drug abuse, particularly stimulant drugs such as cocaine.<ref name="ACEP white paper"/><ref name=SoRelle></ref> Alcohol withdrawal or head trauma may also contribute to the condition.<ref name=pmid19557101></ref>
The diagnosis of excited delirium has been controversial.<ref name=NPR1/><ref name=abc/> Excited delirium has been listed as a cause of death by some medical examiners for several years,<ref></ref><ref></ref> mainly as a diagnosis of exclusion established on autopsy.<ref name="ACEP white paper"/> Additionally, academic discussion of excited delirium has been largely confined to forensic science literature, providing limited documentation about patients that survive the condition.<ref name="ACEP white paper"/> These circumstances have led some civil liberties groups to question the cause of death diagnosis, claiming that excited delirium has been used to "excuse and exonerate" law enforcement agency following the death of detained subjects, a possible "conspiracy or cover-up for brutality" when restraining agitated individuals.<ref name="ACEP white paper"/><ref name=NPR1></ref><ref name=abc></ref> Also contributing to the controversy is the role of TASER device use in excited delirium deaths.<ref name=SoRelle/><ref name=npr3></ref>
Excited delirium is not found in the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; however. the term "excited delirium" has been accepted by the National Association of Medical Examiners and the American College of Emergency Physicians, who argued in a 2009 white paper that "excited delirium" may be described by several codes within the ICD-9.<ref name="ACEP white paper"/> The American College of Emergency Physicians "rejects the theory" that excited delirium is an "invented syndrome" used to excuse or cover-up the use of excessive force by law enforcement.<ref name=DeBard></ref>
== Use on children ==
There has been considerable controversy over the use of TASER devices on children and in schools. In 2004, the parents of a 6-year-old boy in Miami sued the police department for firing a TASER device at their child.<ref name="CNN Children" /> The police said the boy was threatening to injure his own leg with a shard of glass, and said that using the device was the safest option to prevent the boy from injuring himself. Nevertheless, the boy's mother told CNN that the three officers involved probably found it easier not to reason with her child.<ref name="CNN Children" /> Also in 2004, a 12-year-old girl skipping school and drinking alcohol was tased in Miami-Dade while she was running from police and started to run into traffic. The TASER device was successfully deployed to stop her from being hit by cars or causing an automobile accident.<ref name="CNN Children">CNN, Susan Candiotti, contributor. urltoken Police review policy after Tasers used on kids November 15, 2004</ref> In March 2008, an 11-year-old girl was subdued with a TASER device.<ref></ref> In March 2009, a 15-year-old boy died from alcohol-induced excited delirium<ref></ref> in Michigan after being tased.<ref></ref>
Police claim that the use of TASER conducted energy weapons on smaller subjects and elderly subjects is safer than alternative methods of subduing suspects, alleging that striking them or falling on them will cause much more injury than a TASER device, because the device is designed to only cause the contraction of muscles. Critics counter that TASER devices may interact with pre-existing medical complications such as medications, and may even contribute to someone's death as a result. Critics also suggest that using a TASER conducted electrical weapon on a minor, particularly a young child, is effectively cruel and abusive punishment, or unnecessary.<ref> urltoken Kansas Students Speak Out Against Tasers In Schools April 6, 2006</ref><ref> urltoken Teen dies after being shot by stun gun November 1, 2006</ref><ref> urltoken "Tasers Implicated in Excited Delirium Deaths".

== Use in torture ==
A report from a meeting of the United Nations Committee Against Torture states that "The Committee was worried that the use of TASER X26 weapons, provoking extreme pain, constituted a form of torture, and that in certain cases it could also cause death, as shown by several reliable studies and by certain cases that had happened after practical use."<ref> urltoken Committee against Torture Concludes Thirty-Ninth Session, press release, United Nations Office at Geneva, November 23, 2007.

Maurice Cunningham of South Carolina, while an inmate at the Lancaster County Detention Center,<ref></ref><ref></ref> was subjected to continuous shock for 2 minutes 49 seconds, which a medical examiner said caused cardiac arrhythmia and his subsequent death. He was 29 years old and had no alcohol or drugs in his system.<ref> urltoken Amnesty International's continuing concerns about Taser use 2006</ref>
In response to the claims that the pain inflicted by the use of the TASER device could potentially constitute torture, Tom Smith, the Chairman of the TASER Board, stated that the U.N. is "out of touch" with the needs of modern policing and asserted that "Pepper spray goes on for hours and hours, hitting someone with a baton breaks limbs, shooting someone with a firearm causes permanent damage, even punching and kicking—the intent of those tools is to inflict pain,&nbsp;. with the TASER device, the intent is not to inflict pain; it's to end the confrontation. When it's over, it's over."<ref></ref>

A Taser (also spelled tazer) is a non-lethal electroshock weapon used to incapacitate targets via shocks that temporarily impair the target's physical function to a level that allows them to be approached and handled in an unresisting and thus safe manner. It is sold by Axon, formerly TASER International.<ref> urltoken TASER X26 </ref> It fires two small barbed darts intended to puncture the skin and remain attached to the target, at 180 feet (55 m) per second. Their range extends from 15 feet (4.57 m) for non-Law Enforcement Tasers to 35 feet (10.67 m) for LE Tasers. The darts are connected to the main unit by thin insulated copper wire and deliver a modulated electric current designed to disrupt voluntary control of muscles, causing "neuromuscular incapacitation", which is often mistaken for unconsciousness by police officers and bystanders. The effects of a Taser device may only be localized pain or strong involuntary long muscle contractions, based on the mode of use and connectivity of the darts.<ref> urltoken "Neuromuscular Incapacitation (NMI)", TASER International, published March 12, 2007. Retrieved May 19, 2007 </ref><ref>International Association of Chiefs of Police, urltoken Electro Muscular Disruption Technology: A Nine-Step Strategy for Effective Deployment , 2005</ref>
The Taser device is marketed as less-lethal, since the Taser safety issues whenever the weapon is deployed.<ref name="CEW"></ref> At least 49 people died in 2018 after being shocked by police with a Taser.
The first Taser conducted energy weapon was introduced in 1993<ref name="Axon Leadership Axon"></ref>  
The TASER 7 device is the newest of all three CEWs. It is a two-shot device with spiral darts that spool from the dart allowing the probes to fly straighter. The TASER 7 device's rapid arc technology with adaptive cross connections allows for full incapacitation. The TASER 7 CEW connects wirelessly to the Axon network of software that includes inventory management capabilities using Axon Evidence.<ref name="Taser 7 OG TItle Axon"/>
