Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster

==Family and other businesses==
The Grosvenor family's first development was in Mayfair, Central London, in the early 18th century; the second big development came around 100 years later and was in another exclusive part of London – Belgravia, developed by the family after the end of Napoleonic Wars and the conversion of Buckingham Palace – which is just one mile East. After developing the two parts of Central London, the family business expanded. During the second half of the 20th century, the business expanded into the Americas and developed Annacis Island and Vancouver, both in British Columbia in the west of Canada in the 1950s. The family business started developing in Australia in the 1960s. They moved to Asia in the early 1990s and to Continental Europe just before the millennium. In April 2000, the firm moved into new London offices. The business was headed by the 6th Duke himself, who was Chairman of the Trustees.
The Duke was also Director of Claridge's Hotel from 1981 until 1993, and of Marcher Sound from 1992 until 1997.<ref name= ww></ref>

As a child the Duke lived on an island in the middle of Lower Lough Erne in Ulster (Ely Lodge, Blaney, County Fermanagh). His early education was in Northern Ireland before he was sent at age 7 to boarding school at Sunningdale, followed by Harrow. Because of his Ulster accent, the Duke struggled to fit in at first, and even after his accent was "bullied" out of him, he found it difficult to make friends.

After a troubled education, he left school with two O-levels. He entered the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, and served in the Territorial Army, where he was promoted to major-general in 2004.
Via Grosvenor Estates, the business he inherited along with the dukedom in 1979, the Duke was the richest property developer in the United Kingdom and one of the country's largest landowners, with property in Edinburgh, Liverpool, Oxford, Cambridge, Southampton and Cheshire, including the family's country seat of Eaton Hall, as well as of Mayfair and Belgravia in Central London.<ref></ref> The business also has interests in other parts of Europe. According to The Sunday Times Rich List in 2016, the Duke was worth £9.35&nbsp;billion, placing him sixth in the list and making him the third-richest British citizen.
The Duke died on 9 August 2016 after suffering a heart attack. The title then passed to his son, Hugh.
