Seyyed Hossein Nasr

==Biography==
===Origins===
Nasr was born in 1933 in south-central Tehran to Seyyed Valiallah, who was a physician to the Persian royal family, and one of the founders of modern education in Iran. He wrote many essays which still remain in manuscript form, some of which have been assembled by Nasr into a book called Danish wa Akhlaq (‘‘Knowledge and Ethics’’).<ref>Ramin Jahanbegloo, In Search of the Sacred : A Conversation with Seyyed Hossein Nasr on His Life and Thought, ABC-CLIO (2010), p. 4</ref> His parents were originally from Kashan. He is a descendant of Sheikh Fazlollah Nouri from his mother's side, through him is related to the communist Noureddin Kianouri, is the cousin of Iranian philosopher Ramin Jahanbegloo as well as the father of American academic Vali Nasr.
===Education===
Nasr went to Firuz Bahram High School in Tehran<ref>جهانبگلو. رامین. در جستجوی امر قدسی (مصاحبه با دکتر نصر). نشر نی. 1385<br>Interview with Ramin Jahanbegloo in: Dar Jostejooye Amr e Qodsi. p.229</ref> before being sent to the United States for education at thirteen. In the US, Nasr first attended Peddie School in Hightstown, New Jersey, graduating in 1950 as the valedictorian of his class and also winner of the Wyclifte Award.<ref>Sheikh, Nadia. urltoken "Islamic scholar calls GW home" , The GW Hatchet, February 20, 2007. Accessed February 5, 2011. "As a 12-year-old, Nasr came to the United States to study at the Peddie School, a New Jersey boarding school where he graduated in 1950 as valedictorian."</ref>
A scholarship offered by MIT in physics made him the first Iranian undergraduate to attend that university.<ref name="nasr.org"></ref> There, he also began studying under Giorgio de Santillana and others in various other branches such as metaphysics and philosophy. During his studies there he became acquainted with the works of the Traditionalist authority Frithjof Schuon. This school of thought has shaped Nasr's life and thinking ever since. Nasr had been a disciple of Frithjof Schuon for over fifty years and his works are based on the doctrine and the viewpoints of the perennial philosophy.
After receiving an MIT SB degree in physics in 1954, Nasr obtained a master's degree in geology and geophysics in 1956, and went on to pursue his PhD degree in the history of science and learning at Harvard University. He planned to write his dissertation under the supervision of George Sarton, but Sarton died before he could begin his dissertation work and so he wrote his dissertation under the direction of I. Bernard Cohen, Hamilton Gibb, and Harry Wolfson.
At the age of twenty-five, Nasr graduated with a PhD from Harvard and completed his first book, Science and Civilization in Islam, the title being a direct tribute to Science and Civilization in China, the work by Joseph Needham which had for task to present to Westerners the complex developments of the history of science and technology in China, a mission Nasr was himself following for the Muslim world, "although I was working single-handedly, a twenty-five-year-old scholar, and he had a whole group working with him at Cambridge".<ref>Ramin Jahanbegloo, In Search of the Sacred : A Conversation with Seyyed Hossein Nasr on His Life and Thought, ABC-CLIO (2010), p. 53</ref> His doctoral dissertation entitled "Conceptions of Nature in Islamic Thought" was published in 1964 by Harvard University Press as An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines.
Apart from mastering Arabic he was initially taught in his childhood, during his student years, Nasr also learned different languages, namely French (he could read Guénon and Schuon in the text), Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish and German (mainly to work on Hegel for his PhD thesis).<ref>Ramin Jahanbegloo, In Search of the Sacred : A Conversation with Seyyed Hossein Nasr on His Life and Thought, ABC-CLIO (2010), p. 47</ref>
===Back to Iran===
Nasr began his teaching career in 1955 when he was still a young doctoral student at Harvard University.
After Harvard, Nasr returned to Iran as a professor at the University of Tehran, and also served as the President of Aryamehr University (now Sharif University of Technology) from 1972 to 1975.<ref name="Ramin" />
Nasr also learned Islamic philosophy from the philosophers Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i, Allameh Sayyed Abul Hasan Rafiee Qazvini and Sayyid Muhammad Kazim Assar during the period leading up to the Revolution.<ref name="Ramin" />
Nasr was appointed personal secretary to Farah Pahlavi, Empress of Iran, as Head of the Empress's Private Bureau.<ref name="Knight">Knight, Michael M. William S. Burroughs vs. The Qur'an, Soft Skull Press, Berkley 2012, p61</ref> In 1974 she commissioned him to establish and lead the Imperial Iranian Academy of Philosophy (now the Institute for Research in Philosophy),<ref name="Knight" /> the first academic institution to be conducted in accordance with the intellectual principles of the Traditionalist School. During that time, Nasr, Tabataba'i, William Chittick, Peter Lamborn Wilson, Kenneth Morgan, Sachiko Murata, Toshihiko Izutsu, and Henry Corbin held various philosophical discourses. The book Shi'ite Islam was one product of this period.
===Return to the West===
Upon his return to the west, Nasr took up positions at University of Edinburgh, Temple University, and since 1984 has been at The George Washington University where he is now a full-time University Professor of Islamic Studies.
Nasr helped with the planning and expansion of Islamic and Iranian studies academic programs in several universities such as Princeton, the University of Utah, and the University of Southern California.
He was an advisor for the award-winning, PBS-broadcast documentary Muhammad: Legacy of a Prophet (2002), produced by Unity Productions Foundation.<ref></ref>
==Views on evolution==
Nasr rejects the Evolution,<ref></ref><ref></ref> claiming that it is "an ideology, it is not ordinary science"<ref></ref> and "more a pseudo-religion than a scientific theory."<ref></ref> The sociologist Farzin Vahdat sees this as part of Nasr's rejection of secular reason and secular science, and more broadly of the modern world.<ref></ref>
