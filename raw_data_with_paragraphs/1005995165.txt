Sinicization

==Modern examples==
=== Kuomintang ===
The Kuomintang pursued a sinicization policy, which foreign observers understood as "the time had come to set about the business of making all natives either turn Chinese or get out." It was noted that "Chinese colonization" of "Mongolia and Manchuria" led to the conclusion "to a conviction that the day of the barbarian was finally over."<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
=== Ma Clique ===
Hui Muslim General Ma Fuxiang created an assimilationist group and encouraged the integration of Muslims into Chinese society.<ref></ref> Ma Fuxiang was a hardcore assimilationist and said that Hui should assimilate into Han.<ref></ref>
=== Xinjiang ===
The Hui Muslim 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army) governed the southern region of East Turkestan (named Xinjiang by the Chinese government) in 1934–1937. The administration that was set up was colonial in nature, importing Han cooks and baths,<ref></ref> changing into Chinese the street signs and names that used to be in only Uyghur language. The Hui also switched carpet patterns from Uyghur to Han in state-owned carpet factories.<ref></ref>
Strict surveillance and mass detentions of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang re-education camps is a part of the ongoing sinicization policy by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).<ref></ref> Since 2015, it has been estimated that over a million Uyghurs have been detained in these camps.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> The camps were established under CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping's administration with the main goal of ensuring adherence to national ideology.<ref></ref> Critics of China's treatment of Uyghurs have accused the Chinese government of propagating a policy of sinicization in Xinjiang in the 21st century, calling this policy a cultural genocide, or ethnocide, of Uyghurs.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>
=== Taiwan ===
After the Republic of China took control of Taiwan in 1945 and relocated its capital to Taipei in 1949, the intention of Chiang Kai-shek was to eventually go back to mainland China and retake control of it. Chiang believed that to retake mainland China, it would be necessary to re-Sinicize Taiwan's inhabitants who had undergone assimilation under Japanese rule. Examples of this policy included the renaming of streets with mainland geographical names, use of Mandarin Chinese in schools and punishments for using other regional languages (such as the fāngyán of Hakka and Hokkien), and teaching students to revere traditional ethics, develop pan-Chinese nationalism, and view Taiwan from the perspective of China.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Other reasons for the policy were to combat the Japanese influences on the culture that had occurred in the previous 50 years, and to help unite the recent immigrants from mainland China that had come to Taiwan with the KMT and among whom there was a tendency to be more loyal to Ancestral home (Chinese) than to China as a nation.<ref></ref>
The process of re-asserting non-Chinese identity, as in the case of ethnic groups in Taiwan, is sometimes known as desinicization. This is an issue in, for example, the Taiwan independence movement and Taiwanization.
=== Tibet ===
The sinicization of Tibet is the change of Tibetan society to Han Chinese standards by means of state propaganda, police presence, cultural assimilation, religious persecution, immigration, population transfer, land development, land transfer, and political reform.<ref>Burbu, Dawa (2001) China's Tibet Policy, Routledge, , pp. 100–124</ref><ref name="Samdup">Samdup, Tseten (1993) urltoken Chinese population—Threat to Tibetan identity </ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> It has been underway since the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1951.<ref></ref> In present-day Tibet, traditional Tibetan festivals have "been turned into a platform for propaganda and political theater” where "government workers and retirees are barred from engaging in religious activities, and government workers and students in Tibetan schools are forbidden from visiting local monasteries.”<ref></ref> According to president of the Central Tibetan Administration, Lobsang Sangay, with the ongoing expulsion of monks and nuns from monasteries and nunneries, and destruction of the Larung Gar monastery,<ref></ref> Tibet's largest Buddhist institution, "unfortunately what is happening is that the Chinese government is reviving something akin to cultural revolution in Tibet."<ref></ref><ref></ref>
===Religion===
In April 2016, CCP general secretary Xi Jinping declared that in order to “actively guide the adaptation of religions to socialist society, an important task is supporting China’s religions’ persistence in the direction of sinicization.”<ref name="diplomat-2018"></ref><ref></ref> He later reiterated this plan to the 19th Communist Party Congress saying “We will fully implement the Party’s basic policy on religious affairs, insist on the sinicization of Chinese religions, and provide active guidance for religion and socialism to coexist.”<ref name="diplomat-2018"/><ref></ref>
====Protestantism====
The Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) of Protestant churches in China has described the Boxer Rebellion and the anti-Christian movement of 1922-27 as early efforts to sinicize Christianity.<ref name="scmp-may-2019"></ref>
The TSPM and China Christian Council arranged a conference in Shanghai on August 4–6, 2014, commemorating the anniversary of the TSPM. This conference included a seminar on the sinicizaton of Christianity, with Fu Xianwei, chairman of the TSPM, saying “churches in China will continue to explore the sinicization of Christianity and ensure Christianity takes root in the soil of Chinese culture, ethnicity, and society. To advance the sinicization of Christianity, churches will need guidance and support from government agencies in charge of religious affairs.”<ref></ref><ref></ref>
In 2019, TSPM chairman Xu Xiaohong made a pledge to eliminate any Western "imprint" from Chinese faith saying "We must recognise that Chinese churches are surnamed ‘China’, not ‘the West’" and "No matter how much effort or time it takes, our resolution in upholding the Sinicisation of Protestantism will never change, and our determination to walk a path that is adapted to a socialist society will never waver."<ref name="scmp-may-2019"/>
====Catholicism====
In December 2016, the Ninth National Congress of the Chinese Catholic Representatives reaffirmed their plan for the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association to uphold the principle of independence and self-governance, along with the promotion of sinicization.<ref></ref>
In March 2018, Archbishop Paul Gallagher, Secretary for Relations with States within the Holy See's Secretariat of State, said that "two expressions or, more precisely, two principles stand out, which should interact with each other, namely “sinicization” and “inculturation.” I am convinced that an important intellectual and pastoral challenge arises in an almost natural way from the bringing together of these two terms, which indicate two real visions of the world."<ref></ref><ref></ref>
In June 2018, the Bishops' Conference of the Catholic Church in China and the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association issued a "Five-Year Plan on Carrying Forward the Catholic Church's Adherence to the Direction of Sinicization in Our Country".<ref></ref><ref></ref> This document includes provisions forbidding worship outside of designated church structures and government-authorized times, as well as participation of minors under the age of 18 in any religious services. Churches in Hebei province and the Yibin Diocese of Sichuan province began holding training seminars immediately.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
====Islam====
In 2015, paramount leader Xi Jinping first raised the issue of "Sinicization of Islam". In 2018, a confidential directive was issued ordering local officials to "prevent Islam from interfering with secular life and the state’s functions".<ref></ref>
Yang Faming, leader of the Islamic Association of China, said in a 2018 speech that "We must allow traditional Chinese culture to permeate Islam and jointly guard the spiritual homeland of the Chinese people."<ref></ref> He encouraged Chinese characteristics to be present in religious ceremony, culture, and architecture.<ref name="diplomat-2018"/>
In 2018, over one million Chinese government workers began forcibly living in the homes of Uyghur Muslim families to monitor and assess resistance to assimilation, and to watch for frowned-upon religious or cultural practices.<ref name=":23"></ref><ref name=":8"></ref> These government workers were trained to call themselves "relatives" and have been described in Chinese state media as being a key part of enhancing "ethnic unity". <ref name=":23" />
, it was estimated that Chinese authorities may have detained one and a half million people in secretive re-education camps. The vast majority of those forcibly interned are Muslim Uyghurs but others including Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and other ethnic Turkic Muslims, Christians as well as some foreign citizens such as Kazakhstanis, are being held in these secretive internment camps as well.<ref></ref>
==In popular culture==
In some forms of fiction, due to China's communist statehood, Soviet-themed characters are de-Sovietized and switched over to become Chinese to fit modern (post-Cold War) times. 
The original cut of the 2012 Red Dawn remake depicted a Chinese invasion before having said information leaked to Global Times, sparking controversy in China and threatening its airing in the country (the invaders were changed to North Koreans).<ref name="Red Dawn Villains Switced"></ref>
In 2006, Chinese versions of the Marvel Comics' Crimson Dynamo and Chang Lam were created and made members of The Liberators in The Ultimates 2.
