Pantherophis obsoletus

==Geographic range==
Pantherophis obsoletus is found west of the Mississippi River, from eastern and southern Iowa southward through Missouri and Arkansas to western Louisiana, westward to eastern Texas, northward through Oklahoma and eastern Kansas to southeastern Nebraska.<ref>Powell R, Conant R, Collins JT (2016).

Aside from the usual variety that is black or has patches of black on a lighter background, color variations include
<!-- *The yellow rat snake, a yellowish color variant with four dark stripes along the body that is found along the coast of the Carolinas south through Georgia and Florida
*The Everglades rat snake, an orange variant with an isolated population in southern Florida's Everglades -->
the Texas rat snake, a brown-to-black variant, often with tinges of orange or red, that can be found in southern Oklahoma, Texas, and Louisiana.
==Habitat==
Rat snakes live in a variety of habitats; some overlap each other. Rat snakes are excellent climbers and spend time in trees. They live in habitats ranging from a rocky hillside to flat farmland.<ref name=nationalzoo></ref>
==Preferred habitat==
It prefers heavily wooded areas and is known for having excellent climbing ability, including the ability to climb the trunk of large mature trees without the aid of branches; the snake is also a competent swimmer. During winter it hibernates in dens, often with copperheads and timber rattlesnakes. This association gave rise to one of its common names, pilot black snake, and the superstition that this nonvenomous species led the venomous ones to the den.

Juveniles are strongly patterned with brown blotches on a gray background (like miniature fox snakes: P. gloydi, P. ramspotti, and P. vulpinus). Darkening occurs rapidly as they grow. Adults are glossy black above with white lips, chin, and throat. Sometimes traces of the "obsolete" juvenile pattern are still discernible in the skin between the scales, especially when stretched after a heavy meal.<ref name=b2/><ref>Conant R (1975).

==Behavior==
When not fully grown, rat snakes are subject to predation by many animals, including other snakes. Once they attain maturity, they are readily preyed on by Carnivora (including the American mink, which weighs no more than an adult rat snake) and large Bird of prey (especially red-tailed hawks).<ref name="mass"> urltoken Eastern Ratsnake. Pantherophis alleghaniensis. Natural Heritage Endangered Program. mass.gov</ref> When startled, they may freeze and wrinkle themselves into a series of kinks. If they feel further threatened, they may flee quickly or tail vibrate (potentially a form of mimicry, which makes them sound like rattlesnakes). They are also capable of producing a foul-smelling musk, which they will release onto predators if picked up. They spread the musk with their tails in hopes of deterring the threat.<ref> urltoken Fact Sheet at Smithsonian National Zoological Park Website . Nationalzoo.si.edu. Retrieved on 2012-12-19.</ref> When cornered or provoked, black snakes are known to stand their ground and can become aggressive. Counterattacks on large birds of prey, often committed by large snakes in excess of in length, have resulted in violent prolonged struggles. Utilizing its infamous agility and the great strength of its muscular coils, the black rat snake is sometimes able to overwhelm and kill formidable avian predators such as red-tailed hawks, great horned owls and red-shouldered hawks, though in many cases the bird is able to kill the snake and both combatants may even die.<ref>Bent AC (1937).

==Feeding==
This species is a constrictor, meaning it squeezes its prey to the point of cardiovascular collapse due to obstructive shock, coiling around small animals and tightening its grip until they can no longer circulate blood and die of profound hypotension, before eating them. Though they will often consume mice, voles, and rats, western rat snakes are far from specialists at this kind of prey and will readily consume any small vertebrate they can catch. Other prey opportunistically eaten by this species can include other snakes (including both those of their own and other species), frogs, lizards, chipmunks, squirrels, juvenile rabbits, juvenile opossums, songbirds, and bird eggs.<ref name=b2>Schmidt KP, Davis DD (1941). Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons. xiii + 365 pp. (Elaphe obsoleta obsolete, pp. 148-150, Figure 40 + Plate 16, center, on p. 336).</ref> One snake was observed to consume an entire clutch of Mallard eggs.<ref name="mass"/> Cavity-nesting bird species are seemingly especially prevalent in this snake's diet. The rat snake has been noted as perhaps the top predator at purple martin colonies as a single large snake will readily consume a number of eggs, hatchlings, and adults each summer. Several rat snake repelling methods have been offered to those putting up martin houses, but most are mixed in success.<ref> urltoken Rat Snakes . Purplemartin.org. Retrieved on 2012-12-19.</ref>
==Reproduction==
Mating takes place in late May and early June. The male snake wraps its tail around the female with their vents nearly touching. The male then everts one of its sex organs, a hemipenis, into the female sex organ, cloaca. The mating lasts a few minutes to a few hours. After five weeks, the female lays about 12 to 20 eggs, which are long by wide. The eggs hatch about 65 to 70 days later in late August to early October.<ref> urltoken Black snake profile at Smithsonian National Zoological Park website . Nationalzoo.si.edu.

==Taxonomy==
This species has previously been placed (and is still placed by many) in the genus Elaphe, as Elaphe obsoleta. However, Utiger et al. found that Elaphe is broadly construed as paraphyletic, and placed this species in the genus Pantherophis.<ref></ref> In addition, because Pantherophis is masculine, the specific epithet becomes the masculine obsoletus.<ref name="CNAH"> urltoken Elaphe obsoleta at urltoken The Center for North American Herpetology. Accessed 20 June 2008.</ref> The split of Pantherophis from Elaphe has been further confirmed by additional phylogenetic studies.<ref name="autogenerated2007"></ref><ref name="autogenerated1"></ref>
In 2001, Burbrink suggested this species be divided into three species based on geographic patterns of mitochondrial DNA diversity. He assigned new common names and resurrected old scientific names, resulting in the following combinations: eastern ratsnake (Elaphe alleghaniensis, now Pantherophis alleghaniensis), central ratsnake (Elaphe spiloides, now Pantherophis spiloides), and western rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta, now Pantherophis obsoletus). However, these three species are not morphologically distinct and overlap in all examined morphological characters.<ref></ref> More recent investigations have indicated P. alleghaniensis and P. spiloides interbreed freely in Ontario.<ref></ref>
In 2008, Collins and Taggart<ref></ref> resurrected the genus Scotophis for Burbrink's three taxa (i.e., Scotophis alleghaniensis, Scotophis spiloides, and Scotophis obsoletus) in response to the findings of Burbrink and Lawson, 2007.<ref name="autogenerated2007"/> The justification for this nomenclatural change has been removed by more recent research.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>
==In captivity==
Western rat snakes are popular as pets. Their size, calm temperament, and ease of care contribute to this popularity and they also occur in many mutations such as leucistic, albino, and scaleless. They enjoy hiding and burrowing which is usually accommodated with a loose substrate (such as aspen shavings or newspaper) and one or more hide boxes. Captive rat snakes are generally fed killed or stunned mice because captive-bred mice reduce the risk of exposing the snake to pathogens or live prey-induced injuries.
