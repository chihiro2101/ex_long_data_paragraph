Luke Rhinehart

==Early life==
George Powers Cockcroft was born on November 15, 1932 in Albany, New York to Donald and Elizabeth Cockcroft, both college graduates, his mother from Wellesley College.<ref name=guardian1/> He was raised in Albany, where his father was an electrical engineer,<ref name=guardian1/> and his ancestry included Vermont political notables.<ref>As Tanya Gold noted for an interview piece in The Guardian, "the creator of The Dice Man was born to New England grandees"; a great-grandfather and a grandfather were Vermont's Governor and Chief Justice of its Supreme Court, resepctively, in their time. See Gold, The Guardian, 4 March 2017, op. cit.</ref> He attended The Albany Academy, graduating in 1950, and received a BA from Cornell University in 1954 and an MA from Columbia University in 1956. In 1964 he received a PhD in American literature, also from Columbia. After obtaining his PhD, he went into teaching. During his years as a university professor he taught, among other things, courses in Zen and Western literature.
==Career==
In 1969, while Cockcroft was teaching a study abroad program on the island of Mallorca, an Englishman starting a new publishing house happened to stop at a cafe in the same village, Deià, and was given a partial manuscript of The Dice Man to read by Cockcroft. Cockcroft was subsequently offered an advance payment for publication. Shortly afterwards, Cockcroft was encouraged by his course Director to take an early sabbatical from his teaching duties. He remained in Mallorca to complete the novel, after which the publisher sold the American rights to the novel for a large sum, and within a year the film rights, allowing Cockcroft to retire from teaching and become a full time novelist.
==Personal life and family==
Cockroft married his wife, Ann, who would later become a writer of two romance novels and a volume of poetry, on June 30, 1956; together they have three children.<ref name=guardian1/> His brother, James Cockcroft, is the author of more than 20 books, mostly on Latin American history and society.
The author and his family spent a number of years traveling, sailing, and returning to Mallorca, living in Deià in the late 1960s and early 70s, <ref> urltoken Retrieved 20/12/2020.</ref> including time spent on a large catamaran which became the inspiration for the boat in his novel Long Voyage Back. In the mid 1970s they returned to the United States and spent 1975 in a sufi commune, before moving to a large old farmhouse and former religious retreat in the foothills of the Berkshires in upstate New York.
==Death==
On 1 August 2012, the "death" of Rhinehart at the age of 79 was announced by email to 25 friends, beginning with the words “It is our pleasure to inform you that Luke Rhinehart is dead”; it was later revealed the “Death Letter” was instigated as a playful hoax by Cockcroft. Reactions ranged from sorrow to gratitude and amusement.<ref name=independent1></ref>
Cockroft died in November 2020.<ref name="MyUser_The_Guardian_March_1_2021c"></ref>
==Books==
===Fiction===
====Comic philosophical novels====
A number of works authored by him have a similar style to The Dice Man and alternate between first- and third-person voice with selections from fictional documents.<ref></ref> In one case, he even quotes from a future book that he did not actually write until more than two decades later. The voices having different characteristics, the novel’s mood changes accordingly.
Presenting these multiple fragments from multiple viewpoints together resulted in a "cubist" narrative structure. Of this, Rhinehart stated hat they had “ always conceived of myself as being multiple – having, you know, a dozen different selves, if not a thousand different selves, at any given moment.”<ref name=guardian1/>
Rhinehart’s first novel The Dice Man, is a cult classic. It tells the story of a psychiatrist who, dissatisfied with his limited roles and routine life, begins to make life decisions based on the casting of dice. The novel expresses permissive attitudes towards charged subject matter such as rape, murder and sexual experimentation.
Adventures of Wim was an effort to create a new interpretation of the story of Wim, a Montauk boy born of a virgin mother, declared the savior of the Montauk nation, and his life quest for Ultimate Truth. The book is told through the medium of fictional documents.
The Search for the Dice Man (1993), set twenty years later, tells the story of Rhinehart’s son, Larry, who has built a highly successful and stable life, having rejected his father’s embracing of Chance.  On a quest to find his father however, Larry’s life of order and routine becomes enveloped in chaos, the legacy of his father’s work.
From a draft written at the same time as The Dice Man, Naked Before the World (2008) celebrates the lives of both hippies and the establishment in 1960s Mallorca through the story of Katya, an innocent Catholic art student who arrives on the island to study abroad. Katya is thrown into a world of artists, frauds, sex, drugs and the struggle to discover who she wants to be.
In Jesus Invades George: An Alternative History (2013), which takes place in 2007, then-sitting President George W. Bush is possessed by the spirit of Jesus Christ. The story playfully reveals and deconstructs the hypocrisy of government and modern politics.
In Invasion (2016), aliens invade Earth for the sole purpose of having fun. Hyper-intelligent and able to morph into multiple forms, they play games with culture and infrastructure, from computer networks and social media to corporate culture and human relationships. The resulting mayhem reveals the primitive nature of our society, and offers an alternative vision for the human race. A sequel is to be published entitled The Hairy Balls and the End of Civilization.<ref> urltoken 
==== Conventional novels ====
In Matari (1975)  (republished as White Wind, Black Rider (2008)) is historical fiction set in 18th Century Japan, the beautiful Matari is joined by two zen poets as she flees from her husband, a samurai lord who is giving chase with intent to murder her. A lyrical and poetic tale of love, honor and morality.
Long Voyage Back (1983), a nautical action-adventure novel, follows a group of people sailing aboard a trimaran, and their struggle for survival as they escape the aftermath of nuclear war.
=== Nonfiction ===
The Book of est (1976) is a narrative account of Werner Erhard's controversial LGAT course personal transformation course known as Erhard Seminar Training or est, which began in 1971. (Erhard insisted on using lower case letters for the acronym.) The reader is put in the place of a participant, in order to vicariously "experience" the training. Erhard authored a foreword to the book. 
The Book of the Die (2000) is “handbook of dice living” intended to help free readers from barriers to an unfulfilled life. It follows the philosophy that people must give up their illusion that a self can control life; they must let go.  A collection of proverbs, essays, cartoons, poems, scenes from movies and more form this guide to creating a more playful and unpredictable life.<!--
The Hairy Balls and the End of Civilization (2019) is a satirical work as if from the point of view of extraterrestrials. The book intends to comment on individuality and the human capacity for creating misery for themselves.-->

===Screenplays===
Though best known as a novelist, Rhinehart has also written nine screenplays: five are based directly on his novels: The Dice Man, The Search for the Dice Man, Whim, Naked Before the World, and White Wind, Black Rider. Two others are direct Dice Man sequels featuring the original character: The Dice Lady (co-written with Peter Forbes), and Last Roll of the Die (co-written with Nick Mead).

==Antecedents and influence==
To date there appears to be a single published scholarly work on the ideas appearing in Cockcroft's The Dice Man, a conference paper from Shanna Robinson of the Institute for Culture and Society at the University of Western Sydney in Australia; in addressing the popular accounts of Dickson on its having the "impact of religious conversion on millions" and the suggestion, again in popular media (by Dickson and Adams), that the dicing theme was, at that time, "enjoying a renaissance",<ref name=TheTimes1/><ref name=guardian3/> Robinson writes:<blockquote>Although acknowledged that there has been no research at this point establishing the veracity of this, a number of other manifestations of dicing lend some credibility to the idea that it enjoys a certain level of popularity.<ref name=RobinsonConfProc></ref></blockquote>
Also, the starting point for David Colton's 2019 PhD thesis, ″Canned Chance, The commodification of aleatory art practice″ is the Dice Man novel. The novel, and the use of dice and other tools for accessing chance are discussed here. See Manchester Metropolitan University, urltoken 
More generally, art exploring the application of chance or randomness in its expression is referred to as aleatoricism,<ref name=LindstedtMiMglossary></ref><ref name="newmusicbox1950"></ref> and at least one academic, Richard Hoadley, a faculty member in Music and Performing Arts at Anglia Ruskin University in the United Kingdom, refers to the writings of Cockcroft/Rhinehart in their teaching on aleatoricism in art.<ref></ref>
== In popular culture ==
===Music===
The Talk Talk song, "Such A Shame", was inspired by The Dice Man.
The At The Gates song, "World of Lies", quotes The Dice Man during it's spoken word lyrics.
=== Television and radio ===
Four seasons of a television travel series called The Diceman were made between 1998 and 2000 by the Discovery Channel. The destinations and activities of the participants were determined by the roll of a die.<ref> urltoken 
UK Channel 4's broadcast of Diceworld (1999, Paul Wilmshurst directing), a 50-minute television documentary about Cockcroft/Rhinehart and some of the people influenced by his novels, led to a resurgence of interest in Cockcroft/Rhinehart's books, and in various related "dicing projects". A further documentary was produced in 2004, a collaboration between Cockcroft/Rhinehart and director Nick Mead, entitled Dice Life: The Random Mind of Luke Rhinehart.
===Theater===
Inspired by The Dice Man and written by Paul Lucas, the play The Dice House premiered in the United Kingdom in 2001, and went on to staging at the Arts Theatre in London's West End in 2004.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
=== Magazines and books ===
Controversially,<ref name = guardian4/> journalist Ben Marshall spent two years from 1998 to 2000 experimenting with dicing, and reporting his experiences in Loaded magazine; Loaded subsequently named Cockcroft/Rhinehart as novelist of the century.<ref name = funtriviaLoaded/>
Murder mystery author Terry Mitchell often uses characters who throw dice to make decisions, and in his own personal life, Mitchell created the "dice road trip", "dicing to eat", and "The Sacred Journey", each of which used dice to make decisions about life decisions.

George Powers Cockcroft (November 15, 1932 – November 6, 2020), widely known by the pen name Luke Rhinehart, was an American novelist, screenwriter, and nonfiction writer,<ref name=guardian2></ref> with at least ten books to his name. He is best known for his 1971 novel The Dice Man, the story of a psychiatrist who experiments with making life decisions based on the roll of a die,<ref name=guardian3></ref> including, near the novel's onset, the rape of his best friend's wife.<ref name=Independent1/>
Cockcroft has described the origin of the idea for this work variously,<ref>For a more complete discussion, see the Wikipedia article, The Dice Man, and references therein.</ref><ref>For an account that describes the origin of the idea in the years between Cockcroft's teens and early twenties in a self-help effort to move him away from shyness and uptightness through risk-taking, in areas such as "what to read, where to go, how to react to people," see Adams, The Guardian, 27 August 2000, op. cit.</ref><ref>For an account that describes the origin of the idea in Cockcroft's college years, in as a way to decide what he and his friends would do together socially, or to decide between slightly mischieveous dates, see Carrère, The Guardian, 7 November 2019, op. cit.</ref><ref>For an account that describes the origin of the idea in Cockcroft at the age of 16 years, likewise in an effort to move him away, first, from procrastination, and later, from shyness, see Gold, The Guardian, 4 March 2017, op. cit.</ref> however, at the time of the publication of this work, "it was not clear whether the book was fiction or autobiography", all the more because its protagonist and author were eponymous, both were described as having the same profession (psychiatry), and elements of the described lives of both (e.g., places of residence, date of birth) were also in common;<ref name=guardian2/><ref name=guardian3/> hence, curiosity over its authorship have persisted since its publication.<ref name=guardian2/><ref name=guardian3/> Emmanuel Carrère, writing for The Guardian, presented a long-form expose on Cockcroft and the relationship between author and legend in 2019, and in following others,<ref name=guardian1/><ref name=guardian3/> established the author Cockcroft as a life-long English professor living "in an old farmhouse with a yard that slopes down to a duck pond", a husband of fifty-years, father of three, and a caregiver to a special needs child.<ref name=guardian2/><ref name=guardian1></ref><ref name=guardian3/>
The Dice Man was critically well received. It quickly became,<ref name=TheTimes1></ref> and remains thought of as a cult classic.<ref name=telegraph1></ref><ref name=Fann2011></ref> It initially sold poorly in the United States, but well in Europe, particularly England, Sweden, Denmark, and Spain.<ref name=guardian1/> Writing in 2017 for The Guardian, Tanya Gold noted that "over the course of 45 years" it was still in print, had become famous, had devoted fans, and had "sold more than 2m copies in multiple languages"<ref name=guardian1/> (e.g., as many as 27 languages and 60 countries have been claimed<ref></ref>). In 1995, the BBC called it "one of the fifty most influential books of the last half of the twentieth century,"<ref></ref> and in 1999, after one of their reporters experimented, controversially, with dicing,<ref name = guardian4></ref> Loaded magazine named it "Novel of the Century".<ref name = funtriviaLoaded></ref> In 2013, Alex Clark of the Telegraph chose it as one of the fifty greatest cult books of the last hundred years.<ref name=telegraph1/>
Cockcroft continued themes—both comical and philosophical—introduced in The Dice Man—in two later novels, Adventures of Wim (1986) and The Search for the Dice Man (1993), as well as in a companion title, The Book of the Die (2000),<ref name=guardian3/> none of which achieved the commercial success of The Dice Man.<ref name=guardian2/> First published in 1971, The Dice Man was twice spoken of in the early 2000s as enjoying a renaissance,<ref name=guardian3/><ref name=Independent1></ref> though a scholar writing on the subject has indicated no formal evidence for such.<ref name=RobinsonConfProc/>
