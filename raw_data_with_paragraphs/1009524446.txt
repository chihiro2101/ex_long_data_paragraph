Jolie Gabor

==Career==
In the 1930s, Jolie opened Crystello, a shop selling crystal and porcelain in Budapest, as well as Jolie's, a handmade-costume-jewelry shop at 4 Kígyó utca in Budapest; she also established another branch of her eponymous shop in Győr.<ref>Zsa Zsa Gábor: my story, written for me by Gerold Frank (World Publishing Co., 1960), pp. 25, 126</ref> Eventually there were five such shops in the Budapest area.<ref name="Art Buchwald 1954 page 148">Art Buchwald, Art Buchwald's Paris (Little, Brown, 1954), p. 148</ref> The firm's jewels also incorporated semiprecious stones and were admired for their old-fashioned settings and workmanship.<ref>Sen Sahir Silan, I Do Not Regret (Vantage Press, 2005), p. 62</ref>
"Just like Bulgari is known in Rome, that's how well-known I was in Budapest", Jolie once stated. "Jolie's did so well that at holiday time they were standing outside in line waiting until somebody goes out from the inside."<ref>Jolie Gabor as told to Cindy Adams, Mason Charter, 1975, p. 126</ref> The rise of Nazism in Germany forced her to curtail her retail business, Gabor recalled, "Everybody told, 'Jolie is crazy to go now to Berlin and Leipzig for jewelry.' I never went again."<ref>Jolie Gabor, as told to Cindy Adams, Mason Charter, 1975, p. 216</ref>
She was forced to close the stores when Hungary was occupied by the Germans, at which time she and other family members fled to Portugal.<ref>Zsa Zsa Gábor: my story, written for me by Gerold Frank (World Publishing Co., 1960), p. 160</ref> They were assisted by Carlos Sampaio Garrido,<ref></ref> Portuguese ambassador to Hungary — Gabor's daughter Magda reportedly was either his aide or his mistress — who provided safe passage to many Hungarian Jews in 1944.<ref></ref><ref>Magda, as aide, cited in Zsa Zsa Gabor: My story, written for me by Gerold Frank (World Publishing Co., 1960), p. 161></ref> An article in Vanity Fair stated in 2001 that it was under Sampaio's guidance that the family ". had been spirited out of the country ."<ref></ref> Her brother, Sebestyén (or Sebastian), also a jeweler, spent part of the war in labor camps, beginning in 1942, until he and their mother, Franceska, were killed in a Budapest bombing raid during World War II.<ref>Information about Sebestyén/Sebastian Tilleman as cited by his daughter, Mrs. Annette Lantos, in Mark Seliger, Leora Kahn, and Rachel Hager's When They Came to Take My Father: Voices of the Holocaust (Arcade Publishing, 1996), p. 96</ref>

Use of the name Johanna on a passenger manifest or passport does not indicate accuracy, necessarily, however. Given the turmoils of wartime Hungary and Portugal, another name might have been used for the sake of camouflage or expediency.</ref> She opened a successful costume jewelry business (called simply Jolie Gabor) in New York City in 1946, with $7,200 borrowed from her daughters.<ref name="Art Buchwald 1954 page 148"/><ref></ref><ref name="San Antonio Light 1950, p. 17">"The Mother of the Gabor Girls", San Antonio Light, February 26, 1950, p. 17</ref> It later moved to 699 Madison Avenue.<ref name="ReferenceA">"Vilmos Gabor Dead", The New York Times, July 11, 1962.</ref> Gabor also established a branch of the firm in Palm Springs, California.

==Publications==
Gabor lent her name to two books:
* Jolie Gabor (Mason Charton, 1975), an as-told-to memoir co-written by Cindy Adams, a newspaper columnist and family friend. Gabor approached Adams to write the book in 1972, even though Gabor fretted that her daughters would dislike the publication. "I am sure it will be a Hungarian tragedy when they read what I have said", she told Adams. "My husband will throw me out and my daughters won't speak to me."<ref>Cindy Adams, "My Jolie Gabor", The Lowell Sun, October 5, 1975</ref> Regarding the book, Gabor told another reporter, "Always a woman can do something. She makes a new hairdo, she makes a new make-up. If the nose isn't good, she fixes it. That is why I write the book. It's never too late for a new look, a new business, a new husband or lover. When we think life is over, it's always ready to begin".<ref name="ReferenceB">Ellie Grossman, "Accent on People: Jolie Gabor", The Times-Standard, March 11, 1976.</ref>
* Jolie Gabor's Family Cookbook (Thomas Y. Crowell, 1962), which was written with Jean and Ted Kaufman, and contains more than 300 traditional Eastern European recipes.
She is also described, in league with her three very famous daughters and her influence upon them, by Darwin Porter in his award-winning Biography * Those Glamorous Gabors, Bombshells from Budapest (Blood Moon Productions, 2013).

When I marry him, darling, he looks younger than me, but now, he looks older".<ref name="ReferenceB"/>
