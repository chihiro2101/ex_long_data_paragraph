Arabic name

==Name structure==
======
The , is the given name, first name, or personal name; e.g. "Ahmad" or "Fatimah". Most Arabic names have meaning as ordinary adjectives and nouns, and are often aspirational of character. For example, Muhammad means 'Praiseworthy' and Ali means 'Exalted' or 'High'.
The syntactic context will generally differentiate the name from the noun/adjective. However Arabic newspapers will occasionally place names in brackets, or quotation marks, to avoid confusion.
Indeed, such is the popularity of the name Muhammad throughout parts of Africa, Arabia, the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia, it is often represented by the abbreviation "Md.", "Mohd.", "Muhd.", or just "M.". In India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, due to its almost ubiquitous use as a first name, a person will often be referred to by their second name:
* Md. Dinar Ibn Raihan
* Mohd. Umair Tanvir
* Md. Osman
======
The nasab is a patronymic or series of patronymics. It indicates the person's heritage by the word ibn "son", colloquially bin) or ibnat ("daughter", also bint, abbreviated bte.).
Ibn Khaldun means "son of Khaldun". Khaldun is the father's personal name or, in this particular case, the name of a remote ancestor.
Several nasab names can follow in a chain to trace a person's ancestry backwards in time, as was important in the tribe based society of the ancient Arabs, both for purposes of identification and for socio-political interactions. Today, however, ibn or bint is no longer used (unless it is the official naming style in a country, region, etc.: Adnen bin Abdallah). The plural is for males and for females. However, or is tribal and encompasses both sexes.
======
The laqab ,&nbsp;pl. alqāb ; agnomen; cognomen; nickname; title, honorific; last name, surname, family name.<ref>dnsi.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Hans-Wehr-English-Arabic-Dctionary-Searchable-Format-.pdf</ref> The laqab is typically descriptive of the person.
An example is the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid (of One Thousand and One Nights fame). is the Arabic version of the name Aaron and means "the Rightly-Guided".
In ancient Arab societies, use of a laqab was common, but today is restricted to the surname, or family name, of birth.
======
The surname could be an everyday name, but is mostly the name of the ancestral tribe, city, country, or any other term used to show relevance. It follows a family through several generations. It most often appears as a demonym, for example , meaning that the person is of Baghdad or descendant of people from Baghdad).
The laqab and nisbah are similar in use, thus, a name rarely contains both.
======
A kunya , kunyah)<ref>Shahpurshah Hormasji Hodivala, Historical Studies in Mug̲h̲al Numismatics, Numismatic Society of India, 1976 (Reprint of the 1923 ed.)</ref> is a teknonym in Arabic names. It is a component of an Arabic name, a type of epithet, in theory referring to the bearer's first-born son or daughter. By extension, it may also have hypothetical or metaphorical references, e.g. in a nom de guerre or a nickname, without literally referring to a son or a daughter.<ref>Pedzisai Mashiri, urltoken "Terms of Address in Shona: A Sociolinguistic Approach", Zambezia, XXVI (i), pp. 93–110, 1999</ref> For example, Sabri Khalil al-Banna was known as Abu Nidal, "father of struggle".
Use of a kunya implies a familiar but respectful setting.
A kunya is expressed by the use of abū (father) or umm (mother) in a idafah, i.e. "father of" or "mother of" as an honorific in place of or alongside given names in the Arab world.
A kunya may also be a nickname expressing the attachment of an individual to a certain thing, as in Abu Bakr, "father of the camel foal", given because of this person's kindness towards camels.
==Common naming practices==
===Arab Muslim===
A common name-form among Arab Muslims is the prefix ("Worshipper", combined with the name of Allah (God), "Worshipper of God"), or with one of the epithets of Allah.
As a mark of deference, is usually not conjoined with the prophets' names.<ref></ref> Nonetheless such names are accepted in some areas. Its use is not exclusive to Muslims and throughout all Arab countries, the name Abdel-Massih, "Servant of Christ", is a common Christian last name.
Converts to Islam may often continue using the native non-Arabic non-Islamic names that are without any polytheistic connotation, or association.
===Arab Christian===
To an extent Arab Christians have names indistinguishable from Muslims, except some explicitly Islamic names, e.g. Muhammad. Some common Christian names are:
* Arabic versions of Christian names (e.g. saints' names: for Saint Peter).
* Names of Greek, Armenian, and Aramaic or Neo-Aramaic origin.
* Use of European names, especially French, Greek and, to a lesser extent, Spanish ones (in Morocco). This has been a relatively recent centuries-long convention for Christian Arabs, especially in the Levant. For example: Émile Eddé, George Habash, Charles Helou, Camille Chamoun.
* Names in honor of Jesus Christ:
: ) / ("Servant of Jesus")
: (masc.) / (fem.) ("Servant of the Messiah")
: Derivations of ("Messiah"): ("Most Anointed"), ("More Anointed"), "Anointed" and "Infant Christ". The root, , means "to anoint" (as in masah) and is cognate to the Hebrew .
==Dynastic or family name==
Some people, especially in the Arabian Peninsula, when descendant of a famous ancestor, start their last name with Āl "family, clan" , like the House of Saud Āl Ṣaʻūd or Al ash-Sheikh ("family of the sheikh"). Āl is distinct from the al- . If a reliably-sourced version of the Arabic spelling includes (as a separate graphic word), then this is a case of the definite article, so (capitalised and followed by a space, not a hyphen) should be used. Ahl, which has a similar meaning, is sometimes used and should be used if the Arabic spelling is .
Dynasty membership alone does necessarily imply that the dynastic is used – e.g. Bashar al-Assad.
* The popular romanization of the Arabized and Hebrew names are written first, then the standardized romanization are written in oblique. Notice that Arabized names may have variants.
* If a literal Arabic translation of a name exists, it will be placed after the final standardized romanization. 
* If an Arabic correlation is ambiguous, (?) will be placed following the name in question.
*: <nowiki>*</nowiki> Yassou' is the Arab Christian name, while ʿĪsā is the Muslim version of the name, as used in the Qur'an. There is debate as to which is the better rendition of the Aramaic Yeshua, because both names are of late origin.
*: <nowiki>**</nowiki> Youhanna is the Arab Christian name of John, while Yahya is the Muslim version of the name, as used in the Qur'an. They have completely different triconsonantal roots: H-N-N ("grace") vs H-Y-Y ("Life"). Specifically, Youhanna may be the Biblical John the Baptist or the apostle. Yahya refers specifically to John the Baptist.
* El, the Hebrew word for strength/might or deity, is usually represented as īl in Arabic, although it carries no meaning in classical and modern Arabic. The only exception is its usage in the archaic Iraqi dialect.
==Indexing==
According to the Chicago Manual of Style, Arabic names are indexed by their surnames. Names may be alphabetized under Abu Abd and ibn, while names are not alphabetized under al- and el- and are instead alphabetized under the following element.<ref>" urltoken Indexes: A Chapter from The Chicago Manual of Style" ( urltoken Archive).

Arabic names have historically been based on a long naming system. Most Arabs have not had given/middle/family names but rather a chain of names. This system remains in use throughout the Arab world.
