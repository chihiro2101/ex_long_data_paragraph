Hedda Gabler

==Characters==
* Hedda Tesman (née Gabler) — The main character, newly married and bored with both her marriage and life, seeking to influence a human fate for the first time. She is the daughter of General Gable. She wants luxury, but has no funds. 
* George (Jørgen) Tesman — Hedda's husband, an academic who is as interested in research and travel as he is enamored with his wife, although blind to Hedda's manipulative ways. Despite George's presumed rivalry with Eilert over Hedda, he remains a congenial and compassionate host and even plans to return Eilert's manuscript after Eilert loses it in a drunken stupor.
* Juliana (Juliane) Tesman — George's loving aunt who has raised him since early childhood. She is also called Aunt Julle in the play, and Aunt Ju-Ju by George. Desperately wants Hedda and her nephew to have a child. In an earlier draft, Ibsen named her Mariane Rising, clearly after his aunt (father's younger half-sister) and godmother Mariane Paus who grew up (with Ibsen's father) on the stately farm Rising near Skien; while she was later renamed Juliane Tesman, her character was modeled after Mariane Paus.<ref>Oskar Mosfjeld, Henrik Ibsen og Skien: En biografisk og litteratur-psykologisk studie (p. 236), Oslo, Gyldendal Norsk Forlag, 1949</ref>
* Thea Elvsted — A younger schoolmate of Hedda and a former acquaintance of George. Nervous and shy, Thea is in an unhappy marriage.
* Judge Brack — An unscrupulous family friend. It is implied that the Judge has a lascivious personality, which he directs towards Hedda.
* Eilert Lövborg (Ejlert Løvborg) — George's former colleague, who now competes with George to achieve publication and a teaching position. Eilert was once in love with Hedda. Destroyed his reputation in society by spending his money on depravity. 
* Bertha (Berte) — A servant of the Tesman's. Wants to please Hedda at all times.
==Plot==
Hedda, the daughter of a general, has just returned to her villa in Kristiania (now Oslo) from her honeymoon. Her husband is George Tesman, a young, aspiring, and reliable academic who continued his research during their honeymoon. It becomes clear in the course of the play that she never loved him, but married him because she thinks her years of youthful abandon are over. 
The reappearance of George's academic rival, Eilert Løvborg, throws their lives into disarray. Eilert, a writer, is also a recovered alcoholic who has wasted his talent until now. Eilert shows signs of rehabilitation and has just published a bestseller in the same field as George. When Hedda and Eilert talk privately together, it becomes apparent that they are former lovers.
The critical success of his recently published work makes Eilert a threat to George, as Eilert is now a competitor for the university professorship George had been counting on. George and Hedda are financially overstretched, and George tells Hedda that he will not be able to finance the regular entertaining or luxurious housekeeping that she had been expecting. Upon meeting Eilert, however, the couple discovers that he has no intention of competing for the professorship, but rather has spent the last few years working on what he considers to be his masterpiece, the "sequel" to his recently published work.
Apparently jealous of Thea's influence over Eilert, Hedda hopes to come between them. Despite his drinking problem, she encourages Eilert to accompany George and his associate, Judge Brack, to a party. George returns home from the party and reveals that he found the complete manuscript (the only copy) of Eilert's great work, which the latter lost while drunk. George is then called away to his aunt's house, leaving the manuscript in Hedda's possession. When Eilert next sees Hedda and Thea, he tells them that he has deliberately destroyed the manuscript. Thea is mortified, and it is revealed that it was the joint work of Eilert and herself. Hedda says nothing to contradict Eilert or to reassure Thea. After Thea has left, Hedda encourages Eilert to commit suicide, giving him a pistol that had belonged to her father. She then burns the manuscript and tells George she has destroyed it to secure their future.
When the news comes that Eilert did indeed kill himself, George and Thea are determined to try to reconstruct his book from Eilert's notes, which Thea has kept. Hedda is shocked to discover from Judge Brack that Eilert's death, in a brothel, was messy and probably accidental; this "ridiculous and vile" death contrasts with the "beautiful and free" one that Hedda had imagined for him. Worse, Brack knows the origins of the pistol. He tells Hedda that if he reveals what he knows, a scandal will likely arise around her. Hedda realizes that this places Brack in a position of power over her. Leaving the others, she goes into her smaller room and shoots herself in the head. The others in the room assume that Hedda is simply firing shots, and they follow the sound to investigate. The play ends with George, Brack, and Thea discovering her body.
==Critical interpretation==
Joseph Wood Krutch makes a connection between Hedda Gabler and Freud, whose first work on psychoanalysis was published almost a decade later. In Krutch's analysis, Gabler is one of the first fully developed neurotic female protagonists of literature.<ref></ref> By that, Krutch means that Hedda is neither logical nor insane in the old sense of being random and unaccountable. Her aims and her motives have a secret personal logic of their own. She gets what she wants, but what she wants is not anything that normal people would acknowledge (at least, not publicly) to be desirable. One of the significant things that such a character implies is the premise that there is a secret, sometimes unconscious, a world of aims and methods — one might almost say a secret system of values — that is often much more important than the rational one. It is regarded as a deep and emotional play, most notably due to Ibsen's portrayal of a sort of anti-character.<ref></ref> 
Ibsen was interested in the then-embryonic science of mental illness and had a poor understanding of it by present-day standards. His Ghosts is another example of this. Examples of the troubled 19th-century female might include oppressed, but "normal", willful characters; women in abusive or loveless relationships; and those with some type of organic brain disease. Ibsen is content to leave such explanations unsettled. Bernard Paris interprets Gabler's actions as stemming from her "need for freedom which is as compensatory as her craving for power. her desire to shape a man's destiny."<ref>Paris, Bernard. Imagined Human Beings: A Psychological Approach to Character and Conflict in Literature, New York University Press: New York City, 1997, p. 59.</ref>
==Productions==
The play was performed in Munich at the Cuvilliés Theatre on 31 January 1891, with Clara Heese as Hedda, though Ibsen was said to be displeased with the declamatory style of her performance. Ibsen's work had an international following so that translations and productions in various countries appeared very soon after the publication in Copenhagen and the premiere in Munich. In February 1891 there were two productions: Berlin and Copenhagen.<ref>Marker, Frederick J. Marker, Lise-Lone. Ibsen’s Lively Art: A Performance Study of the Major Plays.

Hedda Gabler is a play written by Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. The world premiere was staged on 31 January 1891 at the Residenztheater in Munich. Ibsen himself was in attendance, although he remained backstage.<ref>Meyer, Michael Leverson, editor and introduction. Ibsen, Henrik. The Wild Duck and Hedda Gabler. W. W. Norton & Company (1997) . page 7.</ref> The play has been canonized as a masterpiece within the genres of literary realism, nineteenth century theatre, and world drama.<ref name="autogenerated26">Bunin, Ivan.

Ibsen’s Drama: Author to Audience. University of Minnesota Press (1979) . page 142</ref> Ibsen mainly wrote realistic plays until his forays into modern drama. Hedda Gabler is a captivating and well-known play from the 1890s that dramatizes the experiences of the title character, Hedda, the daughter of a general, who is trapped in a marriage and a house that she does not want. Overall, the title character for Hedda Gabler is considered one of the great dramatic roles in theater.<ref></ref> The year following its publication, the play received negative feedback and reviews. Hedda Gabler has been described as a female variation of Hamlet.<ref></ref> 
Hedda's married name is Hedda Tesman; Gabler is her maiden name. On the subject of the title, Ibsen wrote: "My intention in giving it this name was to indicate that Hedda as a personality is to be regarded rather as her father's daughter than her husband's wife."<ref></ref>
