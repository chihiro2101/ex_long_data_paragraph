Baytown, Texas

=== County, state and federal services ===
The United States Postal Service operates the Baytown Main Post Office at 601 West Baker Road and the Baytown Post Office "Station A" at 3508 Market Street. The "Station A" designation is a leftover from Baytown's pre-consolidation days. Prior to consolidation in 1948 each of the tri-cities, (Baytown, Pelly, and Goose Creek), had their own post office. After 1948 when the tri-cities consolidated under the name Baytown, Goose Creek's post office became the main post office but they still needed a post office to service the rest of town so the Old Baytown Post Office became "Station A".<ref>" urltoken Post Office Location – BAYTOWN."
