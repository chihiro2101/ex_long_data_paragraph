==Appearances==
===Dragon Ball Z===
Vegeta is introduced as the proud prince of the race and the first major antagonist of the Dragon Ball Z series. He travels to Earth with his partner Nappa to use the Dragon Balls to wish for immortality.<ref></ref> Nappa easily fights off Earth's heroes and kills Tenshinhan, Chaozu, and Piccolo in the process. Goku then arrives after completing his training with Kaiō-sama. Goku easily defeats Nappa who is then killed by Vegeta, for the shame of being defeated by a low class Saiyan such as Goku. Vegeta fights and beats Goku in a very close fight after resorting to his Ozaru form, but is unable to beat the rest of the heroes due to his sustained injuries. Exhausted and being consistently harassed by Gohan, Krillin and Yajirobe, he barely escapes with his life and is humiliated by the fact that Goku pleaded with Krillin to spare his life.<ref></ref> Vegeta travels to planet Namek in an attempt to wish for immortality using that planet's Dragon Balls, cutting the tyrant Frieza off from making the same wish in the process.<ref></ref> Upon arrival, Vegeta manages to kill many of Frieza's henchmen and also mercilessly destroys a whole defenseless Namekian village for their Dragon Ball. Later on Vegeta is forced to team up with Gohan, Goku, Piccolo, and Krillin so they can fight off Frieza. He also kills most members of the Ginyu Force. Ultimately, he is defeated and subsequently killed by Frieza while asking Goku to avenge him and all the other Saiyans. Vegeta is unintentionally revived with a wish from the Dragon Balls from Earth.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
After Frieza's final defeat, Vegeta chooses to stay on Earth and has a son named Trunks with Bulma.<ref></ref><ref name="trunksmanga"></ref><ref name="trunksanime"></ref><ref name="trunksanime2"></ref> Three years later, Vegeta finally becomes a Super Saiyan and easily destroys Android 19, sent by Dr. Gero to kill Goku.<ref></ref> However, even as a Super Saiyan, he is easily defeated by Android 18. Afterwards, Vegeta ascends beyond the Super Saiyan level while training with Trunks from an alternate dimension in the and pummels the artificial life form Cell, who has absorbed Android 17. Vegeta's overconfidence leads him to allow Cell to absorb Android 18, upon which Cell achieves his "perfect" form. After Vegeta fails to defeat Perfect Cell, he is forced to participate in Cell's martial arts tournament known as the Cell Games, in which he makes a crucial intervention so Gohan can overpower and defeat Cell in his perfect form.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
Seven years later, Vegeta allows himself to be consumed by Babidi's evil power for his own desire to become powerful enough to fight and defeat Goku. He then goes on an indiscriminate killing spree to provoke Goku to fight him.<ref name="ch262"></ref> However, when the monster Majin Buu is revived as a result of the energy released from their fight, Vegeta knocks out Goku from behind after deceiving Goku by feigning a truce. Vegeta then faces Majin Buu alone and ends up sacrificing himself in an attempt to defeat Buu, dedicating his sacrifice to Bulma, Trunks, and also Goku.<ref></ref> With all other fighters dead or absorbed, Vegeta is allowed to recover his body and returns to Earth to help Goku, the last warrior remaining, against the threat of Buu. He reluctantly combines bodies with Goku using the Potara earrings, to create the fused warrior Vegito, who completely overwhelms Buu with his strength.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Eventually, Vegito allows himself to be absorbed into Buu's body to free the other heroes absorbed by Buu, but this leads to the splitting of the fusion.<ref></ref> Goku and Vegeta manage to free their allies who have been absorbed by Buu, causing him to undergo a new transformation, which results in his return to his original Kid Boo form. On the Kaiō-shin's planet, Vegeta battles Buu again to buy time for Goku to gather energy for the Genki Dama, which he uses to defeat Majin Buu once and for all. It is during this fight that Vegeta finally admits Goku as both his superior and friend.<ref></ref>
