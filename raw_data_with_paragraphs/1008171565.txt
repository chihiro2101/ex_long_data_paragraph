Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester

==Early life==
Alice Christabel was born in Montagu House, Whitehall, London, on Christmas Day 1901 as the third daughter and fifth child of John Montagu Douglas Scott, 7th Duke of Buccleuch, and his wife, the former Lady Margaret Alice "Molly" Bridgeman, daughter of the 4th Earl of Bradford.<ref name="earlylife"></ref> Her brothers Walter and William and her nephew John were all Conservative MPs. Her first cousin, Marian Montagu Douglas Scott, was the paternal grandmother of Sarah, Duchess of York, former wife of Alice's great-nephew, Prince Andrew, Duke of York.
She was a descendant, in an unbroken male line, of Charles II through his eldest but illegitimate son, James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, himself a major political figure during the years leading up to the Glorious Revolution. As she was born on Christmas Day, she was given the middle name of Christabel.<ref name="memoirs1983"></ref>
Alice spent much of her childhood travelling "between splendid houses":<ref name="Independent-Alice" /> Boughton House in Northamptonshire, Drumlanrig Castle in Dumfries and Galloway, and Bowhill, Scottish Borders.<ref name="memoirs1983" /> Eildon Hall, in Melrose, Scottish Borders, was more or less home base.<ref name="telegraphobituary"></ref><ref name="Tel-Bio"></ref>
An experience of nearly drowning at the age of 14 awoke her to a keen sense of making the most of every day.<ref name="memoirs1983" /> Caught in a current in the Solway Firth, she was convinced that she was going to die and she prayed to God, begging for a miracle to save her life in exchange for her devoting herself to public service:
She attended the independent Malvern St James, in West Malvern, Worcestershire, and later travelled to France, Kenya and India.<ref name="memoirs1983" /> After school in West Malvern, she spent a year in Paris "before returning home to be presented at Court in 1920".<ref name="officialbio"></ref> Alice enjoyed skiing, horse-riding and hunting and was also an accomplished watercolourist.<ref></ref><ref name="BBC-Obituary"></ref><ref name="Tel-Bio"/> A painting by her, done near Archers Post in Kenya, is today part of the Royal Collection.<ref></ref> In Kenya, where she stayed for over a year, from about 1929–1931, she stayed in the area typical of the so-called Happy Valley set and encountered many of the personalities of said clique, including Evelyn Waugh.<ref name="memoirs1983" /><ref name="Independent-Alice" />
==Marriage==
In 1935, Alice returned to the United Kingdom when she learned that her father's health had been deteriorating.<ref name="Tel-Bio"/> In August 1935, Lady Alice became engaged to Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester.<ref name="Memories" /> Henry proposed to Alice with a square sapphire ring.<ref></ref> They were married in a private ceremony, in the Private Chapel, Buckingham Palace, on 6 November of that year.<ref name="Memories">HRH Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, Memories of Ninety Years, London: Collins & Brown Ltd., 1991, p. 138.</ref> A much more elaborate wedding was originally planned for Westminster Abbey; but after the Duke of Buccleuch died of cancer on 19 October 1935, and in consideration of the King's own failing health, it was decided that the wedding should be scaled down to a more private setting.<ref name="Memories" />
The Duchess's bridesmaids were her sister, the Lady Angela Montagu-Douglas-Scott; her nieces Clare Phipps, Lady Elizabeth Montagu-Douglas-Scott, and Anne Hawkins; her husband's nieces Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret of York; her cousin Moyra Montagu-Douglas-Scott; and her husband's cousin Lady Mary Whitley. Alice wore a blush-hued wedding gown, the only British royal bride to do so. Her gown was designed by Norman Hartnell, who later designed the wedding dress of Princess Elizabeth, the future queen. The dress was "of modest simplicity, with long, narrow sleeves and a high neckline draped into a nosegay of artificial orange-blossom".<ref name="Vogue-Dress"></ref> The veil was made from "a drifting cloud of crisp modern tulle".<ref name="Vogue-Dress"/>
On her way to the private chapel at Buckingham Palace, Alice wore "an ermine blanket stole" due to the cold weather.<ref name="Vogue-Dress"/> Although the day was cold and wet, a crowd estimated to be over one million people lined the streets from the Palace to the railway station to see the couple off on their honeymoon. She was often referred to as the "Winter Princess" from then on.<ref name="telegraphobituary" />

==Legacy==
Hugo Vickers called Princess Alice "a very private person who was not widely known to the general public" despite being the third highest ranking lady in the royal family at the time of her marriage. 
It was well known she disliked large parties. Peter Townsend said of her: "She possessed classic, serene good looks and sincerity shone from her mild face. But she was painfully shy, so that conversation with her was sometimes halting and unrewarding, for you felt that she had so much more to say, but could not bring herself to say it."<ref></ref> Alice herself wrote in her autobiography: "I was very shy and rather plump, . I made a miserable debut at a dance at Windsor for Princess Mary's birthday, uncomfortably squeezed into a white satin frock."<ref name="Tel-Bio"/>
Although generally a woman of few and soft-spoken words, Princess Alice was known for her dry humour.<ref name="Independent-Alice" /> Soon after her marriage, when the couple moved to York House, they were warned that the drawing-room floor would not stand the weight of more than twenty people "so we made a party list" recalled the Duchess many years later "of the twenty-one people whom we disliked most".<ref name="aronson2014"></ref>
The Queen Mother said of Princess Alice after her son's death in an aircrash in 1972: "The tragic accident was a great shock to all the family, but I feel desperately for his dear little mother. She has the courage of a lion, and has suffered so many cruel blows in the past few years.".<ref>Vickers, p. 406</ref> Alice herself later admitted that following her son's death "I was completely stunned and have never quite been the same since."<ref name="Tel-Bio2"/>

As a widow she requested permission from her niece, the Queen, to use the title and style HRH Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester instead of adopting HRH The Dowager Duchess of Gloucester.
