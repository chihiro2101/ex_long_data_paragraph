Harlech Castle

===15th–17th centuries===
In 1400 a revolt broke out in North Wales against English rule, led by Owain Glyndŵr.<ref name=Taylor2007P10></ref> By 1403 only a handful of castles, including Harlech, still stood against the rebels, but the castle was under-equipped and under-staffed to withstand a siege, the garrison having just three shields, eight helmets, six lances, ten pairs of gloves, and four guns.<ref>; </ref> At the end of 1404, the castle fell to Glyndŵr.<ref name=Taylor2007P10/> Harlech became his residence, family home and military headquarters for four years; he held his second parliament in Harlech in August 1405.<ref></ref> In 1408 English forces under the command of the future Henry V placed Harlech and its commander, Edmund Mortimer, under siege, conducting a bombardment with cannon, probably destroying the south and east parts of the outer walls.<ref name=Taylor2007P10/> When this failed to take the castle, Henry left John Talbot in charge of the siege and moved on to deal with Aberystwyth Castle.<ref></ref> Supplies finally ran short, Mortimer and many of his men died of exhaustion, and Harlech fell in February 1409.<ref>; </ref>
In the 15th century, Harlech was involved in the series of civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses that broke out between the rival factions of the House of Lancaster and York. In 1460, following the Battle of Northampton, Queen Margaret of Anjou fled to the castle and between 1461–68 it was held by her Lancastrian supporters, under the command of Dafydd ap Ieuan, against the Yorkist Edward IV.<ref name=Taylor2007P11></ref> Thanks to its natural defences and the supply route by sea, Harlech held out and as other fortresses fell, eventually became the last major stronghold still under Lancastrian control.<ref name=Hicks2012P179></ref> The castle became a base for their operations across the region: there were planned operations in 1464, Sir Richard Tunstall mounted attacks from Harlech in 1466 and Jasper Tudor landed there with French reinforcements in 1468, before then raiding the town of Denbigh.<ref name=Hicks2012P179/> Tudor's arrival caused Edward IV to order William Herbert to mobilise an army, possibly up to 10,000 strong, to finally seize the castle.<ref>; </ref> After a month's siege, the small garrison surrendered on 14 August.<ref name=Taylor2007P11/> This siege is credited with inspiring the song Men of Harlech.<ref>; </ref>
The English Civil War broke out in 1642 between the Royalist supporters of Charles I and the Roundheads. Harlech apparently had not been repaired following the 1468 siege, and had become completely dilapidated, with the exception of the gatehouse, which was used for the local assizes.<ref></ref> In 1644 Prince Rupert appointed a local Royalist, Colonel William Owen, as the castle's constable, and Owen was entrusted with repairing the fortifications.<ref></ref> A long siege ensued from June 1646 until 15 March 1647, when the garrison of 44 men surrendered to Major-General Thomas Mytton.<ref name=Taylor2007P13></ref> The castle was the last mainland royal fortress to surrender in the war, and the date marked the end of the first phase of the war.<ref name=Taylor2007P13/> The castle was no longer required for the security of North Wales and, to prevent any further use by the Royalists, Parliament ordered its slighting, or destruction.<ref name=Taylor2007P13/> The orders were only partially carried out, however, and the gatehouse staircases were destroyed and the castle rendered generally unusable, but it was not totally demolished.<ref>; </ref> Stone from the castle was reused to build houses in the local town.<ref name=Lott2010P116></ref>
===18th–21st centuries===
In the late-18th and 19th centuries, the picturesque ruins of Harlech began to attract visits from prominent artists, including John Cotman, Henry Gastineau, Paul Sandby, J. M. W. Turner and John Varley.<ref></ref> In 1914 it was transferred from the Merioneth Crown Estate to the control of the Office of Works, who commenced a major restoration project after the end of World War I.<ref name=Taylor2007P14></ref> In 1969 the castle was transferred to the Welsh Office and then to Cadw, who manage the property in the 21st century as a tourist attraction.<ref name=Taylor2007P14/> Harlech was declared part of the Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd World Heritage site in 1986, UNESCO considering Harlech one of "the finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe".<ref>; </ref>
==Architecture==
Harlech Castle rests upon part of the Rhinogydd, a spur of rock almost high; the land falls away sharply on the north and west, and a ditch cut into the rock protects the remaining approaches to the castle.<ref name=Taylor2007P17></ref> The castle has a Concentric castle, with one line of defences enclosed by another, forming an inner and outer ward; the outer wall was originally somewhat taller than today.<ref></ref> Harlech is built from local grey-green sandstone, with large, regular blocks used for the towers and irregular material, possibly taken from the ditch, used for the walls.<ref name=Lott2010P116/> A softer yellow sandstone is used for the decorative work in the castle, possibly quarried from around Egryn Abbey near Barmouth.<ref name=Lott2010P116/>
The main entrance to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge.<ref></ref> A water gate overlooks a protected stairway of 127 steps that runs down to the foot of the cliffs.<ref></ref> In the 13th century, the sea came up close to the stairway, allowing resupply by sea, but today the sea has retreated significantly, making it more difficult to envisage the concept in its original setting.<ref name=Taylor2007P17/>
The gatehouse follows the design, sometimes termed the Tonbridge-style, that became popular during the 13th century, with two massive "D-shaped" defensive towers flanking the entrance.<ref>; </ref> The passage into the castle was guarded by three portcullises and at least two heavy doors.<ref name=Taylor2007P21/> The gatehouse has two upper floors, broken up into various rooms.<ref></ref> Each floor has three large windows overlooking the inner ward; the second floor has two additional grand windows on the sides of the gatehouse; the gatehouse was fitted with fireplaces and would originally have had prominent chimneys.<ref></ref> The use of these rooms has been the subject of academic debate: historian Arnold Taylor argued that the first floor of the gatehouse was used by the constable as living accommodation, with the second floor used by senior visitors; Jeremy Ashbee has since challenged this interpretation, suggesting the high status accommodation may instead have been in the inner ward, and the gatehouse used for other purposes.<ref>; </ref>
The inner ward is guarded by four large circular towers. Over time these acquired various names: in 1343, clockwise from the north-east, they were called Le Prisontour, Turris Ultra Gardinium, Le Wedercoktour and Le Chapeltour, but by 1564 they had been renamed the Debtors', Mortimer, Bronwen and Armourer's Towers respectively.<ref></ref> Le Prisontour incorporated a dungeon and the Le Chapeltour may have contained an artillery workshop in the 16th century.<ref></ref> Several ranges of buildings were built around the inner ward, including a chapel, kitchen, service buildings, a granary and a great hall.<ref></ref> The battlements may originally have been built with triple finials in a similar fashion to Conwy, although little remains of these in the modern era.<ref name=Taylor2007P29></ref>
The architecture of Harlech has close links to that found in the kingdom of Savoy in the same period.<ref name=Taylor2007P29/> These include semi-circular door arches, window styles, corbelled towers and positioning of putlog holes, and are usually ascribed to the influence of the Savoy architect Master James.<ref></ref> The links between the Harlech and Savoy are not straightforward, however, as in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built after James had left the region.<ref name=Coldstream2010P43></ref> The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider role played by Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the Harlech project.<ref name=Coldstream2010P43/>

Harlech was established with a garrison of 36 men: a constable, 30 men, including 10 crossbowmen, a chaplain, a smith, carpenter and stonemason, and Master James was rewarded by being made the constable of Harlech from 1290–93.<ref></ref> In 1294, Madog ap Llywelyn began an uprising against English rule that spread quickly through Wales. Several English-held towns were razed and Harlech, along with Criccieth Castle and Aberystwyth Castle, were besieged that winter.<ref name=Taylor2007P9></ref> Fresh supplies were sent from Ireland by sea, arriving via Harlech's water gate, and the uprising was quashed.<ref name=Taylor2007P9/> In the aftermath of the revolt, additional defences were built around the route down to the sea.<ref name=Taylor2007P9/> Further work was undertaken between 1323–24, following the Despenser War; Edward II was threatened in the region by the Mortimer Marcher Lord family, and ordered his sheriff, Sir Gruffudd Llwyd, to extend the defences leading up to the gatehouse with additional towers.<ref></ref>
