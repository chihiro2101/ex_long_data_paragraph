Kingsnake

==Etymology==
Lampropeltis includes the Greek words for "shiny shield":<ref></ref> ("shiny") + ("peltē") + (a Latin suffix).
The name is given to them in reference to their smooth, enamel-like dorsal scales.<ref></ref>
Their common name of "kingsnake" derives from their habit of eating other snakes (such as rattlesnakes)
==Range and morphology==
Kingsnake species inhabit the Americas from southeastern Canada to southern Ecuador. Several species vary widely in size and coloration. Adult scarlet kingsnakes are typically 40 to 50&nbsp;cm (16 to 20 in) in length, while the common kingsnake can grow to 1.8&nbsp;m (6&nbsp;ft). Some kingsnakes are colored in muted browns to black, while others are brightly marked in white, reds, yellows, grays, and lavenders that form rings, longitudinal stripes, speckles, and saddle-shaped bands.<ref name=Peterson></ref>
==Behavior and diet==
Kingsnakes use constriction to kill their prey and tend to be opportunistic in their diet; they eat other snakes (ophiophagy), including venomous snakes. Kingsnakes also eat lizards, rodents, birds, and eggs.<ref name="Conant1975">Conant, R. (1975). A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition. Houghton Mifflin. Boston. 429 pp. <br> (paperback). (Genus Lampropeltis, p. 201.)</ref> The common kingsnake is known to be immune to the venom of other snakes and does eat rattlesnakes, but it is not necessarily immune to the venom of snakes from different localities.<ref name="Conant1975"/> 
The "king" in the name (as with the king cobra) refers to its preying on other snakes.<ref></ref>
Kingsnakes such as the California kingsnake can exert twice as much constriction force relative to body size as rat snakes and pythons. Scientists believe such strong coils may be an adaptation to snake and other reptile prey, which can sustain lower blood-oxygen levels before asphyxiating.<ref></ref>
==Description==
Most kingsnakes have quite vibrant patterns on their skins. Some species, such as the scarlet kingsnake, Mexican milk snake, and red milk snake, have coloration and patterning that can cause them to be confused with the highly venomous coral snakes.
One of the mnemonic rhymes to help people distinguish between coral snakes and their nonvenomous lookalikes in the United States is "red on black, a friend of Jack; red on yellow, kill a fellow". Other variations include "red on yellow kill a fellow, red on black venom lack",<ref> urltoken Life's Better Outdoors, South Carolina Department of natural resources (see FAQ's. -- "are there any visual clues"). Retrieved July 15, 2015</ref><ref>Medical-Surgical Nursing: Patient-Centered Collaborative Care&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Donna D. Ignatavicius, M. Linda Workman&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(pages 141-142)</ref> and referencing the order of traffic lights "yellow, red, stop!" All these mnemonics apply only to the three species of coral snakes native to the southern United States: Micrurus fulvius (the eastern or common coral snake), Micrurus tener (the Texas coral snake), and Micruroides euryxanthus (the Arizona coral snake). Coral snakes found in other parts of the world can have distinctly different patterns, have red bands touching black bands, have only pink and blue bands, or have no bands at all.
==Taxonomy==
Taxonomic reclassification of the kingsnakes is an ongoing process and different sources often disagree, one source granting full species status to a group of these snakes that another source considers a subspecies group. In the case of Lampropeltis catalinensis, for example, only a single specimen exists, so classification is not necessarily finite. In addition, hybridization between species with overlapping geographic ranges is not uncommon, confusing taxonomists further.
==Predators==
Kingsnakes are often preyed upon by large vertebrates, such as Bird of prey. Tarantulas also sometimes prey on them.<ref> urltoken

Additionally, Pyron and Burbrink have argued that the short-tailed snake (Stilosoma extenuatum) (Brown, 1890) should be included with Lampropeltis.<ref>Pyron, R. Alexander; Frank T. Burbrink. (2009).

Kingsnakes are colubrid New World Constriction, members of the genus Lampropeltis, which includes milk snakes and four other species. Among these, about 45 subspecies are recognized. They are non-venomous snakes and are ophiophagy in diet.
