The Birthday Party (band)

===Post-breakup, legacy and influence===
Several groups rose from The Birthday Party's ashes: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds (featuring Cave, Harvey, Adamson, Bargeld and briefly Pew), Crime and the City Solution (featuring Harvey and Howard, later just Harvey) and These Immortal Souls (featuring Howard).
Pew died from injuries caused by an epileptic seizure in 1986.
On 1 September 1992, there was a brief Birthday Party reunion as Rowland S. Howard joined Nick Cave and Mick Harvey on stage at a Bad Seeds NME charity show at the Town and Country Club in London to play "Wild World", "Dead Joe" and "Nick the Stripper".
Due in part to their legendary status and to the continuing success of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, The Birthday Party's back catalogue has been re-released on CD several times. Mick Harvey has overseen releases of rare or previously unissued recordings (Live and John Peel CDs).
The Birthday Party's initial impact was on the gothic rock genre. According to New Musical Express, "The Party have been indirectly held responsible for the rise of a visceral new hardcore, ranging from The Sex Gang Children, through Danse Macabre to March Violets."<ref name="New Musical Express 1982. p. 141, 143">New Musical Express, 25 December 1982. Cited in Jennifer Park, "Melancholy and the Macabre: Gothic Rock and Fashion," Gothic: Dark Glamour by Valerie Steele and Jennifer Park, p. 141, 143.</ref> Rock acts that have cited The Birthday Party as an influence include My Bloody Valentine<ref> urltoken Guitar World, April 1993 by Alan Di Perna Kevin Shields: "The Birthday Party were also my favorite band at that time. They're pretty much why I formed a band. Them and the Cramps."</ref> and LCD Soundsystem.<ref> urltoken Thrasher Magazine, Sept, 2005 by Sarah Pulver James Murphy: « My first album: I got some birthday money, went to the record store and bought Siouxsie and the Banshees Join Hands, The Fall Grotesque, and The Birthday Party Nick the Stripper, all in one day. And all three of those records are three of my favorite things I've ever heard. »</ref> In 2006, American label Three One G released Release The Bats: The Birthday Party As Heard Through The Meat Grinder Of Three One G, a compilation featuring covers by various bands, including Daughters, Melt-Banana and Cattle Decapitation.
In October 2007, Cave alone was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. During his acceptance speech, Cave took it upon himself to 'induct' the Australian members of the Bad Seeds (including Harvey), plus Howard and Pew from The Birthday Party.
Rowland S. Howard died on 30 December 2009 of liver cancer.<ref></ref> In 2012 Howard's early songs were played live as a tribute in Melbourne: a four-piece band played consisting of Harvey, Calvert, Ron Rude and Rowland Howard's sister Angela.<ref></ref>

The Mutiny EP contained lyrics evoking blasphemy, words which were as dark as the gothic poems of Lautréamont.<ref name=rey/> The title track portrayed a dirty heaven with rats and trash.<ref name=rey/>
In 1982 a spin-off group with Lydia Lunch, Honeymoon in Red, recorded an album which was eventually released in 1987. Harvey and Cave were reportedly so unhappy with the mixing and overdubbing done after their involvement that they requested their names be withheld from its liner notes. Howard and Pew apparently had no objections to being credited by name.
A tour in January 1983 found the group return to a five-piece, with Laughing Clowns playing drums and Harvey returning to second guitar. Wegener did not remain with the group, however, and they returned to a four-piece soon after. Later that year, Blixa Bargeld from the German group Einstürzende Neubauten recorded a guitar part in the studio on the track "Mutiny in Heaven". Tension between Cave and Howard soon came to a head, but it was Harvey who first left the group – their final tour saw Des Hefner on drums. The Birthday Party played their final show at the Crystal Ballroom in St Kilda on 9 June 1983 and disbanded not long after, due in part to the split between Cave and Howard, as well as work and drug-related exhaustion.<ref name="Larkin"></ref>
