Whataburger

==History==
===Early years===
In 1950, Harmon Dobson and Paul Burton were looking to open a hamburger restaurant. Dobson's goal was to "make a better burger that took two hands to hold and tasted so good that when you took a bite you would say 'What a burger!'" In June 1950, Dobson was granted the Whataburger trademark. In August of that year they opened their first location on Ayers Street in Corpus Christi, Texas, across from Del Mar College.<ref name="tsha"/><ref></ref> The store sold burgers for 25 cents, and also sold drinks and chips.<ref name="tsha"></ref>
In 1951, Burton and Dobson ended their partnership after arguments concerning Dobson's price raise of the burger from 25 to 30 cents. Burton settled with owning the Whataburger franchises in San Antonio, Texas. Months later, prices for burgers were raised to 35 cents.<ref name="tsha"/> In 1952, Dobson opened a location in Kingsville, Texas, the first store outside of Corpus Christi. In 1953, Joe Andrews, Sr. became the first non-founder franchise owner with a location in Alice, Texas. In 1959, the first Whataburger restaurant outside Texas opened in Pensacola, Florida.<ref name="ourstory"></ref>
===1960s and 1970s===
By 1960, there were stores operating across Texas, Florida, and Tennessee.<ref name="ourstory"/> Inspired by his love for flying, Dobson designed the orange and white striped A-frame store in Odessa, Texas, in 1961.<ref name="tsha"/><ref name="landmark"/>

On April 11, 1967, Dobson and an associate died in an airplane crash, and Dobson's widow, Grace, took control of the business. In 1969, Grace became chairman of the board.<ref name="tsha"/>
In 1971, the company opened its first drive-through store, and in 1972, it opened its 100th store. In 1974, the A-frame design was changed to a "Modern A-Frame" to accommodate drive-thrus and larger dining rooms.

===2000–present===
On August 8, 2000, Whataburger celebrated its 50th anniversary with 575 operating stores. In 2001, during the 77th Texas Legislative Session, a bill was passed proclaiming Whataburger to be a Texas Treasure.<ref></ref> 
In 2003, it hired Austin-based advertising firm McGarrah Jessee,<ref></ref> which created an advertising campaign featuring the gravelly voice of Ohio actor William Bassett.<ref name="pride"/> In 2007, the company achieved 700 stores in ten states with annual revenue of $1 billion.<ref name="growing"/>

==Corporate affairs==
===Headquarters and offices===
In 2009 the company moved from its long time base in Corpus Christi to a new headquarters at 300 Concord Plaza Drive, a building in San Antonio.<ref name=BizJournalWhatabuy1></ref><ref></ref> 
Previously the corporate headquarters were in Corpus Christi. With the regional offices' in Corpus Christi, Houston, Irving, and Phoenix.<ref></ref> 
After Hurricane Ike hit the Texas Coast in 2008, the company began considering moving its headquarters from Corpus Christi.<ref></ref> On Friday November 21, 2008, the company announced it was permanently moving the headquarters to San Antonio, and that the current Corpus Christi office would remain open indefinitely to help ease the transition.<ref name=Welch></ref> The company chose to permanently relocate to San Antonio because of a larger talent pool for potential employees, increased protection from hurricanes, and office space that is considered to be cost-efficient.<ref name=BizJournalWhatabuy1/><ref name=BizJournalWhatabuy2></ref>
By March 2009 the company purchased the Concord Plaza development from HDG Mansur. According to Whataburger officials, the company chose Concord Plaza due to proximity to neighborhoods and schools attractive to employees and proximity to San Antonio International Airport. Tesoro, which leased space in the development, was moving to another facility at the time Whataburger bought the building.<ref name=BizJournalWhatabuy1/> The company planned to move 250 jobs in the corporate sector to San Antonio,<ref name=BizJournalWhatabuy1/> with over 60% of the employees coming from Corpus Christi and the remainder hired locally.<ref name=BizJournalWhatabuy2/>
==What-A-Burger and similar stores==
Whataburger is sometimes confused with the What-A-Burger (hyphenated) chain of family-operated restaurants in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The first What-A-Burger store opened in 1950 by entrepreneur Jack Branch near Newport News, Virginia, at Newport News Circle (intersection of Jefferson Avenue and U.S. Route 258) in the former Warwick County. Branch's first location preceded the first Texas Whataburger restaurant slightly; the move took place after a modernization project involving the traffic circle. What-A-Burger and Whataburger were unaware of each other's existence several states apart until around 1970, when there was some correspondence. However, no legal actions took place until 2002–2003, when both companies sued each other over the alleged trademark infringement.<ref></ref> The Court of Appeals, in 2004, eventually decided the Texas Whataburger had a legitimate trademark; but the Virginia chain did not harm the much larger Texas-based chain in any way or any reasonable public confusion: "There is no evidence — nor can we imagine any — that consumers are currently likely to be confused about whether the burgers served by Virginia W-A-B come from Texas or Virginia."<ref></ref>
A second restaurant chain based in North Carolina, named What-A-Burger Drive-In, owned by Eb and Michael Bost, was not a party to the lawsuit, but under case law procedures, it would also retain its name. It visibly numbered their stores starting from #1 in Kannapolis, North Carolina, to #15 in Concord, North Carolina, six of which remain in operation .<ref name="driveins"></ref><ref name="north_carolina"></ref>
==Sponsorships==
Whataburger has sponsored a variety of music festivals.<ref></ref> The company has also sponsored sports through the Whataburger Sports Complex in Kilgore, Texas,<ref></ref> the Arizona Soccer Association,<ref></ref> and David Starr Racing,<ref></ref> among others.
