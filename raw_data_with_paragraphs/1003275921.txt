====About translations====
About translating David Rokeah from Hebrew, Celan wrote: "David Rokeah was here for two days, I have translated two poems for him, mediocre stuff, and given him comments on other German translation, suggested improvements . I was glad, probably in the wrong place, to be able to decipher and translate a Hebrew text."<ref>The Correspondence of Paul Celan & Ilana Shmueli, The Sheep Meadow Press, New York, Letter 99, pp. 103–104</ref>
