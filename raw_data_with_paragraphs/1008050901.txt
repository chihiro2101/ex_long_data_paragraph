==Philosophy==
===Ecology===
Starck develops alternative materials to create in a more ecological way. In 2010 he took an interest in sorting waste in companies and designed Elise, an ecological trash can available in six colors, for six different types of waste.
Zartan, created for Magis in 2010, is a chair entirely made from natural material as bamboo, linen and hemp fiber, a non-toxic and biodegradable alternative to replace plastic.<ref></ref> This made it eco friendly and very good for the environment as he wasnt using plastic .
In 2012, Starck released Broom for Emeco, an anti-waste chair made of materials collected in lumber and plastic plants factories.<ref></ref>
Starck continues his reflection on structure and matter with the 7 chairs of the Generic Collection for Kartell in 2015. The evolution of universal seats as chairs found in cafes, offices, administrations that are part of the collective memory. In 2016, he introduces wood into Kartell's catalog with the Smart Wood collection by transforming wood residues into material able to be molded like plastic.
Starck released Cassina Croque la pomme in 2019, a furniture collection for Cassina, entirely made from a vegan fabric, with apple leather.<ref></ref>
===Democratic design===
Starck's concept of democratic design led him to focus on mass-produced consumer goods rather than one-off pieces, seeking ways to reduce cost and improve quality in mass market goods.<ref>Designs on love, Le Monde, 10 February 2008</ref>
In 2007, Starck was the first designer to participate in the TED Talks (Technology, Entertainment & Design).<ref></ref>
Through his "democratic design" concept, Starck has campaigned for well-designed objects that are not just aimed for upper-tiered incomes. He has expressed this as a utopian ideal, approached in practice by increasing production quantities to cut costs and by using mail-order,<ref>"So it is absolutely possible to talk about a utopian project with Starck", Benoît Heilbrunn, Starck in Words, 2003</ref> via 3 Suisses. In 1998, Philippe Starck sets up the Good Goods catalogue with La Redoute, proposing 170 sustainable and respectful everyday life objects "for the future moral market".<ref></ref> Later in 2000, driven by his desire to make design accessible for everyone, he works with Target Stores and proposes a collection of more than 50 exclusive and affordable products.<ref></ref>
Starck released Ideas Box in 2011 for Bibliothèques Sans Frontières. These kit media libraries give the refugee populations access to culture and information. The can by installed anywhere around the world and provide screens, books, games, cameras etc.<ref></ref>
One of the ways Starck has economized costs for the public<ref>"I'm against beautiful objects. I prefer good objects . I'll stop when my chairs cost fifty bucks", L'Express, 22 October 1998</ref> is his plastic-furniture line, producing pieces such as the Kartell Louis Ghost chair, over a million of which have been sold. He has also been involved in the development of Fluocaril toothbrushes<ref> urltoken Museum of Design in Plastics, Philippe Starck toothbrush and holder.</ref> to bathroom fittings for Duravit, Hansgrohe, Hoesch and Axor, from Alessi's Juicy Salif lemon squeezer to Zikmu speakers, Zik headphones by Parrot, Laguiole knife,<ref></ref> Starckeyes glasses by Mikli and the Marie Coquine lamp for Baccarat.<ref>"Philippe Starck sets in motion an education of the masses. To the greatest number of people, he distributes forms that educate the eye … From the minute to the immense, Starck marks out the paths that reconcile aesthetic, ethical and political", Michel Onfray, Starck in Words, 2003</ref>
Alongside his work, Starck partnered with Moustache Bikes for the M.A.S.S. (Mud, Asphalt, Sand and Snow). This is a portfolio of four e-bikes that use a Bosch electrical engine and battery pack.<ref></ref>
In January 2013 Starck redesigned the Navigo travel pass.<ref>Philippe Starck waived his fee for designing this new-generation card, said transport authority STIF. Its pared-down design is intended to make it last, Le Parisien, January 2012</ref>
===Technology===
In 1996, Starck worked with Alain Mikli to launch Starck Eyes. Bought in 2013 by Luxottica, Starck Eyes becomes Starck Biotech Paris in 2019 and is inspired by the human body to create revolutionary eyewear, merging design with biomechanics.<ref></ref>
Starck helped design the Xiaomi Mi MIX smartphone, notable for having a 6.4-inch "whole surface screen".<ref></ref>
In 2016 Starck developed a GPS-tracking wristband, DIAL (Individual Alert and Localization Device) for Société nationale de Sauvetage en Mer, which allows endangered people to share their exact location to rescue service whether they are in the sea or in the beach.<ref></ref>
In 2019 the so-called AI chair was presented to the public. Starck cooperated with experts of the 3D software company Autodesk and created a chair design with help of an Artificial Intelligence.<ref></ref> The same year he teames up with the corsican start-up Icare Technologies to imagine the design of Aeklys by Starck, a connected ring which allows contactless payment among other parameters.
In 2020 Starck collaborates with Axiom Space and creates the interior of the International Space Station's housing module. A comfortable and luxurious living space adapted to weightlessness, with suede-textured walls, big windows to appreciate the view and all the technology needed to stay connected.<ref></ref>
===Political messaging===
Sometimes pointed political messages, combined with the unexpected and humour<ref>"I'm convinced that for many, the political nature of his work is not only hard to detect but of little interest . yet for most of us, the most sensational thing about Starck's architecture and design is the combination of fun and the unexpected", Zoom sur Philippe Starck, Courrier International, 2 September 1995</ref> can be found in Starck's projects, such as the subversive Gun Lamp (Flos, 2005), the Superarchimoon floor lamp (Flos, 2000), in fact a giant architect's lamp standing 217 centimetres high, the Haaa!!! and Hooo!!! lamps he imagined with the American artist Jenny Holzer (Flos/Baccarat, 2009) and the chandeliers in the Darkside collection, featuring the Zenith chandelier (Baccarat, 2005).
