Acadian French

==Phonology==
Since there was relatively little linguistic contact with France from the late 18th century to the 20th century, Acadian French retained features that died out during the French standardization efforts of the 19th century such as these:
* The phoneme, Acadian French has retained an alveolar trill or an alveolar flap, but modern speakers pronounced it as in Parisian French: (red) can be pronounced , or .
* In nonstandard Acadian French, the third-person plural ending of verbs ‹›, such as (they eat), is still pronounced, unlike standard French (France and Quebec) (France)/ or (Quebec)), the ‹e› can be pronounced or not, but ‹-nt› is always silent.
According to Wiesmath (2006),<ref> urltoken Accessed 5 May 2011.</ref> some characteristics of Acadian are:
*The verbal ending -ont in the third person plural
*Palatalization of and to and , respectively
*A featured called "l'ouisme" where bonne is pronounced 
These features typically occur in older speech.
Many aspects of Acadian French (vocabulary and "trill r", etc.) are still common in rural areas in the South West of France. Speakers of Metropolitan French and even of other Canadian varieties of French sometimes have difficulty understanding Acadian French. Within North America, its closest relative is the Cajun French spoken in Southern Louisiana since both were born out of the same population that were affected during the Expulsion of the Acadians.

===Affrication===
* and are commonly replaced by before a front vowel. For example, and are usually pronounced and . is pronounced .
* and often become (sometimes before a front vowel. For example, and become and in informal Acadian French. becomes . (This pronunciation led to the word Cajun, from Acadien.)
===Metathesis===
Metathesis is quite common. For example, (Wednesday) is , and (poverty) is . (the pronoun "I") is frequently pronounced and is frequently pronounced .
In words, "re" is often pronounced "er". For instance :
* for "", for "", for "", for "", for "".
===Vowels===
* Acadian French has maintained phonemic distinctions between and , and , and , and .
* In informal speech, the vowel is realized as : pas (step) → and bras (arm) → , etc. 
* The short is realized as and it's the same as Parisian French.
* is open to : fête (party) → and caisse (case) → , etc. 
* The ⟨oi⟩ spelling has different pronunciations. Old speakers pronounce it , because the traditional Parisian pronunciation was like this: roi (king) . But in modern standard Acadian French, it is pronounced . Even where there is no circumflex, there are some words which are phonemically pronounced and the phoneme is pronounced as in formal speech but in informal speech: trois (three) or and noix (nut) or . The ⟨oî⟩ spelling is phonemically , but old speakers pronounce it . but modern speakers pronounce it as in Quebec French: boîte (box) or and croître (grow) or , etc.
===Elision of final consonants===
* Consonant clusters finishing a word are reduced, often losing altogether the last or two last consonants in informal speech: table (table) → and livre (book/pound) → ,<ref> urltoken etc.
==Vocabulary==
Yves Cormier's Dictionnaire du français acadien (ComiersAcad)<ref> urltoken Retrieved 5 May 2011.</ref> includes the majority of Acadian regionalisms. From a syntactic point of view, a major feature is the use of je both for the first person singular and plural; the same phenomenon takes place with i for the third persons. Acadian still differentiates the vous form from the tu form.
===Numerals===
* In the Nova Scotian communities of Wedgeport and Pubnico the numbers (seventy), (eighty) and (ninety) are instead called and respectively, a phenomenon also observed in Swiss French and Belgian French.

Acadian French is a variety of French originally associated with the Acadians of what is now the Maritimes in Canada. The language is spoken by the Acadian Francophone population of the Canadian province of New Brunswick, by small minorities on the Gaspé Peninsula and the Magdalen Islands of Quebec as well as in pockets of Francophones in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. In the United States, it is spoken in the Saint John Valley of northern Aroostook County, Maine. Besides standard French, New England French is the predominant form of French spoken elsewhere in Maine.
