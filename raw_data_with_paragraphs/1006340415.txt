==Controversies and criticisms==
The Tata Group has also attracted some controversy during its more than 150 years in operation, notably:
===Munnar, Kerala===
The Kerala Government filed an affidavit in the high court alleging that Tata Tea had "grabbed" forest land of at Munnar. The Tatas provided that they possessed of land, which they are allowed to retain under the Kannan Devan Hill (Resumption of Lands) Act, 1971, and there was a shortage of in that. The Chief Minister of Kerala V.S. Achuthanandan, who vowed to evict all on government land in Munnar, formed a special squad for the Munnar land takeover mission and started acquiring back properties. However, the mission was aborted due to both influential land-holders and opposition from Achuthanandan's own party.<ref></ref>
===Kalinganagar, Orissa===
On 2 January 2006, Kalinganagar, Tribal Orissa villagers protested the construction of a new steel plant for Tata Steel on land historically owned by them. Some of the villagers had been evicted without adequate relocation. Police retribution was brutal: 37 protesters were injured and 13 killed, including 3 women and a 13-year-old boy. One policeman was hacked to death by a mob, after police had opened fire on protestors with tear gas and rubber bullets. Family members of the deceased villagers later claimed that the bodies had been mutilated during post-mortem examination.<ref></ref>
===Supplies to Burma's military regime===
In December 2006, Myanmar's chief of general staff, General Thura Shwe Mann, visited the Tata Motors plant in Pune.<ref> urltoken "Myanmar Ties." 8 December 2006. The Telegraph, Calcutta, India.</ref> In 2009, TATA Motors announced that it would manufacture trucks in Myanmar. Tata Motors reported that these contracts to supply hardware and automobiles to Burma's military were subsequently criticised by human rights activists.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
=== Singur land acquisition ===
The Singur controversy<ref></ref> in West Bengal was a series of protests by locals and political parties over the forced acquisition, eviction, and inadequate compensation to those farmers displaced for the Tata Nano plant, during which Mamata Banerjee's party was widely criticised as acting for political gain. Despite the support of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) state government, Tata eventually pulled the project out of West Bengal, citing safety concerns. Narendra Modi, then Chief Minister of Gujarat, made land available for the Nano project.<ref></ref>
On Aug 31, 2016, in a historic judgement, the Honorable Supreme Court of India set aside the land acquisition by the West Bengal Government in 2006 that had facilitated Tata Motors' Nano plant, stating that the West Bengal government had not taken possession of the land legally, and were now required to repossess and return it to local farmers within 12 weeks without compensation.<ref></ref>
===Dhamra Port, Odisha===
The Port of Dhamara has received significant coverage, sparking controversy in India, and in Tata's emerging global markets.<ref></ref> The Dhamra port, an equal joint venture between Tata Steel and Larsen & Toubro, has been criticised for its proximity to the Gahirmatha Sanctuary and Bhitarkanika National Park by Indian and international organisations, including Greenpeace; Gahirmatha Beach is one of the world's largest mass nesting sites for the olive ridley turtle, and India's second largest mangrove forest, Bhitarkanika, is a designated Ramsar site, and critics claimed that the port could disrupt mass nesting at Gahirmtha beaches as well as the ecology of the Bitharkanika mangrove forest.<ref></ref><ref></ref>
TATA Steel employed mitigation measures set by the project's official advisor, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and the company pledging to "adopt all its recommendations without exception" when conservation organisations asserted that a thorough environmental impact analysis had not been done for the project, which had undergone changes in size and specifications since it was first proposed.<ref> urltoken Tata Steel "Corporate Citizenship Report 2010/2011", TataSteel.com, 2011, page 20. Retrieved October 24, 2018.</ref>
===Proposed soda extraction plant in Tanzania===
In 2007, Tata Group joined forces with a Tanzanian company to build a soda ash extraction plant in Tanzania.<ref name="autogenerated1"></ref> Environmental activists oppose the plant because it would be near Lake Natron, and it has a very high chance of affecting the lake's ecosystem and its neighbouring dwellers,<ref name="autogenerated2"></ref> jeopardising endangered lesser flamingo birds. Lake Natron is where two-thirds of lesser flamingos reproduce.<ref></ref> Producing soda ash involves drawing out salt water from the lake, and then disposing the water back to the lake. This process could interrupt the chemical makeup of the lake.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> 22 African nations signed a petition to stop its construction.<ref name="autogenerated1" />
===Epic Systems trade-secret case judgement===
In April 2016, a U.S. Federal Grand Jury awarded Epic Systems a $940 million judgement against Tata Consultancy Services and Tata America International Corp. Filed 31 October 2014; the suit charged that "6,477 unauthorized downloads could be used to enhance Tata's competing product, Med Mantra."<ref name="Grand Jury Award"></ref><ref name="Epic case to trial"></ref><ref name="EHR Intelligence"></ref> In 2017, U.S. District Court Judge William Conley reduced the Award to $420 million; the company states that the judgement is also being appealed, as "not supported by evidence presented during the trial and a strong appeal can be made to superior court to fully set aside the jury verdict.”<ref> urltoken Wahlberg, David "Award to Epic in trade secrets case reduced from $940 million to $420 million", Wisconsin State Journal, October 4, 2017. Retrieved July 12, 2018.</ref>
===2018 NCLT verdict===
In July 2018, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which "adjudicates issues relating to Indian companies,"<ref></ref> issued a verdict in the company's favor on charges of mismanagement leveled in 2016 by ousted chairman, Cyrus Mistry.<ref></ref>
