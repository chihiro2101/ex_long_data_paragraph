Tom Strong

== Fictional character biography ==
Tom was reared in a high-gravity chamber and given an intensive education by his eccentric scientist parents on the fictional Caribbean island of Attabar Teru. His upbringing, plus ingesting a root used by the natives of the island for health and long life, have made him nearly physically and mentally perfect. Though born at the dawn of the 20th century, by the year 2000 he looks as if he is only in his 40s.
Tom Strong frequently has adventures alongside his younger self. There is also a parallel cartoon universe where a talking bunny is a version of Tom Strong, as well as a Western universe, and even "Tom Teen", where characters are similar to those from Archie Comics.
== Powers and abilities ==
Tom Strong has super-strength and is an inventive genius. Strong maintains his physical health and longevity through the regular consumption of a mysterious herb called Goloka Root. He is an explorer with vast personal wealth and has contributed greatly to the technology available in Millennium City.

* Another would be a Young Tom Strong tale (set during Strong's formative years on Attabar Teru, and illustrated by Alan Weiss);
* A Jonni Future story (by Steve Moore and Art Adams) would often round out the issue.
The series ran for twelve issues, and would be sporadically published over the space of a couple of years. Stories of note include:
* A silent story in which Tesla steals the keys to the Hyper-Saucer and parties on another planet (art by Jaime Hernandez; appeared in issue 1)
* King Solomon in a solo adventure (by Leah Moore and Sergio Aragonés; appeared in issue 5)
* A prose history of Millennium City, with illustrations by Mike Kaluta (appeared in issue 9)
* Another silent story, with art by Peter Kuper (appeared in issue 10); and
* A collaboration between Alan Moore and Peter Bagge, which recasts the Strong family in a milieu not unlike the one used by Bagge in his Hate (comic) stories. This was printed in the final issue (#12), and features appearances by characters resembling Dick Tracy, Fred Flintstone and Kool-Aid.
