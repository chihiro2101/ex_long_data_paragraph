Negative capability

==Keats: The poet's turn of phrase==
Keats used the phrase only briefly in a private letter, and it became known only after his correspondence was collected and published. In a letter to his brothers, George and Thomas, on 22 December 1817, Keats described a conversation he had been engaged in a few days previously:<ref></ref>
<blockquote>
I had not a dispute but a disquisition with Dilke, upon various subjects; several things dove-tailed in my mind, and at once it struck me what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, especially in Literature, and which Shakespeare possessed so enormously—I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason—Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.<ref></ref>
</blockquote>
Samuel Taylor Coleridge was, by 1817, a frequent target of criticism by the younger poets of Keats's generation, often ridiculed for his infatuation with German idealistic philosophy. Against Coleridge's obsession with philosophical truth, Keats sets up the model of Shakespeare, whose poetry articulated various points of view and never advocated a particular vision of truth.
Keats's ideas here, as was usually the case in his letters, were expressed tersely with no effort to fully expound what he meant, but passages from other letters enlarge on the same theme. In a letter to J.H. Reynolds in February 1818, he wrote:
<blockquote>
We hate poetry that has a palpable design upon us—and if we do not agree, seems to put its hand in its breeches pocket. Poetry should be great & unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one's soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself but with its subject.<ref></ref>
</blockquote>
In another letter to Reynolds the following May, he contrived the metaphor of 'the chamber of maiden thought' and the notion of the 'burden of mystery', which together express much the same idea as that of negative capability:
<blockquote>
I compare human life to a large Mansion of Many Apartments, two of which I can only describe, the doors of the rest being as yet shut upon me—The first we step into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in which we remain as long as we do not think—We remain there a long while, and notwithstanding the doors of the second Chamber remain wide open, showing a bright appearance, we care not to hasten to it; but are at length imperceptibly impelled by the awakening of the thinking principle—within us—we no sooner get into the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with the light and the atmosphere, we see nothing but pleasant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in delight: However among the effects this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one's vision into the heart and nature of Man—of convincing ones nerves that the World is full of Misery and Heartbreak, Pain, Sickness, and oppression—whereby This Chamber of Maiden Thought becomes gradually darken'd and at the same time on all sides of it many doors are set open—but all dark—all leading to dark passages—We see not the balance of good and evil. We are in a Mist—We are now in that state—We feel the 'burden of the Mystery,' To this point was Wordsworth come, as far as I can conceive when he wrote 'Tintern Abbey' and it seems to me that his Genius is explorative of those dark Passages. Now if we live, and go on thinking, we too shall explore them. he is a Genius and superior to us, in so far as he can, more than we, make discoveries, and shed a light in them—Here I must think Wordsworth is deeper than Milton.<ref></ref>
</blockquote>
Keats understood Coleridge as searching for a single, higher-order truth or solution to the mysteries of the natural world. He went on to find the same fault in Dilke and Wordsworth. All these poets, he claimed, lacked objectivity and universality in their view of the human condition and the natural world. In each case, Keats found a mind which was a narrow private path, not a "thoroughfare for all thoughts". Lacking for Keats were the central and indispensable qualities requisite for flexibility and openness to the world, or what he referred to as negative capability.<ref>Wigod, Jacob D. 1952. "Negative Capability and Wise Passiveness." PMLA 67 (4) (1 June): 384–386</ref>
This concept of Negative Capability is precisely a rejection of set philosophies and preconceived systems of nature.<ref></ref> He demanded that the poet be receptive rather than searching for fact or reason, and to not seek absolute knowledge of every truth, mystery, or doubt.<ref name=":2">Goellnicht, Donald. "Negative Capability and Wise Passiveness" MA Thesis. (McMaster University, 1976), 5, 11–12. urltoken 
==Why 'Negative'?==
In the same way that chameleons are 'negative' for colour, so Keatsian poets are negative for self and identity:<ref></ref> they change their identity with each subject they inhabit.<ref></ref> This is a kind of personal Tao, and like the cosmic Tao, negative capablity can be difficult to grasp because it is not a name for a thing but rather a way of feeling or of knowing. This intuitive knowing of the inner life of, for example, a nightingale or a grecian urn, cannot be grasped as a concept; as with Tao, it is known through actual living experience of one's everyday changeable being.<ref></ref> And this capability depends on being negative to what Keats called 'Consequitive reasoning'.<ref></ref>
Another explanation of the word Negative relies on hypothesising that Keats was influenced in his studies of medicine and chemistry, and that it refers to the negative pole of an electric current which is passive and receptive. In the same way that the negative pole receives the current from the positive pole, the poet receives impulses from a world that is full of mystery and doubt, which cannot be explained but which the poet can translate into art.<ref name=":1">Goellnicht, Donald. "Negative Capability and Wise Passiveness" MA Thesis. (McMaster University, 1976), 13. urltoken 
Whatever the reason, modern psychological experiments indicate that his choice of the word Negative was truly inspired. If a composing poet is placed in a functional magnetic resonance imager (fMRI), it turns out that the initial stage of poetic inspiration relates to something negative: the attenuation of self‐monitoring and top‐down attention, related to decreases in executive control mediated by deactivation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).<ref name=":0"></ref> In this sense, Keats might be seen as providing an antidote to E. M. Forster's mantra of urltoken Only connect.<nowiki/>'. Keats might be seen as saying 'Only disconnect.' from our reassuring certainties, from our hyperconnected world, from our executive control, and from our prefrontal cortex.<ref name=":0" /><ref></ref> 'O for a Life of Sensations rather than of Thoughts!’ is how Keats expressed this in a letter to Benjamin Bailey in 1817.<ref>The Letters of John Keats, ed. by H E Rollins, 2 vols (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1958), i, p 185. <nowiki> urltoken 
==Contrasted with positive capability==
When we are presented with external stress, our autonomic nervous system provides us with a 'fight or flight' response. This seems like a binary choice. But Keats provides us with a third way. Fight or flight has been called positive capability, and teachers of mindfulness stress the importance of cultivating negative capability in order to overcome and provide an alternative to our routine reactions to stress.<ref></ref> They point out that this teaches tolerance of uncertainty, and enriches decision making. Which is more important: negative or positive capability? Discussing this at length might be as sterile as debating which pole of a battery is more important: the positive or negative terminal? The point is: a battery is only a battery if it has both.
==Why is it important?==
The sections below show that negative capability is not the exclusive preserve of poets, but can describe the pre-creative mood of any artist, scientist, or religious person. So negative capability is important as a wellspring of our humanity and an explanation of how periods of indolence give rise to periods of creativity.<ref name=":1" />
==The competition (varieties of prepoetry)==
Negative capability needs to be understood as just one of a number of moods that may compete in the poet's mind before the poem arrives—i.e. during the phase that may be called prepoetry, after the musical form of the same name which delights in 'uncertainties, mysteries, and doubts'.<ref></ref> The only valid way to approach this subject is through the words of poets themselves, e.g.:
 urltoken Emotion recollected in tranquility and wise passivity (e.g. Wordswoth)<br> urltoken The systematic derangement of the senses (e.g. Rimbaud).<br> urltoken Automatic writing and thought transference (e.g. Yeats).<br> urltoken Frenzy<ref></ref> (e.g. Shakespeare). 
<blockquote>The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,<br>Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;<br>And as imagination bodies forth <br> forms of things unknown, the poet's pen<br> Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing <br> A local habitation and a name.
<p align=right>(A Midsummer Night's Dream, Act V scene 1, from line 1841)<ref></ref> and this song shows their close affinity through contiguous explorations of their respective negative capabilities.
In 2013 jazz guitarist Bern Nix released an album titled "Negative Capabilty", containing liner notes explaining Keats definition.
==Criticism==
Stanley Fish has expressed strong reservations about the attempt to apply the concept of negative capability to social contexts. He criticized Unger's early work as being unable to chart a route for the idea to pass into reality, which leaves history closed and the individual holding onto the concept while kicking against air. Fish finds the capability Unger invokes in his early works unimaginable and unmanufacturable that can only be expressed outright in blatant speech, or obliquely in concept.<ref>S. Fish, "Unger and Milton", in Doing What Comes Naturally (1989): 430</ref> More generally, Fish finds the idea of radical culture as an oppositional ideal in which context is continuously refined or rejected impracticable at best, and impossible at worst.<ref>H. Aram Veeser ed., The Stanley Fish Reader (Oxford 1999) p.216-7</ref> Unger has addressed these criticisms by developing a full theory of historical process in which negative capability is employed.<ref></ref>
In The Life in the Sonnets, David Fuller makes use of negative capability in addressing the qualities and potential of writing literary criticism. A critic's experience and feelings altogether form a strong framework to expand one's ability in critical thinking, while negative capability replaces the notion of correctness in analyzing literary texts.<ref></ref>

Negative capability is a phrase first used by Romantic poet John Keats in 1817 to explain the capacity of the greatest writers (particularly Shakespeare) to pursue a vision of artistic beauty even when it leads them into intellectual confusion and uncertainty, as opposed to a preference for philosophical certainty over artistic beauty. The term has been used by poets and philosophers to describe the ability to perceive and recognise truths beyond the reach of consecutive reasoning.<ref></ref><ref>Keats wrote : 'I have never yet been able to perceive how any thing can be known for truth by consequitive reasoning' (Letters I 184) urltoken
