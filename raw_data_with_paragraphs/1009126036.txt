Vladimir Ashkenazy

== Early life ==
Vladimir Ashkenazy was born in Gorky, Soviet Union (now Nizhny Novgorod, Russia), to pianist and composer David Ashkenazi and to actress Yevstolia Grigorievna (born Plotnova). His father was Jewish and his mother came from a Russian Orthodox family. Ashkenazy was christened in a Russian Orthodox church.<ref name="Independent"> urltoken Ashkenazy – Still Russian to the core, The Independent, 3 October 2008 (retrieved 23 October 2008)</ref><ref> urltoken Iceland Review Online: Daily News from Iceland, Current Affairs, Business, Politics, Sports, Culture.

==Education==
Ashkenazy attended the Moscow Conservatory where he studied with Lev Oborin and Boris Zemliansky. He won second prize in the International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1955 and the first prize in the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition in Brussels in 1956. He shared the first prize in the 1962 International Tchaikovsky Competition with British pianist John Ogdon. As a student, like many in that period, he was harassed by the KGB to become an "informer". He did not really cooperate, despite pressures from the authorities.
==Personal life==
In 1961, he married the Iceland-born Þórunn Jóhannsdóttir, who studied piano at the Moscow Conservatory.<ref name="Independent"/> To marry Ashkenazy, Þórunn was forced to give up her Icelandic citizenship and declare that she wanted to live in the USSR. Her name is usually transliterated as "Thorunn"; her nickname was Dódý,<ref></ref> so she is called Dódý Ashkenazy.<ref></ref>
After numerous bureaucratic procedures, the Soviet authorities agreed to allow the Ashkenazys to visit the West for musical performances and for visits to his parents-in-law with their first grandson. In his memoirs, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev recollected that Ashkenazy had married an Englishwoman and on a visit to London refused to return to the Soviet Union. Khrushchev mentioned that Ashkenazy then sought advice from the Soviet Embassy in London, who in turn referred the matter to Moscow. Khrushchev said he was of the opinion that to require Ashkenazy to return to the USSR would have made him an "Anti-Soviet". He further said that this was a good example of an artist being able to come and go in and out of the USSR freely, which Ashkenazy said was a gross "distortion of the truth".<ref>Khrushchev Remembers, London 1971 p. 521</ref> In 1963, Ashkenazy decided to leave the USSR permanently, establishing residence in London, where his wife's parents lived.
The couple moved to Iceland in 1968 where, in 1972, Ashkenazy became an Icelandic citizen.<ref> urltoken Vladimir Ashkenazy.

Their fifth child, Alexandra Inga, was born in 1979. As of 1989, Ashkenazy resides in Meggen.<ref> urltoken Interview with Vladimir Ashkenazy Basler Zeitung, 3 March 2015</ref> His eldest son Vladimir, who uses his nickname 'Vovka' as a stage name, is a pianist, as well as a teacher at the Imola International Piano Academy. His second son, Dimitri, is a clarinetist.
== Critical reception ==
The Guardian wrote that Ashkenazy conducted pieces by Prokofiev and Glière like he was "born to do it" during a concert series that explored the musical response to the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, including composer Alexander Mosolov's Iron Foundry (1927) and the suite from The Red Poppy, a ballet with music by Glière.<ref></ref>
