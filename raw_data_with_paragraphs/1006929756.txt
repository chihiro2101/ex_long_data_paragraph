Retail

==Etymology==
The word retail comes from the Old French verb tailler, meaning "to cut off, clip, pare, divide in terms of tailoring" (c. 1365). It was first recorded as a noun in 1433 with the meaning of "a sale in small quantities" from the Middle French verb retailler meaning "a piece cut off, shred, scrap, paring".<ref></ref> At the present, the meaning of the word retail (in English, French, Dutch, German and Spanish) refers to the sale of small quantities of items to consumers (as opposed to wholesale).
==Definition and explanation==
Retail refers to the activity of selling goods or services directly to consumers or end-users.<ref> urltoken The Free Dictionary</ref> Some retailers may sell to business customers, and such sales are termed non-retail activity. In some jurisdictions or regions, legal definitions of retail specify that at least 80 percent of sales activity must be to end-users.<ref>Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C. Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S. Niininen, O. and Casidy, R., Marketing Principles, 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018, pp. 449–50</ref>
Retailing often occurs in retail stores or service establishments, but may also occur through direct selling such as through vending machines, door-to-door sales or electronic channels.<ref>Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C. Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S. Niininen, O. and Casidy, R., Marketing Principles, 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018, p. 451</ref>
Although the idea of retail is often associated with the purchase of goods, the term may be applied to service-providers that sell to consumers. Retail service providers include retail banking, tourism, insurance, private healthcare, private education, private security firms, legal firms, publishers, public transport and others. For example, a tourism provider might have a retail division that books travel and accommodation for consumers plus a wholesale division that purchases blocks of accommodation, hospitality, transport and sightseeing which are subsequently packaged into a holiday tour for sale to retail travel agents.
Some retailers badge their stores as "wholesale outlets" offering "wholesale prices." While this practice may encourage consumers to imagine that they have access to lower prices, while being prepared to trade-off reduced prices for cramped in-store environments, in a strictly legal sense, a store that sells the majority of its merchandise direct to consumers, is defined as a retailer rather than a wholesaler. Different jurisdictions set parameters for the ratio of consumer to business sales that define a retail business.
== History ==
.<ref>McGeough, K.M., The Romans: New Perspectives, ABC-CLIO, 2004, pp. 105–06</ref> The Roman forum was arguably the earliest example of a permanent retail shop-front.<ref>Coleman, P., Shopping Environments, Elsevier, Oxford, 2006, p. 28</ref> Recent research suggests that China exhibited a rich history of early retail systems.<ref>Moore, K., and Reid., S., "The Birth of the Brand: 4000 years of Branding", Business History, Vol. 50, 2008. pp. 419–32.</ref> From as early as 200 BCE, Chinese packaging and branding were used to signal family, place names and product quality, and the use of government imposed product branding was used between 600 and 900 CE.<ref>Eckhardt, G.M. and Bengtsson. A. "A Brief History of Branding in China", Journal of Macromarketing, Vol, 30, no. 3, 2010, pp. 210–21</ref> Eckhart and Bengtsson have argued that during the Song Dynasty (960–1127), Chinese society developed a consumerist culture, where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite.<ref>Eckhardt, G.M. and Bengtsson. A. "A Brief History of Branding in China", Journal of Macromarketing, Vol, 30, no. 3, 2010, p. 212</ref>
In Medieval England and Europe, relatively few permanent shops were to be found; instead, customers walked into the tradesman's workshops where they discussed purchasing options directly with tradesmen.<ref>Thrupp, S.L., The Merchant Class of Medieval London, 1300–1500, pp. 7–8</ref> In the more populous cities, a small number of shops were beginning to emerge by the 13th century.<ref>Pevsner, N. and Hubbard, E., The Buildings of England: Cheshire Penguin, 1978, p. 170</ref> Outside the major cities, most consumable purchases were made through markets or fairs.<ref> urltoken Gazetteer of Markets and Fairs in England and Wales to 1516, The List and Index Society, no. 32, 2003</ref> Market-places appear to have emerged independently outside Europe. The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is often cited as the world's oldest continuously-operating market; its construction began in 1455. The Spanish conquistadors wrote glowingly of markets in the Americas. In the 15th century, the Mexica (Aztec) market of Tlatelolco was the largest in all the Americas.<ref></ref>
By the 17th century, permanent shops with more regular trading hours were beginning to supplant markets and fairs as the main retail outlet. Provincial shopkeepers were active in almost every English market town.<ref>Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England, Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, p,. 129</ref> As the number of shops grew, they underwent a transformation. The trappings of a modern shop, which had been entirely absent from the sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century store, gradually made way for store interiors and shopfronts that are more familiar to modern shoppers. Prior to the eighteenth century, the typical retail store had no counter, display cases, chairs, mirrors, changing rooms, etc. However, the opportunity for the customer to browse merchandise, touch and feel products began to be available, with retail innovations from the late 17th and early 18th centuries.<ref>Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England, Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, pp. 153–54</ref>
By the late eighteenth century, grand shopping arcades began to emerge across Europe and in the Antipodes. A shopping arcade refers to a multiple-vendor space, operating under a covered roof. Typically, the roof was constructed of glass to allow for natural light and to reduce the need for candles or electric lighting. Some of the earliest examples of shopping arcade appeared in Paris, due to its lack of pavement for pedestrians.<ref name="Conlin, J. 2013">Conlin, J., Tales of Two Cities: Paris, London and the Birth of the Modern City, Atlantic Books, 2013, Chapter 2</ref> While the arcades were the province of the bourgeoisie, a new type of retail venture emerged to serve the needs of the working poor. John Stuart Mill wrote about the rise of the co-operative retail store, which he witnessed first-hand in the mid-nineteenth century.<ref>Mill, J.S., Principles of a Political Economy with some of their Applications to Social Philosophy, 7th ed., London, Longman, 1909, Section IV.7.53</ref>
The modern era of retailing is defined as the period from the industrial revolution to the 21st century.<ref>Reshaping Retail: Why Technology is Transforming the Industry and How to Win in the New Consumer Dr</ref> In major cities, the department store emerged in the mid- to late 19th century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and redefined concepts of service and luxury.<ref></ref> Many of the early department stores were more than just a retail emporium; rather they were venues where shoppers could spend their leisure time and be entertained.<ref>Howard Moss, M., Shopping as an Entertainment Experience, Plymouth, Lexington Books, pp. 35–39</ref> Retail, using mail order, came of age during the mid-19th century. Although catalogue sales had been used since the 15th century, this method of retailing was confined to a few industries such as the sale of books and seeds. However, improvements in transport and postal services led several entrepreneurs on either side of the Atlantic to experiment with catalogue sales.<ref>Goldstein. J., 101 Amazing Facts about Wales, Andrews, UK, 2013</ref>
In the post-war period, an American architect, Victor Gruen developed a concept for a shopping mall; a planned, self-contained shopping complex complete with an indoor plaza, statues, planting schemes, piped music, and car-parking. Gruen's vision was to create a shopping atmosphere where people felt so comfortable, they would spend more time in the environment, thereby enhancing opportunities for purchasing. The first of these malls opened at Northland Mall near Detroit in 1954.<ref name="NYer04">Malcolm Gladwell, urltoken The Terrazzo Jungle, The New Yorker, March 15, 2004</ref> Throughout the twentieth century, a trend towards larger store footprints became discernible. The average size of a U.S. supermarket grew from square feet in 1991 to square feet in 2000.<ref>Byrne-Paquet, L., The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping, ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, p. 83</ref> By the end of the twentieth century, stores were using labels such as "mega-stores" and "warehouse" stores to reflect their growing size.<ref></ref> The upward trend of increasing retail space was not consistent across nations and led in the early 21st century to a 2-fold difference in square footage per capita between the United States and Europe.<ref></ref>
As the 21st century takes shape, some indications suggest that large retail stores have come under increasing pressure from online sales models and that reductions in store size are evident.<ref>Wetherell, S., urltoken "The Shopping Mall’s Socialist Pre-History", Jacobin Magazine, 4 August 2014</ref> Under such competition and other issues such as business debt,<ref></ref> there has been a noted business disruption called the retail apocalypse in recent years which several retail businesses, especially in North America, are sharply reducing their number of stores, or going out of business entirely.
==Retail strategy==
The distinction between "strategic" and "managerial" decision-making is commonly used to distinguish "two phases having different goals and based on different conceptual tools. Strategic planning concerns the choice of policies aiming at improving the competitive position of the firm, taking account of challenges and opportunities proposed by the competitive environment. On the other hand, managerial decision-making is focused on the implementation of specific targets."<ref>Volpato, G. and Stocchetti, A., urltoken "Old and new approaches to marketing: The quest of their epistemological roots", MPRA Paper No. 30841, 2009, p. 34</ref>
In retailing, the strategic plan is designed to set out the vision and provide guidance for retail decision-makers and provide an outline of how the product and service mix will optimize customer satisfaction. As part of the strategic planning process, it is customary for strategic planners to carry out a detailed environmental scan which seeks to identify trends and opportunities in the competitive environment, market environment, economic environment and statutory-political environment. The retail strategy is normally devised or reviewed every 3– 5 years by the chief executive officer.
The strategic retail analysis typically includes following elements:<ref>Lambda, A.J., The Art Of Retailing, McGraw-Hill, (2003), 2008, pp. 315–26</ref>
; * Market analysis
::Market size, stage of market, market competitiveness, market attractiveness, market trends
; * Customer analysis
::Market segmentation, demographic, geographic and psychographic profile, values and attitudes, shopping habits, brand preferences, analysis of needs and wants, media habits
; * Internal analysis
:: Other capabilities e.g. human resource capability, technological capability, financial capability, ability to generate scale economies or economies of scope, trade relations, reputation, positioning, past performance
; * Competition analysis
:: Availability of substitutes, competitor's strengths and weaknesses, perceptual mapping, competitive trends
; * Review of product mix
:: Sales per square foot, stock-turnover rates, profitability per product line
; * Review of distribution channels
:: Lead-times between placing order and delivery, cost of distribution, cost efficiency of intermediaries
; * Evaluation of the economics of the strategy
:: Cost-benefit analysis of planned activities
At the conclusion of the retail analysis, retail marketers should have a clear idea of which groups of customers are to be the target of marketing activities. Not all elements are, however, equal, often with demographics, shopping motivations, and spending directing consumer activities.<ref></ref> Retail research studies suggest that there is a strong relationship between a store's positioning and the socio-economic status of customers.<ref>Fill, C., Marketing Communications: Framework, Theories and Application, London, Prentice Hall, 1995, p. 70</ref> In addition, the retail strategy, including service quality, has a significant and positive association with customer loyalty.<ref>Yu-Jia, H. (2012). "The Moderating Effect of Brand Equity and the Mediating Effect of Marketing Mix Strategy On the Relationship Between Service Quality and Customer Loyalty
". International Journal of Organizational Innovation, 155–62.</ref> A marketing strategy effectively outlines all key aspects of firms' targeted audience, demographics, preferences. In a highly competitive market, the retail strategy sets up long-term sustainability. It focuses on customer relationships, stressing the importance of added value, customer satisfaction and highlights how the store's market positioning appeals to targeted groups of customers.<ref>Morschett, D., Swoboda, B. and Schramm, H., "Competitive Strategies in Retailing: An Investigation of the Applicability of Porter’s Framework for Food Retailers Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, Vol. 13, 2006, pp. 275–87</ref>
==The retail marketing mix==
Once the strategic plan is in place, retail managers turn to the more managerial aspects of planning. A retail mix is devised for the purpose of coordinating day-to-day tactical decisions. The retail marketing mix typically consists of six broad decision layers including product decisions, place decisions, promotion, price, personnel and presentation (also known as physical evidence). The retail mix is loosely based on the marketing mix, but has been expanded and modified in line with the unique needs of the retail context. A number of scholars have argued for an expanded marketing, mix with the inclusion of two new Ps, namely, Personnel and Presentation since these contribute to the customer's unique retail experience and are the principal basis for retail differentiation. Yet other scholars argue that the Retail Format (i.e. retail formula) should be included.<ref>Constantinides, E., "The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing", Journal of Marketing Management, Vo. 22, 2006, pp. 422-423</ref> The modified retail marketing mix that is most commonly cited in textbooks is often called the 6 Ps of retailing (see diagram at right).<ref>Berens, J.S., "The Marketing Mix, the Retailing Mix and the Use of Retail Strategy Continua", Proceedings of the 1983 Academy of Marketing Science (AMS), Part of the series Developments in Marketing Science, pp. 323–27</ref><ref>Lamb, C.W., Hair, J.F. and McDaniel, C., MKTG 2010, Mason, OH, Cengage, pp. 193–94</ref> facing the retailer are the product assortment (what product lines, how many lines and which brands to carry); the type of customer service (high contact through to self-service) and the availability of support services (e.g. credit terms, delivery services, after sales care). These decisions depend on careful analysis of the market, demand, competition as well as the retailer's skills and expertise.
Customer service is the "sum of acts and elements that allow consumers to receive what they need or desire from the retail establishment." Retailers must decide whether to provide a full service outlet or minimal service outlet, such as no-service in the case of vending machines; self-service with only basic sales assistance or a full service operation as in many boutiques and speciality stores. In addition, the retailer needs to make decisions about sales support such as customer delivery and after sales customer care.
The broad pricing strategy is normally established in the company's overall strategic plan. In the case of chain stores, the pricing strategy would be set by head office. Broadly, there are six approaches to pricing strategy mentioned in the marketing literature: operations-oriented,<ref name="Dibb, S. 2013">Dibb, S., Simkin, L., Pride, W.C. and Ferrell, O.C., Marketing: Concepts and Strategies, Cengage, 2013, Chapter 12</ref> revenue-oriented,<ref name="Dibb, S. 2013" /> customer-oriented,<ref name="Dibb, S. 2013" /> value-based,<ref>Nagle, T., Hogan, J. and Zale, J., The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing: A Guide to Growing More Profitably, Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 1 and 6</ref><ref>Brennan, R., Canning, L. and McDowell, R., Business-to-Business Marketing, 2nd ed., London, Sage, 2011, p. 331</ref> relationship-oriented,<ref>Neumeier, M.,
The Brand Flip: Why customers now run companies and how to profit from it (Voices That Matter), 2008, p. 55</ref> and socially-oriented.<ref></ref> When decision-makers have determined the broad approach to pricing (i.e., the pricing strategy), they turn their attention to pricing tactics. Tactical pricing decisions are shorter term prices, designed to accomplish specific short-term goals. Pricing tactics that are commonly used in retail include discount pricing,<ref name="Rao, V.R 2009, p.15">Rao, V.R. and Kartono, B., "Pricing Strategies and Objectives: A Cross-cultural Survey", in Handbook of Pricing Research in Marketing, Rao, V.R.

All payment options require some type of handling and attract costs.<ref>Barr, A., "PayPal Deepens Retail Drive in Discover Payments Deal", Technology News. 22 August 2012</ref> Contrary to common misconception, price is not the most important factor for consumers, when deciding to buy a product.<ref> urltoken 
Because patronage at a retail outlet varies, flexibility in scheduling is desirable. Employee scheduling software is sold, which, using known patterns of customer patronage, more or less reliably predicts the need for staffing for various functions at times of the year, day of the month or week, and time of day. Usually needs vary widely. Conforming staff utilization to staffing needs requires a flexible workforce which is available when needed but does not have to be paid when they are not, part-time workers; as of 2012 70% of retail workers in the United States were part-time. This may result in financial problems for the workers, who while they are required to be available at all times if their work hours are to be maximized, may not have sufficient income to meet their family and other obligations.<ref name="NYT102812"></ref> Retailers can employ different techniques to enhance sales volume and to improve the customer experience, such as Add-on, Upsell or Cross-sell; Selling on value;<ref>Hee, J.K., "Stand-alone Sale of a Free Gift: Is it effective to accentuate promotion value?" Social Behavior & Personality, Vol. 43, no. 10, 2015, pp. 1593–1606</ref> and knowing when to close the sale.<ref></ref>
Transactional marketing aims to find target consumers, then negotiate, trade, and finally end relationships to complete the transaction. In this one-time transaction process, both parties aim to maximize their own interests. As a result, transactional marketing raises follow-up problems such as poor after-sales service quality and a lack of feedback channels for both parties. In addition, because retail enterprises needed to redevelop client relationships for each transaction, marketing costs were high and customer retention was low. All these downsides to transactional marketing gradually pushed the retail industry towards establishing long-term cooperative relationships with customers. Through this lens, enterprises began to focus on the process from transaction to relationship.<ref>Monash University, Dictionary, urltoken 
While expanding the sales market and attracting new customers is very important for the retail industry, it is also important to establish and maintain long term good relationships with previous customers, hence the name of the underlying concept, "relational marketing". Under this concept, retail enterprises value and attempt to improve relationships with customers, as customer relationships are conducive to maintaining stability in the current competitive retail market, and are also the future of retail enterprises.
Presentation refers to the physical evidence that signals the retail image. Physical evidence may include a diverse range of elements&nbsp;– the store itself including premises, offices, exterior facade and interior layout, websites, delivery vans, warehouses, staff uniforms. The environment in which the retail service encounter occurs is sometimes known as the retail servicescape.<ref>"The Impact of Retail Servicescape on Buying Behaviour", BVIMSR's Journal of Management Research, Vol 6, No. 2, 2014, pp. 10–17</ref> The store environment consists of many elements such as smells, the physical environment (furnishings, layout and functionality), ambient conditions (lighting, temperature, noise) as well as signs, symbols and artifacts (e.g. sales promotions, shelf space, sample stations, visual communications). Retail designers pay close attention to the front of the store, which is known as the decompression zone. In order to maximise the number of selling opportunities, retailers generally want customers to spend more time in a retail store. However, this must be balanced against customer expectations surrounding convenience, access and realistic waiting times.<ref>Wakefield, L.K. and Blodgett, G J., "The Effect of the Servicescape on Customers’ Behavioral Intentions in Leisure Service Settings", The Journal of Services Marketing, Vol. 10, No. 6, pp. 45–61.</ref> The way that brands are displayed is also part of the overall retail design. Where a product is placed on the shelves has implications for purchase likelihood as a result of visibility and access.<ref>Hall, C.M. and Mitchell, R., Wine Marketing: A Practical Guide, pp. 182–83</ref> Ambient conditions, such as lighting, temperature and music, are also part of the overall retail environment.<ref name="Bailey, P. 2015">Bailey, P.

==Shopper profiles==
Two different strands of research have investigated shopper behaviour. One strand is primarily concerned with shopper motivations. Another stream of research seeks to segment shoppers according to common, shared characteristics. To some extent, these streams of research are inter-related, but each stream offers different types of insights into shopper behaviour.
Babin et al. carried out some of the earliest investigations into shopper motivations and identified two broad motives: utilitarian and hedonic. Utilitarian motivations are task-related and rational. For the shopper with utilitarian motives, purchasing is a work-related task that is to be accomplished in the most efficient and expedient manner. On the other hand, hedonic motives refer to pleasure. The shopper with hedonic motivations views shopping as a form of escapism where they are free to indulge fantasy and freedom. Hedonic shoppers are more involved in the shopping experience.<ref></ref>
Many different shopper profiles can be identified. Retailers develop customised segmentation analyses for each unique outlet. However, it is possible to identify a number of broad shopper profiles. One of the most well-known and widely cited shopper typologies is that developed by Sproles and Kendal in the mid-1980s.<ref>Durvasula, S., Lysonski, S. and Andrews, J.C.

* Quality conscious/Perfectionist: Quality-consciousness is characterised by a consumer's search for the very best quality in products; quality conscious consumers tend to shop systematically making more comparisons and shopping around.
* Brand-conscious: Brand-consciousness is characterised by a tendency to buy expensive, well-known brands or designer labels. Those who score high on brand-consciousness tend to believe that the higher prices are an indicator of quality and exhibit a preference for department stores or top-tier retail outlets.
* Recreation-conscious/Hedonistic: Recreational shopping is characterised by the consumer's engagement in the purchase process. Those who score high on recreation-consciousness regard shopping itself as a form of enjoyment.
* Price-conscious: A consumer who exhibits price-and-value consciousness. Price-conscious shoppers carefully shop around seeking lower prices, sales or discounts and are motivated by obtaining the best value for money
* Novelty/fashion-conscious: characterised by a consumer's tendency to seek out new products or new experiences for the sake of excitement; who gain excitement from seeking new things; they like to keep up-to-date with fashions and trends, variety-seeking is associated with this dimension.
* Impulsive: Impulsive consumers are somewhat careless in making purchase decisions, buy on the spur of the moment and are not overly concerned with expenditure levels or obtaining value. Those who score high on impulsive dimensions tend not to be engaged with the object at either a cognitive or emotional level.
* Confused (by overchoice): characterised by a consumer's confusion caused by too many product choices, too many stores or an overload of product information; tend to experience information overload.
* Habitual/brand loyal: characterised by a consumer's tendency to follow a routine purchase pattern on each purchase occasion; consumers have favourite brands or stores and have formed habits in choosing; the purchase decision does not involve much evaluation or shopping around.
Some researchers have adapted Sproles and Kendall's methodology for use in specific countries or cultural groups.<ref>Bauer, H.H., Sauer, N.E., and Becker, C., "Investigating the relationship between product involvement and consumer decision-making styles", Journal of Consumer Behaviour. Vol. 5, 2006 342–54.</ref> Consumer decision styles are important for retailers and marketers because they describe behaviours that are relatively stable over time and for this reason, they are useful for market segmentation.
== Retail format: types of retail outlet ==
. The European Service Directive applies to all retail trade including periodic markets, street traders and peddlers.
Retail stores may be classified by the type of product carried. Softline retailers sell goods that are consumed after a single-use, or have a limited life (typically under three years) in they are normally consumed. Soft goods include clothing, other fabrics, footwear, toiletries, cosmetics, medicines and stationery.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Grocery stores, including supermarkets and hypermarkets, along with convenience stores carry a mix of food products and consumable household items such as detergents, cleansers, personal hygiene products. Retailers selling consumer durables are sometimes known as hardline retailers<ref></ref> – automobiles, appliances, electronics, furniture, sporting goods, lumber, etc., and parts for them. Specialist retailers operate in many industries such as the arts e.g. green grocers, contemporary art galleries, bookstores, handicrafts, musical instruments, gift shops.

Retailers can opt for a format as each provides different retail mix to its customers based on their customer demographics, lifestyle and purchase behavior. An effective format will determine how products are display products, as well as how target customers are attracted.
==Challenges==
To achieve and maintain a foothold in an existing market, a prospective retail establishment must barriers to entry:
* regulatory barriers including:
** restrictions on real-estate purchases, especially as imposed by Municipality and against "big-box" Big-box store
** restrictions on foreign investment in retailers, in terms of both absolute amount of financing provided and percentage share of voting stock (e.g. common stock) purchased
* unfavorable Tax code, especially those designed to penalize or keep out "big box" retailers (see "Regulatory" above)
* absence of developed supply-chain and integrated IT management
* high competitiveness among existing market participants and resulting low profit margins, caused in part by:
** constant advances in product design resulting in constant threat of product obsolescence and price declines for existing inventory
* lack of a properly-educated and/or -trained work-force, often including management, caused in part by loss in business
** lack of educational infrastructure enabling prospective market entrants to respond to the above challenges
* direct e-tailing (for example, through the Internet) and direct delivery to consumers from manufacturers and suppliers, cutting out any retail reseller.<ref>

==Consolidation==
Among retailers and retails chains a lot of consolidation has appeared over the last couple of decades. Between 1988 and 2010, worldwide 40,788 mergers & acquisitions with a total known value of US$2.255 trillion have been announced.<ref></ref> The largest transactions with involvement of retailers in/from the United States have been: the acquisition of Albertson's Inc. for US$17 billion in 2006,<ref></ref> the merger between Federated Department Stores Inc with May Department Stores valued at 16.5 bil. USD in 2005<ref></ref>&nbsp;– now Macy's, and the merger between Kmart and Sears with a value of US$10.9 billion in 2004.<ref></ref>
Between 1985 and 2018 there have been 46,755 mergers or acquisitions conducted globally in the retail sector (either acquirer or target from the retail industry). These deals cumulate to an overall known value of around US$2,561 billion. The three major Retail M&A waves took place in 2000, 2007 and lately in 2017. However the all-time high in terms of number of deals was in 2016 with more than 2,700 deals. In terms of added value 2007 set the record with the US$225 billion.<ref></ref>
Here is a list of the top ten largest deals (ranked by volume) in the Retail Industry:

Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple distribution channel to earn a profit. Retailers satisfy demand identified through a supply chain. The term "retailer" is typically applied where a service provider fills the small orders of many individuals, who are end-users, rather than large orders of a small number of wholesale, corporate or government clientele. Shopping generally refers to the act of Trade products. Sometimes this is done to obtain final goods, including necessities such as food and clothing; sometimes it takes place as a recreational activity. Recreational shopping often involves window shopping and browsing: it does not always result in a purchase.
Retail markets and shops have a very ancient history, dating back to antiquity. Some of the earliest retailers were itinerant peddlers. Over the centuries, retail shops were transformed from little more than "rude booths" to the sophisticated shopping malls of the modern era.
Most modern retailers typically make a variety of strategic level decisions including the type of store, the market to be served, the optimal product assortment, customer service, supporting services and the store's overall market positioning. Once the strategic retail plan is in place, retailers devise the retail mix which includes product, price, place, promotion, personnel, and presentation. In the digital age, an increasing number of retailers are seeking to reach broader markets by selling through multiple channels, including both bricks and mortar and Online shopping. Digital technologies are also changing the way that consumers pay for goods and services. Retailing support services may also include the provision of credit, delivery services, advisory services, stylist services and a range of other supporting services.
Retail shops occur in a diverse range of types and in many different contexts&nbsp;– from strip mall in residential area through to large, indoor shopping malls. Shopping streets may restrict traffic to pedestrians only. Sometimes a shopping street has a partial or full roof to create a more comfortable shopping environment – protecting customers from various types of weather conditions such as extreme temperatures, winds or precipitation. Forms of non-shop retailing include online retailing (a type of electronic-commerce used for business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions) and mail order.
