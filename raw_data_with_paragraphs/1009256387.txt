Retrieved 2012-04-11.</ref> and attended Methodist College Belfast boarding school in Northern Ireland. After dropping out of his Combined Studies course at Brighton Polytechnic, he became a Gravedigger.<ref name=":0"></ref> He then began his television career as a sports personality impersonator on David Essex in 1982.
He adopted the surname "Barrie" as there was already an actor named Chris Brown on the Equity UK lists. He was a regular on Saturday Live, amongst performers like Fry and Laurie, Rik Mayall and Ben Elton. Barrie provided the voice of Ronald Reagan in the pop song "Two Tribes" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, as well as various vocalizations for other tracks by FGTH and Art of Noise. He also appeared as an impressionist on the BBC's Carrott's Lib between 1983 and 1984, and he starred in his own sketch show Pushing Up Daisies (re-titled Coming Next for the following season) from 1984 to 1985 alongside Hale and Pace and Carla Mendonça.<ref></ref> In 1987, he appeared as a French Revolutionary in Blackadder the Third (episode "Nob and Nobility") and did various parts in The Young Ones both as an actor and a voice-over.
==Red Dwarf==
Barrie has played the character Arnold J. Rimmer in all twelve series of Red Dwarf, appearing in almost every episode of the series, absent only for a period during series 7.<ref></ref> When an unsold pilot for an American version of the show was produced, Barrie was invited to reprise his role as Rimmer. He passed up the offer because of the constraint of the five-series contract.<ref></ref>
He starred in the 2020 film Red Dwarf: The Promised Land, alongside the main cast of Craig Charles, Danny John-Jules and Robert Llewellyn (Series 3-present).<ref></ref>
In addition to starring in the TV series, Barrie also narrated the first two Red Dwarf Books, Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers (1992) and Better Than Life (1995), including using his vocal talents to recreate the voices of the other characters, as they sound in the show.
==The Brittas Empire==
Barrie played Gordon Brittas, the title role in The Brittas Empire, a BBC sitcom running from January 1991 to February 1997 for seven series, with 52 episodes, including two Christmas specials.<ref name=":0" /> Brittas was the well-meaning, but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre. Each episode featured a disastrous occurrence, which Brittas was sure he could sort out, oblivious to the fact he was usually its cause.
In 2014, Barrie reprised his role as Gordon Brittas in the music video for Little Mix's version of "Word Up!".<ref></ref><ref name="metro"></ref>
In 2017 the cast reunited for the reopening of Ringwood Leisure centre where a lot of the series was recorded.<ref></ref>
