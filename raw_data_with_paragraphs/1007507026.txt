This list consists of many notable people who are transgender. The individual listings note the subject's nationality and main occupation.
In some non-Western, ancient or medieval societies, transgender people may be seen as a different gender entirely, and there may be a separate category for them that is different from the binary of 'man' or 'woman'. These people might be described collectively as occupying a third gender role. These cultures may have traditional social and ceremonial roles for third gender people, which are different from men's or women's roles and social spaces.
While cross-dressing is not synonymous with being transgender, some of the persons listed here crossdressed during wartime for various purposes.
